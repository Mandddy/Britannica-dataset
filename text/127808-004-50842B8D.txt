Chongqing, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’ung-ch’ing, conventional Chungking,  city (shi) and provincial-level municipality (zhixiashi), southwest-central China. The leading river port, transportation hub, and commercial and industrial centre of the upper Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) basin, the city is located some 1,400 miles (2,250 km) from the sea, at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing rivers. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) it was the capital of Nationalist China. The city was named Chongqing (“Double-Blessed”) in 1189 under the Nan (Southern) Song dynasty (1127–1279 ce). At that time the city occupied a commanding position between the prefectures of Shunqing (centred on modern Nanchong) to the north and Shaoqing (centred on modern Pengshui) to the east.
Chongqing city was under the administration of Sichuan province from 1954, but in 1997 it was separated from the province and designated a provincial-level municipality under the direct administration of the central government, the fourth one (after Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) to be established. At that time the entire eastern portion of Sichuan was incorporated into the municipality, which greatly expanded Chongqing’s overall land area and population. Both the city and municipality have experienced quick development since then. In addition to Sichuan to the west, the municipality is bordered by the provinces of Shaanxi to the north, Hubei to the east, Hunan to the southeast, and Guizhou to the south. Area Chongqing municipality, 31,700 square miles (82,000 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) city, 4,776,000; (2010 prelim.) Chongqing municipality, 28,846,170.
