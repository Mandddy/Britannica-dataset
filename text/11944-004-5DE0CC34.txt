George Farquhar,  (born 1678, Londonderry, County Derry, Ire.—died  April 29, 1707, London, Eng.) Irish playwright of real comic power who wrote for the English stage at the beginning of the 18th century. He stood out from his contemporaries for originality of dialogue and a stage sense that doubtless stemmed from his experience as an actor.
The son of a clergyman, Farquhar entered Trinity College, Dublin, as a sizar (one who received a college allowance in return for performing menial duties), but he preferred working as an unsuccessful actor at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. During a performance of John Dryden’s Indian Emperour, he failed to distinguish between a tipped foil and a deadly rapier, gravely wounding a fellow actor. After this incident he abandoned acting, and, encouraged by a leading actor, Robert Wilks, with whom he had acted in Dublin, Farquhar decided to go to London to write comedy. His early plays were primarily spirited variations on a theme: young men have their fling for four acts and reform, unconvincingly, in the fifth. The plays have freshness, however, as well as wit and a lively human sympathy.
