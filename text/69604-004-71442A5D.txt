Harriet Goodhue Hosmer,  (born October 9, 1830, Watertown, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 21, 1908, Watertown)  American sculptor, one of the leading female sculptors working in Rome in the 19th century and perhaps the only one to win complete financial independence through her artistic work.
Hosmer was encouraged by the actress Fanny Kemble to pursue her natural talent in the art of sculpture. She established a studio at home and made what progress she could on her own, while furthering her knowledge of anatomy by taking private lessons at the medical school of St. Louis (Missouri) University. In 1852 she traveled to Rome to study under the British sculptor John Gibson while living with an older friend, the actress Charlotte Cushman. As Hosmer developed as an artist, she became a favourite in the circles of English and American expatriates in Rome, counting Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning among her friends. A group including Hosmer and fellow sculptors Edmonia Lewis and Emma Stebbins was later famously, and slightly disparagingly, referred to as the “white marmorean flock” by the author Henry James.
