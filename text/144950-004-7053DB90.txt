Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, coastal habitat conservation area in southern Texas, U.S., located about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Corpus Christi. The refuge, parts of which are jointly administered by state and federal agencies, covers a total of 181 square miles (469 square km) on the Gulf of Mexico, including large tracts of land on Matagorda Island and on a broad peninsula between San Antonio Bay and St. Charles Bay, as well as three separate, smaller tracts. It consists mostly of oak upland and grassland but does have extensive ponds, lakes, salt marshes, and freshwater marshes. Because of the refuge’s location along the Gulf Coast and its variety of habitats, it has one of the highest species counts in the national refuge system. It is the principal wintering ground for the rare whooping crane and also attracts almost 400 species of other waterfowl and other birds, who vary with the seasons—especially geese, ducks, pelicans, herons, egrets, gulls, sundial cranes, roseate spoonbills, ibises, quail, osprey, a variety of migrating songbirds, and various shorebirds. Deer, javelinas (peccaries), armadillos, alligators, and turkeys are also abundant.
Bird-watching is the primary recreational activity. Although much of the refuge is closed to visitors, available facilities include an observation tower, an automobile touring road, a wildlife education centre, and some hiking trails. The refuge was established in 1937 by presidential executive order to save the whooping cranes, then faced with extinction. The refuge’s resources are still largely devoted to this purpose, and Aransas has helped boost the species’ population. Headquarters are in Austwell.
