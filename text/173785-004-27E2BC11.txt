Sir Dudley North,  (born May 16, 1641, Westminster, England [now in London]—died December 31, 1691, London) English merchant, civil servant, and economist who was an early advocate of what later came to be called laissez-faire.
North entered the eastern Mediterranean trade at an early age and spent many years residing in Smyrna and Constantinople (now İzmir and Istanbul, respectively), finally returning to England, a wealthy man, in 1680. He then served under Charles II as one of the sheriffs of the City of London and received a knighthood; under James II he was appointed a commissioner of customs. A confirmed Tory, he retired from public affairs shortly after the Glorious Revolution (1688–89).
