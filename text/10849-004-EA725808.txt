Jean-Guillaume, Baron Hyde de Neuville,  (born Jan. 24, 1776, La Charité, France—died  May 28, 1857, Paris) diplomat and one of the most consistent defenders of Bourbon Legitimism.
Devoted to Louis XVI, Hyde de Neuville remained a royalist agent after the outbreak of the Revolution. After taking part in a royalist insurrection in Berry (1796), he attempted first to discredit the Directory, then to convince Napoleon to reestablish the Bourbons on the throne. He left France in 1804, reached the United States in 1806, and remained there until 1814.
