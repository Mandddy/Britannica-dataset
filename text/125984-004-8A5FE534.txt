Jon Stewart, original name Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz  (born November 28, 1962, New York, New York, U.S.) American comedian best known for hosting the satiric television news program The Daily Show.
Stewart graduated from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1984 and then held a series of odd jobs before pursuing a career in comedy. In the late 1980s he began performing stand-up comedy under the name Jon Stewart and quickly became popular on the club circuit. By the early 1990s he was appearing regularly on television, and, after hosting the MTV series You Wrote It, You Watch It (1992), he was given his own program, The Jon Stewart Show. Featuring celebrity interviews and comedy sketches, it debuted in 1993 but lasted only two years, despite receiving positive reviews. Stewart, who made his big-screen debut in the 1994 film Mixed Nuts, also appeared in a number of films, including Half Baked (1998), The Faculty (1998), and Big Daddy (1999).
