Starling, any of a number of birds composing most of the family Sturnidae (order Passeriformes), especially Sturnus vulgaris, a 20-cm (8-inch) chunky iridescent black bird with a long sharp bill. It was introduced from Europe and Asia to most parts of the world (South America excepted). The millions in North America are descendants of 100 birds released in New York City in 1890–91. They often damage fruit and grain crops—though they also consume harmful insects—and usurp native songbirds’ nest holes. S. vulgaris feeds on the ground and flies in tight flocks; vocal year-round, it mimics other birds’ notes and utters wheezy sounds of its own. They frequently form large flocks, called murmurations, which may move in synchrony in order to avoid predators.
The bare-eyed, or pied, starling (or mynah, S. contra), from India to Java, is black, white, and reddish-brown, with yellow eye skin. Glossy starlings, with highly iridescent plumage, include the superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus) of eastern Africa and the shining starling (Aplonis metallica) of Pacific Islands and northeastern Australia. The 36-cm golden-breasted, or regal, starling (Lamprotornis regius) of eastern Africa, is green, blue, and yellow, with a long tail. The wattled starling (Creatophora cinerea) is brown, gray, and white; uniquely, the breeding male becomes bald, showing bright yellow skin, and grows large black wattles on the crown and throat.
