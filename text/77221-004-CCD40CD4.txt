Liam Neeson, in full William Neeson  (born June 7, 1952, Ballymena, Northern Ireland) Irish American actor perhaps best known for playing powerful leading men.
Neeson was an accomplished boxer in his early years. He abandoned that activity, however, and entered Queen’s University Belfast with the intention of studying physics and computer science. After a year he left college and worked as a forklift driver for a time, but he then began studying to become a teacher. He also took drama classes, and in 1976 he joined Belfast’s Lyric Players Theatre. Two years later Neeson joined the prestigious Abbey Theatre in Dublin, and in 1979 he made his motion picture debut in Christiana, a religious educational film. He followed that with the role of Sir Gawain in Excalibur (1981), which led to supporting roles in such films as The Bounty (1984), The Mission (1986), and Suspect (1987). Among his television appearances were the miniseries Ellis Island and such series as Miami Vice, both in 1984.
