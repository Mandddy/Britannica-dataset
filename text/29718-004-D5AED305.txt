Acorn and nut weevil (subfamily Curculioninae), any of approximately 45 species of weevils in the family Curculionidae (order Coleoptera) that have extremely long and slender snouts, which in females can be almost twice the length of the body. The mandibles are located at the tip of the snout. Eggs are deposited in holes chewed in a nut. These weevils are common in both Europe and North America. Different species prefer certain nuts: Curculio proboscides attacks large chestnuts, for example, and C. rectus and C. baculi feed on acorns.
