Arishima Takeo,  (born March 4, 1878, Tokyo, Japan—died  June 9, 1923, Karuizawa) Japanese novelist known for his novel Aru onna (1919; A Certain Woman) and for his strong humanitarian views.
Arishima was the son of a talented and aristocratic family; his younger brothers included the painter Arishima Ikuma and the novelist Satomi Ton. He attended the Peers School (Gakushūin), where he was chosen as a companion to the crown prince, the future emperor Taishō. Although graduates of this school normally became military officers, Arishima disliked arms so much that he decided to become a farmer instead. He went on to Sapporo Agricultural School (now Hokkaido University), which was noted as a centre of modern thought and of Christianity. He excelled in his studies, especially in English (his lengthy diary was kept mainly in English), and became a devout Christian. After graduating in 1896, he went to the United States, where he spent three years at Haverford College and Harvard University. He left Harvard to live in Washington, D.C., where, in the Library of Congress, he read the works of Henrik Ibsen, Leo Tolstoy, Maksim Gorky, and other modern writers. His first story, set on the Dnieper River, was written in Washington.
