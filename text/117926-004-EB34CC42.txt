Battle of Bennington, (August 16, 1777), in the American Revolution, victory by American militiamen defending colonial military stores in Bennington, Vermont, against a British raiding party.
In early August the British commander, General John Burgoyne, hoped to capture needed supplies and overawe New Englanders by dispatching a well-equipped regiment to Bennington under the German colonel Friedrich Baum. On the 16th, Baumâ€™s force of 800 British, Germans, loyalists, and Indians was decisively defeated by about 1,600 colonial troops gathered from neighbouring militia by Ethan Allen and Seth Warner and led by General John Stark. Reinforcements on both sides arrived too late to influence the outcome, and about 700 of the British forces were taken prisoner. The outcome of this engagement went far in enhancing American morale.
