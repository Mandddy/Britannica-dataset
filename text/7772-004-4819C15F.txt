Consanguinity, kinship characterized by the sharing of common ancestors. The word is derived from the Latin consanguineus, “of common blood,” which implied that Roman individuals were of the same father and thus shared in the right to his inheritance.
Kin are of two basic kinds: consanguineous (sharing common ancestors) and affinal (related by marriage). In some societies other pairs of individuals also treat each other as relatives—for example, the wives of a pair of brothers, relatives by adoption, and godparents who have special kinlike relationships (fictive kin). Consanguineous kinship is a universal type; it includes those with common ancestors and excludes individuals who lack ancestors in common.
