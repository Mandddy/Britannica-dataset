Shirley Booth, original name Thelma Booth Ford  (born August 30, 1898, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died October 16, 1992, North Chatham, Mass.) American actress who was equally deft in both dramatic and comedic roles and who was the recipient of three Tony Awards, two Emmy Awards, and an Oscar.
An amateur actress at age 12, Booth made her professional debut in a regional theatre production of The Cat and the Canary (1923) and her Broadway debut two years later in Hell’s Bells (1925), a production that also featured the young Humphrey Bogart. She appeared in small roles on Broadway and in stock companies before scoring her first Broadway success with Three Men on a Horse (1935). Booth gradually developed a reputation as one of Broadway’s finest actresses and appeared in more than 40 plays during the following two decades, including Excursion (1937), The Philadelphia Story (1939), My Sister Eileen (1940), Tomorrow the World (1943), and Hollywood Pinafore (1945). She received her first Tony Award for Goodbye, My Fancy in 1949 and a second Tony the following year for one of her hallmark roles, that of the slovenly housewife Lola in William Inge’s Come Back, Little Sheba. She next delivered a highly praised performance in the musical version of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1951) and won her final Tony Award two seasons later for Time of the Cuckoo (1953).
