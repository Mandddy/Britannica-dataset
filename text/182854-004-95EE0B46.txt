Night of the Living Dead, American horror film, released in 1968, that established the pattern for modern zombie movies by disassociating the monsters from Vodou and by using contemporary settings. It was the first feature film directed by George Romero.
Barbra (played by Judith O’Dea) and Johnny (Russell W. Streiner) are visiting their father’s grave in a rural Pennsylvania cemetery when a stranger attacks them. During the struggle, Johnny is killed, but Barbra manages to escape. She seeks refuge in a farmhouse, where she finds the half-eaten corpse of the owner. Terrified, she runs into the yard, where she encounters an army of ghouls. A man named Ben (Duane Jones) pulls Barbra back into the house and boards up the dwelling. Five other people are found hiding in the cellar, and together the survivors struggle to stay alive against the oncoming horde. A reporter on the television informs them that the recently dead are coming back to life and that these monsters need to eat live flesh. The reason for the revivification is never completely explained, but radiation fallout from a recent space probe is a suggested cause. Save for Ben, all of the people in the farmhouse are eventually killed and become zombies. Ironically, Ben survives the night but is then mistaken for a ghoul and is killed by the posse that had been assembled to rescue survivors.
