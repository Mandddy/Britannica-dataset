Chinese chess, Chinese (Pinyin) Xiangqi (Wade-Giles) Hsiang-ch’i ,  strategy board game played in China from about ad 700. Like orthodox chess, Chinese chess is believed to have been derived from an Indian board game known as chaturanga.
As in Western chess, the object of Chinese chess is to capture the opponent’s king (also called general in Chinese chess), and each player starts with an army of 16 pieces (one side traditionally red, which moves first, and the other black) on opposite sides of a game board. While the game boards appear superficially similar—the Western board is 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;8, and the Chinese board is 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;8 with an extra horizontal void, known as a river, between the two halves—they represent quite different battlefields. Unlike Western chess, which is played on the 64 two-toned squares, Chinese chess is played on the intersection of the lines, known as points, that form the squares. This pattern was familiar to the Chinese from the game of go, which was well known before chess arrived from India. Thus, Chinese chess is actually played on a 9&nbsp;×&nbsp;10 board, or 90 points, rather than 64 squares. In addition, two special regions of nine points, known as the red palace and the black palace, are marked off by diagonal lines in the middle along each edge near the players. Each king, together with two accompanying mandarins (advisers, assistants, scholars, or guards), is restricted to its own palace.
