New York Central Railroad Company, one of the major American railroads that connected the East Coast with the interior. Founded in 1853, it was a consolidation of 10 small railroads that paralleled the Erie Canal between Albany and Buffalo; the earliest was the Mohawk and Hudson, New York state’s first railway, which opened in 1831.
The New York Central’s moving spirit was Erastus Corning (1794–1872), four times mayor of Albany, who for 20 years had been president of the Utica and Schenectady, one of the consolidated roads. He served as president of the New York Central until 1864. In 1867 Cornelius Vanderbilt won control, after beating down the Central’s stock, and combined it with his New York and Hudson railroads running from Manhattan to Albany.
