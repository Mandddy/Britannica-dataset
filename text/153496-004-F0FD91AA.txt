Rashtrakuta dynasty, Hindu dynasty that ruled the Deccan and neighbouring areas of India from about 755 to 975 ce.
Probably originally Dravidian farmers, they were the royal family of Lattalur (Latur, near Osmanabad). They spoke Kannada but also knew the northern Deccan language. Under Rashtrakuta, who defeated a rival dynasty, the Chalukyas, the Deccan empire became the second greatest political unit in India, covering the area from Malwa in western India to Kanchi (Kanchipuram) in the southeast. The importance of the Rashtrakutas during this era is indicated by the fact that a Muslim traveler wrote of the king as being one of the four great rulers of the worldâ€”the others being the caliph (ruler of the Muslims) and the emperors of Byzantium and China.
