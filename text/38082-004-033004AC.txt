Sir Charles Napier, Count Napier de São Vicente,  (born March 6, 1786, near Falkirk, Stirling, Scotland—died November 6, 1860, near Catherington, Hampshire, England) admiral in the Portuguese and British navies, the controversial commander of the British Baltic Fleet during the Crimean War of 1853–56. Created Conde Napier de São Vicente in the Portuguese peerage, he was less elegantly known in Great Britain as “Black Charley” and “Mad Charley.”
Napier became a midshipman in 1800 and served in the Napoleonic Wars and in the War of 1812 against the United States. In 1831 he was in the Azores to assist supporters of the Portuguese princess Maria da Glória (afterward Queen Maria II). Subsequently, as commander of the Portuguese loyalist navy, he destroyed the fleet of Dom Miguel, pretender to the Portuguese throne, off Cape St. Vincent on July 5, 1833. The next year he directed the loyalist forces in the defense of Lisbon against the Miguelites.
