Gary Oldman, in full Leonard Gary Oldman  (born March 21, 1958, London, England) English film actor known for his chameleonic ability to evince characters ranging from nebbishes to snarling villains.
Oldman was raised in a working-class family in London, the youngest of three children. After leaving school at age 16, he began acting in productions staged by the Greenwich and Lewisham Young People’s Theatre. He attended the Rose Bruford Training College for Speech and Drama (now the Rose Bruford College of Theatre and Performance) on scholarship, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in theatre in 1979. After starring in repertory productions in York and Colchester, he was accepted as a member of the Glasgow Citizens Theatre, appearing in such productions as Massacre at Paris (1980) and Chinchilla (1980). Oldman returned to London, where he continued to pursue theatre work. Meanwhile, he made his film debut in Remembrance (1982). He then embarked upon a series of performances at the Royal Court Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Theatre; his 1985 performance as Scopey in Edward Bond’s The Pope’s Wedding at the former venue won particular acclaim.
