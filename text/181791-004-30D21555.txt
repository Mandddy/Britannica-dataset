Aasmund Olafson Vinje,  (born April 6, 1818, Vinje, Norway—died July 30, 1870, Gran) poet and journalist who wrote some of the finest lyric poems in Norwegian literature.
The son of a poor tenant farmer, Vinje took a law degree but then struggled to support himself by teaching, writing, and working as a government clerk. In 1851 he began writing for an Oslo newspaper, and in 1858 he started a newspaper of his own, Dølen (“The Dalesman”), in which he helped establish the new rural variant of the Norwegian language known as New Norwegian, or Nynorsk. In his newspaper Vinje wrote about everything from philosophy and literature to politics. It was not until he was 40 that Vinje started writing poetry, mostly lyrics about mountain scenes and other aspects of nature. His best-known work is Ferdaminni fraa sumaren 1860 (1861; “Travel Memoirs from the Summer of 1860”); this book combines essays and poems in a witty and amusing account of Vinje’s journey on foot from Oslo to Trondheim to report on the coronation of the new Swedish-Norwegian king. His other more widely known works are his English-language account of England in A Norseman’s View of Britain and the British (1863), Diktsamling (1864; “Poetry Collection”), and the poetic cycle Storegut (1866; “Big Boy”). Vinje’s lyric poems are notable for their simplicity and directness and their deep appreciation of nature. His prose writings are marked by their abundant common sense and an amusing, and sometimes caustic, wit.
