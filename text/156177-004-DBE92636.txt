Alexander Payne, in full Constantine Alexander Payne  (born February 10, 1961, Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.) American director, screenwriter, and producer, noted for films mixing sardonic humour with humanistic drama in prosaic contemporary settings.
Payne grew up in Omaha, where his mother was a professor of Romance languages and his father ran a restaurant. As a child, he took an interest in the familyâ€™s 8-mm film projector, and he eventually made his own amateur movies. After studying history and Latin American literature at Stanford University (B.A., 1984), Payne attended film school at the University of California, Los Angeles (M.F.A., 1990). His thesis film, The Passion of Martin, about a love-struck photographer, won him attention from Hollywood and was screened at the Sundance Film Festival. A development deal with Universal Pictures, however, ultimately proved fruitless.
