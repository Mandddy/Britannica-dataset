Clemmys, genus of small, terrestrial or semi-aquatic turtles in the family Emydidae. The genus contains four species, all restricted to North America. Earlier classifications included several European and Asian species that are now placed in the genus Mauremys.
Clemmys females lay fewer than a dozen eggs in early summer that hatch by fall. Three of the species occur in the eastern United States and one in the Pacific coast region. The bog turtle (C. muhlenbergi) is an officially recognized threatened species.
