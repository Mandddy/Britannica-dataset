Osvaldo Golijov,  (born Dec. 5, 1960, La Plata, Arg.) Argentine composer, known for his eclectic approach to concert music, who became one of the most successful classical artists of the early 21st century in the United States.
Golijov was born to Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. He studied music with his mother, a piano teacher, and at the local conservatory in Argentina. He moved to Israel in 1983 and studied in Jerusalem, and in 1986 he moved to the United States, where he received a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania (as a student of the American composer George Crumb). He studied further at Tanglewood, in Lenox, Mass., winning the Koussevitzky Composition Prize in 1990. A year later he joined the faculty at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.; he was also on the faculty of the Boston Conservatory from 2001.
