A. Philip Randolph, in full Asa Philip Randolph   (born April 15, 1889, Crescent City, Fla., U.S.—died  May 16, 1979, New York, N.Y.) trade unionist and civil-rights leader who was a dedicated and persistent leader in the struggle for justice and parity for the black American community.
The son of a Methodist minister, Randolph moved to the Harlem district of New York City in 1911. He attended City College at night and, with Chandler Owen, founded (1912) an employment agency, attempting, through it, to organize black workers. In 1917, following the entry of the United States in World War I, the two men founded a magazine, The Messenger (after 1929, Black Worker), that called for more positions in the war industry and the armed forces for blacks. After the war, Randolph lectured at New York’s Rand School of Social Science and ran unsuccessfully for offices on the Socialist Party ticket.
