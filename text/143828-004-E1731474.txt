Alejandro González Iñárritu,  (born August 15, 1963, Mexico City, Mexico) Mexican director and producer whose movies—which often featured interconnected stories and a nonlinear narrative—placed him at the forefront of the Mexican film renaissance in the early 21st century.
González Iñárritu was expelled from school at age 16. His first job as a commercial sailor persuaded him to complete his education at the Ibero-American University, Mexico City. In 1984 González Iñárritu became a popular disc jockey at Mexico’s top-rated radio station, where he pieced together playlists into a loose narrative arc; he credited this experience with cultivating his interest in storytelling. He later became the youngest producer for Televisa, Mexico’s premiere TV company. After leaving Televisa, he founded (1991) Zeta Film and moved into advertising as a writer and director of television commercials. From 1988 to 1990 he concentrated on his first love—music—and wrote the scores for six Mexican films. During this time he became acquainted with Mexican novelist and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga, and the two began a long and fruitful collaboration. The pair continued to correspond and develop ideas when González Iñárritu traveled to the United States to study filmmaking, and they transformed one of their early ideas—about three interconnected stories set in a grim yet realistic Mexico City—into the screenplay for González Iñárritu’s feature directorial debut, Amores perros (2000).
