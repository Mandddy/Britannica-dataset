John Howard Lawson,  (born Sept. 25, 1894, New York City—died  Aug. 11, 1977, San Francisco) U.S. playwright, screenwriter, and member of the “Hollywood Ten,” who was jailed (1948–49) and blacklisted for his refusal to tell the House Committee on Un-American Activities about his political allegiances.
Lawson’s early works, such as Roger Bloomer (1923) and Processional (1925), are notable examples of Expressionism. He later portrayed problems of the working class: The International (1928) depicts a world revolution of the proletariat; Marching Song (1937) concerns a sit-down strike. Lawson’s plays emphasize ideology and innovation and are powerful and effective.
