Transmission electron microscope (TEM), type of electron microscope that has three essential systems: (1) an electron gun, which produces the electron beam, and the condenser system, which focuses the beam onto the object, (2) the image-producing system, consisting of the objective lens, movable specimen stage, and intermediate and projector lenses, which focus the electrons passing through the specimen to form a real, highly magnified image, and (3) the image-recording system, which converts the electron image into some form perceptible to the human eye. The image-recording system usually consists of a fluorescent screen for viewing and focusing the image and a digital camera for permanent records. In addition, a vacuum system, consisting of pumps and their associated gauges and valves, and power supplies are required.
The source of electrons, the cathode, is a heated V-shaped tungsten filament or, in high-performance instruments, a sharply pointed rod of a material such as lanthanum hexaboride. The filament is surrounded by a control grid, sometimes called a Wehnelt cylinder, with a central aperture arranged on the axis of the column; the apex of the cathode is arranged to lie at or just above or below this aperture. The cathode and control grid are at a negative potential equal to the desired accelerating voltage and are insulated from the rest of the instrument. The final electrode of the electron gun is the anode, which takes the form of a disk with an axial hole. Electrons leave the cathode and shield, accelerate toward the anode, and, if the stabilization of the high voltage is adequate, pass through the central aperture at a constant energy. The control and alignment of the electron gun are critical in ensuring satisfactory operation.
