Chili pepper, any of several species and cultivars of very hot, pungent peppers in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Chili peppers are native to the Americas and are cultivated in warm climates around the world. Many of the most-common chili peppers are cultivars of Capsicum annuum, including the cayenne, jalape√±o, serrano, and Thai chili peppers. Some of the hottest chili peppers are cultivars of C. chinense, including the habanero, the Carolina reaper, and the ghost chili pepper, or bhut jolokia, though tabasco is a cultivar of C. frutescens. Chili peppers can be eaten fresh or dried and are used to make chili powder and to flavour barbecue, hot curry, and other spicy sauces.
