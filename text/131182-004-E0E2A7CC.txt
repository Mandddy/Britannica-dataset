Watch, portable timepiece that has a movement driven either by spring or by electricity and that is designed to be worn or carried in the pocket.
The first watches appeared shortly after 1500, early examples being made by Peter Henlein, a locksmith in NÃ¼rnberg, Ger. The escapement used in the early watches was the same as that used in the early clocks, the verge. Early watches were made notably in Germany and at Blois in France, among other countries, and were generally carried in the hand or worn on a chain around the neck. They usually had only one hand for the hours.
