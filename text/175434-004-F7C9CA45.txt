Adam’s Rib, American romantic comedy film, directed by George Cukor and released in 1949, that was a vehicle for the powerhouse pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in a classic battle of the sexes.
The plot involves a husband and wife (played by Tracy and Hepburn) who are lawyers on opposite sides of an attempted murder case that has the overtones of female empowerment. The courtroom dramatics spill over into the lawyers’ home life with amusing consequences, and an opportunistic neighbour (played by David Wayne) wastes no time in putting the moves on Hepburn when he sees her marriage in turmoil.
