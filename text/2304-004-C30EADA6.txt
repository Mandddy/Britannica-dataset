Courtauld Institute Galleries, museum administered by the University of London and by the Samuel Courtauld Trust to promote the study and research of art history. The galleries are located in Somerset House, the Strand, in the London borough of Westminster.
The Courtauld Institute of Art was founded in 1931 with a gift of French Impressionist and Postimpressionist paintings by the wealthy silk manufacturer Samuel Courtauld (1876–1947), but the collection was not made available to the public until 1958, when a gallery was opened in Woburn Square, Bloomsbury. In 1990 the collection was transferred to Somerset House (built 1770s–90s), which was designed by Sir William Chambers originally as government offices.
