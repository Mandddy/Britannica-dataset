Phocis, Modern Greek Fokída ,  district of ancient central Greece, extending northward from the Gulf of Corinth (Modern Greek: Korinthiakós) over the range of Mount Parnassus (Parnassós) to the Locrian Mountains, which formed the northern frontier. In the fertile Cephissus River valley, between the two mountain ranges, lay most of the Phocian settlements: Amphicleia (or Amphicaea), Tithorea, Elatea, Hyampolis, Abae, and Daulis. A mountain spur running south from Mount Parnassus to the gulf separated the city of Crisa and its port, Cyrrha, on the Crisaean plain from the port city of Anticyra.
Its early history is obscure; Phocis was mainly pastoral, and the population was thought to be of the Aeolians, one of the earliest Greek-speaking peoples in the peninsula. Before the 6th century bce, however, Boeotians from the east and Thessalians from the north encroached on their territory. Traditionally, the Phocians controlled the sanctuary of Delphi; pilgrims landing at Cyrrha on their way to the sacred oracle were tolled heavily on the road through Crisa. Galled by this impiety, a coalition of Greek states in about 590 bce proclaimed a sacred war, destroyed Crisa, and put the sanctuary under the control of a council administered jointly by neighbouring communities. The irresolute conduct of the Phocians contributed to the Greek defeat by Persia at Thermopylae (480); at Plataea they were on the Persian side. In 449 or 448 the Spartans expelled the Phocians from Delphi, but, with the help of their new ally, Athens, they soon recaptured it. When Athenian land power declined, Phocis wavered again and became an ally of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 bce).
