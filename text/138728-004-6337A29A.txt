Hopscotch, age-old children’s game based on an idea of not treading on lines. Variations of the game are played in many countries. The game’s English name expresses its object: to hop over the “scotch,” a line, or scratch, drawn on the ground. Lines are drawn in a variety of patterns. Spaces in the diagrams are numbered, and they must be traversed in order.
In one version of the game, the player tosses a small, flat marker such as a stone or a beanbag into the first numbered space. If the marker does not land clearly in the correct space, without touching a line, the player loses a turn. If the stone does land fairly, the player hops on one foot to the second square and thence through the succeeding squares, in order and without touching a line, falling, or dropping the trailing foot. In some diagrams there are certain pairs of squares where the player jumps with both feet. In other diagrams, certain squares may designate rest spaces, in which the player may put both feet down. Upon reaching the last numbered square, the player turns and moves through the spaces as before, lifts the marker, and hops out of the diagram. A player who completes the diagram without making a mistake may continue, tossing the marker into the second square, hopping into the first space then over the second and into the third, and so on, until the whole diagram has been played in this manner. On completing the diagram, the player may initial any one of its spaces, which space the other players must then avoid, although the initialing player may use it as a rest space. The game ends by mutual consent or when all spaces have been initialed. The player who has initialed the most spaces is the winner.
