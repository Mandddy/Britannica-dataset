Li Bai, also spelled Li Bo, Wade-Giles romanization Li Pai or Li Po, courtesy name (zi) Taibai, literary name (hao) Qinglian Jushi  (born 701, Jiangyou, Sichuan province, China—died 762, Dangtu, Anhui province) Chinese poet who rivaled Du Fu for the title of China’s greatest poet.
Li Bai liked to regard himself as belonging to the imperial family, but he actually belonged to a less exalted family of the same surname. At age 24 he left home for a period of wandering, after which he married and lived with his wife’s family in Anlu (now in Hubei province). He had already begun to write poetry, some of which he showed to various officials in the vain hope of becoming employed as a secretary. After another nomadic period, in 742 he arrived at Chang’an, the Tang dynasty capital, no doubt hoping to be given a post at court. No official post was forthcoming, but he was accepted into a group of distinguished court poets. In the autumn of 744 he began his wanderings again.
