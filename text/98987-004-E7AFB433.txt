Métis, indigenous nation of Canada that has combined Native American and European cultural practices since at least the 17th century. Their language, Michif, which is a French and Cree trade language, is also called French Cree or Métis. The first Métis were the children of indigenous women and European fur traders in the Red River area of what is now the province of Manitoba. They cultivated a distinctive way of life; their culture, particularly their clothing, artwork, music, and dance, can be characterized as colourful and unique.
In the 21st century, Michif was spoken by some 800 individuals in the United States (Turtle Mountain Reservation, North Dakota) and Canada (scattered locations). The word métis, which means “mixed” in French, can be used of any aboriginal (First Nation) person of mixed descent, but the Métis who are of mixed French and Cree descent are the only speakers of Michif. There are several varieties of Michif in Canada.
