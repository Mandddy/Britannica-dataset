Nellie Bly, pseudonym of Elizabeth Cochrane, also spelled Cochran  (born May 5, 1864, Cochran’s Mills, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 27, 1922, New York, New York) American journalist whose around-the-world race against a fictional record brought her world renown.
Elizabeth Cochran (she later added a final “e” to Cochran) received scant formal schooling. She began her career in 1885 in her native Pennsylvania as a reporter for the Pittsburgh Dispatch, to which she had sent an angry letter to the editor in response to an article the newspaper had printed entitled “What Girls Are Good For” (not much, according to the article). The editor was so impressed with her writing that he gave her a job.
