Alexander,  (born c. 870—died  June 6, 913, Constantinople) sole Byzantine emperor from May 11, 912, and third son of the emperor Basil I. He founded the Macedonian dynasty and caused the renewal of warfare between Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire.
Alexander was crowned co-emperor with his brother Leo VI in 879 after the death of their elder brother, Constantine, but he remained inactive in state affairs until after Leo’s death in May 912. Sending Leo VI’s fourth wife, Zoe, to a nunnery, he replaced Leo’s advisers and reinstated the deposed patriarch, Nicholas Mysticus. Alexander’s refusal to pay the annual tribute owed to the Bulgars by the treaty of 896 precipitated war with Symeon, their powerful and aggressive king. Alexander declared his nephew, Leo’s young son, later Constantine VII, his heir to the Byzantine throne and was co-regent with him for several months.
