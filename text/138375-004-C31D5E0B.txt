Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also called Obamacare,  U.S. health care reform legislation, signed into law by Pres. Barack Obama in March 2010, which included provisions that required most individuals to secure health insurance or pay fines, made coverage easier and less costly to obtain, cracked down on abusive insurance practices, and attempted to rein in rising costs of health care. The PPACA was widely considered the most far-reaching health care reform act since the passage of Medicare, the U.S. government program guaranteeing health insurance for the elderly, in 1965.
A centrepiece of Obama’s campaign for the presidency was reform of the U.S. health care system—one that left some 45 million people uninsured. In February 2009, just one month after his inauguration, Obama addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress, imploring them that the time was right for overhauling health care:[W]e must also address the crushing cost of health care. This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every thirty seconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans to lose their homes. In the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. And in each of these years, one million more Americans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. And it’s one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget.
