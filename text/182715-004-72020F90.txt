Leone Leoni,  (born 1509, Arezzo, republic of Florence [Italy]â€”died 1590, Milan) Florentine sculptor, goldsmith, and medalist who had a tumultuous, yet successful, career in Milan and was a sculptor for the Spanish court.
Leoni was the son of a stonemason, and he began his career as a goldsmith and medalist at the mint in Ferrara (Italy). He was excused from that position when he came under suspicion for counterfeiting. He moved to Rome in 1537 and was appointed as an engraver of the papal mint in 1538. Plagued by scandal and misfortune, in 1540 Leoni was saved from losing his right hand (as punishment for the attempted murder of papal jeweler Pellegrino di Leuti) and then from his sentence to galley slavery. He was released after a year with the help of acquaintances of great political influence, one of whom was naval commander Andrea Doria. In gratitude for his freedom, Leoni worked under Doria in Genoa and made several medals and sculptures in his likeness.
