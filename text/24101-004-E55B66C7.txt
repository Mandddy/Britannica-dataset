Old World fruit bat (family Pteropodidae), any of more than 180 species of large-eyed fruit-eating or flower-feeding bats widely distributed from Africa to Southeast Asia and Australia. Some species are solitary, some gregarious. Most roost in the open in trees, but some inhabit caves, rocks, or buildings.
Among the best-known pteropodids are the flying foxes (Pteropus), found on tropical islands from Madagascar to Australia and Indonesia. They are the largest of all bats. Some of the smallest members of the family are the pollen- and nectar-eating long-tongued fruit bats (Macroglossus), which attain a head and body length of about 6–7 cm (2.4–2.8 inches) and a wingspan of about 25 cm (10 inches). Colour varies among the pteropodids; some are red or yellow, some striped or spotted. With the exception of rousette bats (Rousettus), Old World fruit bats rely on vision rather than echolocation (animal “sonar”) as a means of avoiding obstacles.
