Ceratosaurus (genus Ceratosaurus), large carnivorous dinosaurs whose fossils date from the Late Jurassic Period (161 million to 146 million years ago) in North America and Africa.
Ceratosaurus lived at about the same time as Allosaurus and was similar in many general respects to that dinosaur, but the two were not closely related. Ceratosaurus belongs to a more primitive theropod stock that includes the coelophysids and abelisaurids. Although it weighed up to two tons, this dinosaur was slightly smaller than Allosaurus and bore a distinctive “horn” (actually an expanded nasal crest) on its snout and a row of bony plates down the middle of its back. Ceratosaurus also differed from allosaurs in that it retained remnants of a fourth clawed finger, unlike the three typical of most theropods.
