George Osborne, in full George Gideon Oliver Osborne  (born May 23, 1971, London, England) British Conservative Party politician who in 2010 became chancellor of the Exchequer in the cabinet of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Osborne was the son of Sir Peter Osborne, 17th baronet of Ballintaylor, a cofounder of the upmarket fabric and wallpaper designer Osborne &amp; Little. At age 13 he dropped his given name, Gideon, in favour of George (and added it officially to his name by deed poll), in what he subsequently described as a rare act of rebellion. Osborne was educated at St. Paul’s School, London, and Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1994 he joined the Conservative Research Department, which had served for many years as a kind of “nursery” for leading politicians. The following year he was appointed special adviser to Douglas Hogg, agriculture secretary in the then Conservative government.
