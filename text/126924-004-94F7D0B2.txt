Paul Poiret,  (born April 20, 1879, Paris, France—died  April 30, 1944, Paris) French couturier, the most fashionable dress designer of pre-World War I Paris. Poiret was particularly noted for his Neoclassical and Orientalist styles, for advocating the replacement of the corset with the brassiere, and for the introduction of the hobble skirt, a vertical, tight-bottomed style that confined women to mincing steps. “I freed the bust,” boasted Poiret, “and I shackled the legs.”
After serving as a designer in the house of Parisian fashion designer Charles Frederick Worth, Poiret opened a small shop in Paris in 1903. By 1907 he had been instrumental in reviving the Empire style, popular in France during the reign of Napoleon I. Inspired by a widespread interest in Eastern art and Russian ballet, he created flamboyant, theatrical designs. His evening gowns, turbans, and harem pants appeared in brilliant shades of purple, red, orange, green, and blue. He was extremely influential in the pre-World War I period, but his popularity waned in the 1920s.
