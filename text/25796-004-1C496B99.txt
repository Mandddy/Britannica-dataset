Antero Tarquínio de Quental,  (born April 18, 1842, Ponta Delgada, Azores, Port.—died  Sept. 11, 1891, Ponta Delgada) Portuguese poet who was a leader of the Generation of Coimbra, a group of young poets associated with the University of Coimbra in the 1860s who revolted against Romanticism and struggled to create a new outlook in literature and society.
He came from an aristocratic family that included writers and mystics, and Quental himself had mystical leanings that pervaded his poetry. Between 1858 and 1864, while studying law at Coimbra, he wrote his Romantic early poems, Raios de Extincta Luz (“Rays of Vanishing Light”) and the delicate lyrics published in 1872 as Primaveras Românticas (“Romantic Springtimes”). These were soon followed by Odes Modernas (1865), a volume of socially critical poetry that won him an intellectual and moral ascendancy among his fellow students. His pamphlet Bom-senso e Bom-gosto (1865; “Good Sense and Good Taste”), attacking the hidebound formalism of Portuguese literature, marked the opening of a war against the older literary generation that was waged until 1871, when a series of “democratic lectures,” organized by Quental and held in the Lisbon Casino, dealt the deathblow to Romanticism.
