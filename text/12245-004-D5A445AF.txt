Drapery,  depiction in drawing, painting, and sculpture of the folds of clothing. Techniques of rendering drapery clearly distinguish not only artistic periods and styles but the work of individual artists. The treatment of folds often has little to do with the nature of the actual material; its significance stems largely from the fact that it presents to the spectator the main mass of the clothed human figure.
In classical art the treatment of drapery varied between tightly meticulous and free-flowing lines. In the Hellenistic period the main emphasis was on volume rather than line.
