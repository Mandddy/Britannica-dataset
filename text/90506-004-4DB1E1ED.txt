Ridley Scott,  (born November 30, 1937, South Shields, Durham [now Tyne and Wear], England) British film director and producer whose films were acclaimed for their visual style and rich details.
Scott grew up in West Hartlepool, England, and attended the West Hartlepool College of Art and the Royal College of Art in London. After working as a set designer and director in British television, he began in 1967 to direct commercials, eventually numbering over 2,000, for his own company. His attention to visual stylization in his commercials, including distinctive atmospheric lighting effects, continued into the feature films that he began directing in 1977. His first was The Duellists, set in Napoleonic France, which won the best first-feature award at the Cannes film festival. His next three films were fantasies: Alien (1979), a science-fiction–horror story; Blade Runner (1982; recut 1992), a dystopian fable (based on a Philip K. Dick novel) notable for Scott’s vision of a grim, dark, polluted future; and Legend (1985), an allegorical fairy tale.
