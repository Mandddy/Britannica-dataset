Robert Morris Page,  (born June 2, 1903, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.—died May 15, 1992, Edina, Minnesota) American physicist known as the “father” of U.S. radar.
Page changed his major from theology to physics in his senior year at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. After graduating in 1927, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he joined the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and attended George Washington University (M.A., 1932). In 1934 he began work on developing pulse radar. In spite of its receiving low priority and limited support from the U.S. Navy administration, he successfully demonstrated a radar in 1936 and tested it at sea in 1937. By the time the United States entered World War II, there were 79 radars installed on various ships of the U.S. Navy. These radars, and those that followed, were credited with providing the U.S. Navy a significant advantage over the Japanese navy in the Pacific.
