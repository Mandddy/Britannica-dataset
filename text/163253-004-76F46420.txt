Sir Emery Walker,  (born April 2, 1851, London—died July 22, 1933, London) engraver and printer associated with the revival of fine printing in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Walker’s formal schooling ended when he was 13. From 1873 to 1883 he was employed by the Typographic Etching Company in London, whose founder had developed the first commercial application in England of photoengraving. During that decade Walker developed a profound understanding of the history and processes of printing. In 1886 he joined Walter Boutall in a partnership that was the beginning of a prominent engraving and printing firm.
