Stephen Sondheim, in full Stephen Joshua Sondheim  (born March 22, 1930, New York City, New York, U.S.) American composer and lyricist whose brilliance in matching words and music in dramatic situations broke new ground for Broadway musical theatre.
Precocious as a child, Sondheim showed an early musical aptitude among other wide-ranging interests. He studied piano and organ, and at age 15 he wrote a musical at George School in Bucks county, Pennsylvania. Under the tutelage of a family friend, Oscar Hammerstein II, he studied musical theatre. He also studied music at Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, and wrote college shows there. When he graduated in 1950, he received the Hutchinson Prize for composition, a fellowship. He then studied further in New York City with the composer Milton Babbitt.
