Shania Twain, original name Eilleen Regina Edwards  (born August 28, 1965, Windsor, Ontario, Canada) Canadian musician who, with her mix of country melodies and pop vocals, became one of the most popular crossover artists of the mid-1990s.
Twain took the surname of her stepfather, Jerry Twain, at a young age. After the family moved north to Timmins, Ontario, she developed an exceptional singing voice and by age eight was performing in clubs to help supplement her parentsâ€™ irregular income. During high school she sang with a Top 40 cover band called Longshot. At age 21 she moved to Toronto, where she worked during the day while singing in clubs at night. Less than a year later, however, her parents were killed in a traffic accident, and she returned home to raise her sister and two brothers.
