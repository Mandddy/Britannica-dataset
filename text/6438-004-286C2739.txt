George Bentham,  (born Sept. 22, 1800, Stoke, Devon, Eng.—died  Sept. 10, 1884, London) British botanist whose classification of seed plants (Spermatophyta), based on an exhaustive study of all known species, served as a foundation for modern systems of vascular plant taxonomy.
Impressed by the French naturalist Pyrame de Candolle’s analytic tables of French flora, Bentham began to study botany while managing his father’s estate near Montpellier, Fr., and serving as secretary (1826–32) to his uncle, the British philosopher and jurist Jeremy Bentham. In 1833, upon his inheritance of wealth following the deaths of his father and uncle, Bentham turned his full attention to botany.
