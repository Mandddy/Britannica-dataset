Giambologna, also called Giovanni da Bologna, or Jean Boulogne  (born 1529, Douai, Spanish Netherlands [now in France]—died  Aug. 13, 1608, Florence [Italy]) preeminent Mannerist sculptor in Italy during the last quarter of the 16th century.
First trained under Jacques Dubroeucq, a Flemish sculptor who worked in an Italianate style, Giambologna went to Rome about 1550, where his style was influenced by Hellenistic sculpture and the works of Michelangelo. Settling in Florence (1552), where he spent the rest of his life, he attracted the notice of Francesco de’ Medici, for whom many of his most important works were made. Among his earliest Florentine works were a bronze Bacchus, later placed on a fountain in the Borgo San Jacopo, and a bronze Venus, made for the Villa di Castello and now at the Villa Medicea della Petraia, near Florence.
