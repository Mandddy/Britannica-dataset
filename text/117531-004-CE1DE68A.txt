Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), popular game fish in the sunfish family, Centrarchidae (order Perciformes). It is one of the best-known sunfishes throughout its original range in the freshwater habitats of the central and southern United States. Bluegills have been introduced into numerous freshwater habitats throughout the western United States as well as in other parts of the world. Bluegills are also regionally known as blue sunfish, bluegill sunfish, copperheads, copperbellies, and bluegill bream.
Bluegills are one of the smallest popular food and game fishes, normally reaching lengths of only 15–23 cm (6–9 inches) and usually weighing less than 0.25 kg (0.5 pound). A dark spot at the rear of the dorsal fin and a dark flap at the rear of the gill cover are characteristic. The body colour of bluegills is variable but is basically bluish or greenish. Despite their small size, bluegills are highly spirited fighters when on the end of a fishing line and are among the most popular hook-and-line-caught fishes in North America. They are frequently stocked in small farm ponds.
