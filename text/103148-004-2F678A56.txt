HBO—as its full name, Home Box Office, implied—originally emphasized uncut and commercial-free movies, and from the very beginning cable subscribers paid extra for the channel. In 1975 it became the first American network to deliver its programming by satellite and thus became the first national cable channel. Rival cable channels arose, including Showtime, which was owned by the media company Viacom Inc.
