Dobsonfly, any of a group of insects in the subfamily Corydalinae (order Megaloptera) that are usually large and have four net-veined wings of similar size and shape. Dobsonflies are found in North and South America, Asia, Australia, and Africa. Nine genera of dobsonflies, containing several dozen species, are recognized. Together, they comprise four lineages: Protohermes, Neuromus, Corydalus, and Chloroniella.
Dobsonflies are characterized by a long cylindrical body with short legs. Males often possess well-developed mandibles, which in some species are used in fighting and defense. The larvae, sometimes known as hellgrammites or toe-biters, are aquatic and are eaten by fish, especially bass; they often are used as fish bait by anglers. Mature larvae migrate from their freshwater habitat to wet soil, moss, or decaying vegetation near the water to form pupal cells from which adults emerge. Megaloptera larvae are an important component of the macroinvertebrate fauna of streams and serve as biotic environmental indicators because of their high intolerance of water pollution.
