Roger Sherman,  (born April 19, 1721, Newton, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died July 23, 1793, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.) American politician whose plan for representation of large and small states prevented a deadlock at the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787.
After learning shoemaking, Sherman moved to Connecticut in 1743, joining a brother there two years after his father had died, and became surveyor of New Haven county. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1754. He held numerous public offices, serving several terms in the Connecticut legislature between 1755 and 1766. In 1755 he became a justice of the peace in Litchfield county, and he eventually rose to serve as a judge of the superior court, a post he held into the 1780s. Although a staunch conservative, he was an early supporter of American independence from Britain. As a delegate to the Second Continental Congress at Philadelphia, he signed the Declaration of Independence (1776) and helped draft the Articles of Confederation. From 1777 to 1779 he served on Connecticut’s council of safety, and in 1784 he was elected mayor of New Haven.
