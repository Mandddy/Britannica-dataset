In the 4th century bce (when it was known as Daliang), it became the capital of the Wei state; the Wei also built the first of many canals there, the Langtang Canal, joining the Huang He to the Qin River, flowing into northern Shandong province. At the end of the 3rd century bce, however, Daliang was laid waste by the forces of the Qin dynasty (221–207 bce), and, until the 5th century ce, Kaifeng was only a medium-sized market town. At the end of the 5th century, under the Bei (Northern) Wei dynasty (386–534/535), it became the seat of a commandery, and, in the 6th century, it became Bianzhou prefecture.
