Circuit breaker, automatic switch in an electric circuit. Its function is similar to that of a fuse—to open the circuit if abnormal current conditions occur, usually overloads—but it is not destroyed in operation and can be closed again. The simplest circuit breakers are operated by a solenoid that is activated by an excessive increase in current flow. Small circuit breakers are widely used in place of fuses to protect electrical systems in homes.
