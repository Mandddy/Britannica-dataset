Howard Stern,  (born January 12, 1954, Roosevelt, New York, U.S.) American radio show host known for his controversial broadcasts.
Stern was introduced to radio by his father, a sound engineer. The younger Stern, an awkward and shy child, found an outlet in the medium and began producing his own show on a tape recorder. As a student at Boston University, he worked at the school’s radio station; he graduated in 1976 with a degree in communications. After a series of unmemorable on-the-air jobs in Hartford, Connecticut, and Detroit, Michigan, he landed in Washington, D.C., where he teamed with Robin Quivers, who became his sidekick, and developed a highly popular format. With its mix of Stern’s self-deprecating jokes; provocative interviews with lesbians; commentary on sex, celebrities, and bodily functions; and in-studio visits by naked women, the radio program became number one in the D.C. area. In 1982, however, the duo were fired following a dispute with station management, and they subsequently signed on with WNBC-AM in New York City. Though Stern produced another top-rated show, continuous arguments over program content led to his dismissal.
