Pipe snake, any primitive burrowing snake characterized by remnants of a pelvic girdle and belonging to the genera Cylindrophis, Anilius, or Anomochilus. Each genus represents a distinct family: the Cylindrophiidae, Aniliidae, and Anomochilidae, respectively. All are small to moderately sized snakes with smooth glossy scales and a small head that is indistinct from the neck. They are harmless nocturnal animals that burrow in mud and loose soil.
Ten species of Asian pipe snakes, Cylindrophis, exist. They inhabit Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia. Asian pipe snakes are relatively small, reaching lengths of 0.3–0.9 metre (1–3 feet), with a cosmopolitan appetite. They feed upon invertebrates and vertebrates, and their diet also includes other snakes, which they subdue with their powerful jaws. Asian pipe snakes are live-bearing and produce 1–15 young at a time. When the snake is molested, the head is buried beneath its coiled body and the tail is raised; the tail, which is brightly coloured and resembles a head, often startles a potential predator.
