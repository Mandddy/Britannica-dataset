Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck,  (born April 1562, Amsterdamâ€”died  Oct. 16, 1621, Amsterdam) Dutch organist and composer, one of the principal figures in the development of organ music before J.S. Bach.
Sweelinck succeeded his father as organist of the Oude Kerk (Old Church), Amsterdam, in about 1580 and remained in this post until his death. Apparently he never left the Low Countries and traveled only to Rotterdam and Antwerp.
