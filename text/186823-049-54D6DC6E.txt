Paul Davies, in full Paul Charles William Davies  (born April 22, 1946, London, England) British theoretical physicist and astrobiologist who contributed to scholarly and popular debate on issues such as the origin of life and extraterrestrial intelligence through his books and television specials.
Davies graduated from University College, London, in 1967 with a bachelor’s degree and remained to earn a doctorate in theoretical physics. Upon graduation in 1970 he worked as a research fellow at the University of Cambridge and two years later accepted a position at King’s College, London, as a lecturer in applied mathematics. Davies became interested in quantum field theory and curved space-time and focused much of his research in that area. He published The Physics of Time Asymmetry, the first of numerous books directed to his professional colleagues and the general public, in 1974. Davies then joined physicists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, who were researching the thermodynamic properties of black holes.
