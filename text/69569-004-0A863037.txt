Garry Shandling, in full Garry Emmanuel Shandling  (born November 29, 1949, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died March 24, 2016, Los Angeles, California) American actor, writer, and comedian who often incorporated his real life into his work, both as a stand-up comic and as the creator and star of the television series It’s Garry Shandling’s Show (1986–90) and The Larry Sanders Show (1992–98).
Shandling grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and later earned a degree in marketing from the University of Arizona. In the early 1970s he moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote (1975–76) for the TV series Sanford and Son and Welcome Back, Kotter. Frustrated by the situation comedies’ formulaic writing, he began doing stand-up comedy that featured his whining self-deprecation and self-absorption. Shandling made his television stand-up debut on The Tonight Show in 1981, and by 1983 he was a frequent guest host and considered a possible successor to regular host Johnny Carson. In 1986 It’s Garry Shandling’s Show debuted. The innovative and subversive series starred Shandling as a character named Garry Shandling who knew he was on a television sitcom and often broke the “fourth wall,” addressing the audience while he strolled from one set to another. The show ran until 1990.
