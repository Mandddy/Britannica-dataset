BCG vaccine,  vaccine against tuberculosis. The BCG vaccine is prepared from a weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis, a bacteria closely related to M. tuberculosis, which causes the disease. The vaccine was developed over a period of 13 years, from 1908 to 1921, by French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin, who named the product Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, or BCG. The vaccine is administered shortly after birth only in infants at high risk of tuberculosis. BCG vaccine produces an immune response that partly protects infants and young children from serious forms of tuberculosis. Because of the risk of infection and variability in protection associated with the vaccine, it is used only in countries where the prevalence of tuberculosis is high.
For a variable number of years after BCG vaccination, many people show a local skin reaction to the purified protein derived skin test (also called tuberculin skin test). Further testing for tuberculosis is often required in individuals given BCG vaccination in order to distinguish between a false-positive test result, in which an individual is not infected with tuberculosis, and a positive test result, in which an individual is infected with tuberculosis.
