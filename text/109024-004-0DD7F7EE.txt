Bill T. Jones, byname of William Tass Jones  (born February 15, 1952, Steuben county, New York, U.S.) American choreographer and dancer who, with Arnie Zane, created the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company.
Jones was the 9th of 12 children of migrant farmworkers. His parents moved from rural Florida when he was three years old, and he grew up in Wayland, New York, just south of Rochester. He attended the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he became interested in movement and dance. There he met Arnie Zane, who became his partner in business and in life. With Lois Welk and Jill Becker, the two men formed the American Dance Asylum in 1973 and started choreographing works that tested the boundaries of modern dance. They scandalized some audiences by partnering male dancers, and they addressed subjects such as racism and AIDS. Much of their work incorporated multimedia elements such as spoken narrative and videotape, and they examined through movement autobiographical elements of their lives.
