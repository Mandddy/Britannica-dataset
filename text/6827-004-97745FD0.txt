Braxton Bragg,  (born March 22, 1817, Warrenton, N.C., U.S.—died  Sept. 27, 1876, Galveston, Texas) Confederate officer in the U.S. Civil War (1861–65) whose successes in the West were dissipated when he failed to follow up on them.
After graduating in 1837 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., Bragg served in the Seminole Wars and the Mexican War (1846–48). As a major general in the Confederate Army, he commanded a corps at Shiloh (April 1862) and, upon the death of Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston in that battle, was promoted to full general’s rank. In the autumn of that year, having succeeded Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard in the command of the Army of Tennessee, Bragg led a bold advance from eastern Tennessee across Kentucky to Louisville. Tactically, the ensuing Battle of Perryville (October) was a draw; unwilling to fight to a decision, Bragg withdrew into Tennessee. Though he was bitterly censured, the personal favour of Confederate Pres. Jefferson Davis kept him at the head of the Army of Tennessee, and in December–January 1862–63 he fought the indecisive Battle of Stones River (Murfreesboro) against Gen. William Starke Rosecrans. The following September he inflicted a crushing defeat on Rosecrans at Chickamauga and for a time besieged the Union forces at Chattanooga. But large Federal reinforcements were concentrated upon the threatened spot under Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, and the great Battle of Chattanooga (November) ended in the rout of Bragg’s army. Bragg was then relieved of his command, but President Davis made him his military adviser. After the war he was a civil engineer in Alabama and Texas.
