Carrie Underwood, in full Carrie Marie Underwood  (born March 10, 1983, Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.) American country music performer who parlayed her victory in the American television singing competition American Idol into a successful recording career.
Underwood grew up in Oklahoma, on her family’s farm in Checotah. She started singing at a young age, initially at church and later in school plays and talent shows. In 2002 she entered Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, with intentions to pursue a career in broadcast journalism. Two years later she interrupted her studies to audition for the fourth season of American Idol. Underwood made the cut and ultimately won the competition in 2005 after being chosen as the favourite by viewers. She received the top prize of a recording contract with 19 Recordings/Arista Records, and the resulting album, Some Hearts (2005), was a massive commercial hit, eventually selling more than seven million copies and cementing Underwood’s status as one of American Idol’s most successful alumni. She supported the album with a 150-show tour in 2006, sharing bills with Kenny Chesney and Brad Paisley in addition to headlining her own dates. Underwood made time to return to school, however, and that same year she graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in mass communications from Northeastern State University. In 2007 she won Grammy Awards for best new artist and best female country vocal performance.
