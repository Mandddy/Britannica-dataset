Hargobind,  (born 1595, Wadali, India—died  1644, Kiratpur, near the Himalayas) sixth Sikh Guru, who developed a strong Sikh army and gave the Sikh religion its military character, in accord with the instructions of his father, Guru Arjan (1563–1606), the first Sikh martyr, who had been executed on the order of the Mughal emperor Jahāngīr.
Up to the time of Hargobind, the Sikh religion had been passive. At his succession ceremony Hargobind is believed to have defiantly borne two swords, symbolizing his twin authority as temporal (miri) and spiritual (piri) head of the community. He also devoted much time to military training and the martial arts, becoming an expert swordsman, wrestler, and rider. Despite opposition, Hargobind built up his army and fortified his cities. In 1609 he built at Amritsar the Akal Takht (“Throne of God”), a temple and assembly hall combined, where both spiritual and temporal matters pertaining to the Sikh nation could be resolved. He built a fort near Amritsar and named it Lohgarh. Deftly he instilled the will to fight and established high morale in his followers. The Mughal emperor Jahāngīr viewed the buildup of Sikh power as a threat and had Guru Hargobind jailed in the fortress of Gwalior. For 12 years Guru Hargobind remained a prisoner, but Sikh devotion to him only intensified. Finally, the emperor, apparently seeking the favour of the Sikhs as possible allies against the Indian states still defying Mughal rule, relented and set the Guru free. Hargobind followed his former militant course, recognizing that a clash with Mughal power was coming.
