Elapid, any of about 300 venomous species of the snake family Elapidae, characterized by short fangs fixed in the front of the upper jaw. Terrestrial elapids generally resemble the more abundant colubrids, whereas aquatic elapids may possess paddle-shaped tails and other structures adapted to marine environments. Most species lay eggs; a few, chiefly in Australia, bear living young.
Elapids tend to be slender and agile. Most are small and inoffensive to humans, but the family also contains some of the largest and most lethal of snakes. An elapid strikes with a downward stab, followed by chewing. The venom is primarily neurotoxic but often contains substances that damage the body tissues or blood cells. The bite is relatively painless, but death from paralysis of the heart and lungs may be swift. Elapids occur in America, Africa, southern Asia, Pacific Islands, and Australia. About 60 species of elapids live in Australia.
