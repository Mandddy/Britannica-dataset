Whaleboat,  light, swift, rowing and sailing boat fitted with a centreboard (retractable keel), initially developed for use by whaling crews and now used more generally. Its double-ended, broad-beamed design is reminiscent of the old Viking boats; in time carvel-constructed whaleboats superseded clinker-built (lapstrake) vessels. The whaleboat’s superior handling characteristics soon made it a popular general-purpose ship’s boat, and it now often serves as a cutter or gig.
