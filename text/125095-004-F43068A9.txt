Constantius II, original name Flavius Julius Constantius   (born Aug. 7, 317, Sirmium, Savia [now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia]—died Nov. 3, 361, Mopsucrenae, Honorias [now in Turkey]) Roman emperor from ad 337 to 361, who at first shared power with his two brothers, Constantine II (d. 340) and Constans I (d. 350), but who was sole ruler from 353 to 361.
The third son of Constantine I the Great and Fausta, Constantius served under his father as caesar from Nov. 8, 324, to Sept. 9, 337. When Constantine died on May 22, 337, the troops massacred many of his relatives, including Constantine’s half-brother, Constantius, consul in 335 and father of the future emperor Julian. In Julian’s Letter to the Athenians (361) he openly accuses Constantius of murdering his father. The historian Eutropius felt the new emperor had “permitted but not ordered” the killings. Constantius then divided the empire with his brothers, taking the eastern provinces (Thrace, Macedonia, Greece, Asia, and Egypt) for himself. Between 338 and 350 he was engaged in inconclusive but extremely bloody warfare with the Persian king Shāpūr II.
