 Steve Earle, in full Stephen Fain Earle  (born Jan. 17, 1955, Fort Monroe, Va., U.S.) American singer, songwriter, and guitarist who bridged the genres of rock and country music.
As a child growing up in Texas, Earle acquired his first guitar at age 11 and was playing proficiently two years later. Although he showed musical promise, Earle was often in trouble with the law and was disliked by local country music fans because of his long hair and precocious anti-Vietnam War stance. He left home as a teenager to live with an uncle in Houston and dropped out of high school. Making his way to Nashville, Tenn., Earle sought to establish himself as a songwriter. In the process he forged friendships with a pair of his musical idols, Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt, country music “outlaws” of long standing. Earle’s debut album as a performer, Guitar Town (1986), won praise from critics and was a commercial success, with both its title track and “Goodbye’s All We Got Left” reaching the Top Ten on the country music chart.
