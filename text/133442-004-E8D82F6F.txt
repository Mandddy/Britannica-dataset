Edward Henry Carson, Baron Carson, in full Edward Henry Carson, Baron Carson of Duncairn  (born Feb. 9, 1854, Dublin, Ire.—died Oct. 22, 1935, Minster, Kent, Eng.) lawyer and politician, known as the “uncrowned king of Ulster,” who successfully led Ulster unionist resistance to the British government’s attempts to introduce Home Rule for the whole of Ireland.
Although Carson was to become the champion of the northern province, he was born into a Protestant family in southern Ireland and was reared and educated there. Early in his Irish legal career (from 1877), he came to mistrust the Irish nationalists. As senior crown prosecutor, he sternly enforced the Crimes Act of 1887, securing numerous convictions for violence against Irish estates owned by English absentee landlords. He was appointed Irish solicitor general and elected to the British House of Commons in 1892, was called to the English bar in 1893, and served as British solicitor general from 1900 to 1905. During these years Carson achieved his greatest success as a barrister. In 1895 his cross-examination of Oscar Wilde largely secured the Irish writer’s conviction for homosexuality.
