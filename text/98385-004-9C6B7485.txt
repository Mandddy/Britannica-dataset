Squash tennis,  racket game resembling squash rackets played by two people only in a four-walled court using a lively inflated ball that bounces very fast and is the size of a tennis ball. The game requires great speed in anticipation and turning.
Squash tennis is played in the same court as squash rackets. There are minor differences in the line markings, such as the “out” line on the back wall being two feet lower than for squash rackets. Players use a lawn tennis racket, an inch shorter in the handle, and a green, pressurized ball, similar to but slightly smaller than the tennis ball. Scoring is the same as in American squash rackets. Points were scored only by the server until a change made in 1954 allowed hand-out to score as well.
