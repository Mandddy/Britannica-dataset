Wagon, four-wheeled vehicle designed to be drawn by draft animals and known to have been used as early as the 1st century bc, incorporating such earlier innovations as the spoked wheel and metal wheel rim. Early examples also had such features as pivoted front axles and linchpins to secure the wheels. In its essential form, therefore, the wagon has been in common use for about 2,000 years.
During the 9th century several additional improvements in harness and suspension led to a marked preference for wagons over carts as a means of passenger and long-distance transportation. Wagons were heavier than carts in construction, with a boxlike body that was useful for hauling freight and agricultural produce and a smoother ride due to the inherent stability of being supported on four wheels rather than two. Wagons were produced in many sizes and types, and those used for the carrying of passengers were equipped with springs between the box and the running gear. The coach variation was a later innovation, becoming a distinct form in the 16th century. One type of wagon, the Conestoga, became famous as a freight wagon during the 18th century, and its descendant, the prairie schooner, was the most common vehicle used by settlers in the opening of the American West.
