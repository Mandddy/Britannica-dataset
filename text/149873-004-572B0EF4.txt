Aerosol, a system of liquid or solid particles uniformly distributed in a finely divided state through a gas, usually air. Aerosol particles, such as dust, play an important role in the precipitation process, providing the nuclei upon which condensation and freezing take place. They affect climate by reflecting or absorbing incoming solar radiation and enhancing the brightness, and thus reflectivity, of clouds. They also participate in chemical processes and influence the electrical properties of the atmosphere.
True aerosol particles range in diameter from a few millimicrometres to about 1 micrometre (equal to 10-4 cm). When smaller particles are in suspension, the system begins to acquire the properties of a true solution; for larger particles, the settling rate is usually so rapid that the system cannot properly be called a true aerosol. Nevertheless, the term is commonly employed, especially in the case of fog or cloud droplets and dust particles, which can have diameters of over 100 micrometres.
