Harold Lloyd,  (born April 20, 1893, Burchard, Neb., U.S.—died March 8, 1971, Hollywood, Calif.) U.S. motion-picture comedian who was the highest paid star of the 1920s and one of the cinema’s most popular personalities.
The son of an itinerant commercial photographer, Lloyd finally settled in San Diego, Calif., where in 1913 he started playing minor parts in one-reel comedies. He mastered the art of the comic chase in the short time he was a member of Mack Sennett’s Keystone comedy troupe. In 1915 Lloyd joined the new acting company formed by Hal Roach, a former actor who had turned producer. During this period he experimented with a comic character, the bewhiskered Willie Work. The most consistently successful of his early films, however, were those of the Lonesome Luke series. Beginning with Just Nuts (1915), Luke quickly became a popular U.S. screen character.
