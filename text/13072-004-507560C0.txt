Carcharhinid, also called requiem shark,   any member of the shark family Carcharhinidae, which includes about 12 genera and 50 species found worldwide. Carcharhinids are found primarily in warm and temperate ocean waters, though a few species inhabit fresh or brackish water. The Carcharhinidae is one of the largest families of sharks, and some of the larger carcharhinids, such as the blacktip, whitetip, bull shark, and lemon sharks, are potentially dangerous to humans.
Carcharhinids are typically sharklike in appearance, having two dorsal fins, an elongate upper tail lobe, and single-cusped, blade-shaped teeth. Like other sharks, they are carnivorous, preying on fishes and various other animals. The species range in length from about 1.5 to 5.5 m (4.5 to 18 feet). The classification of many, especially the gray sharks, or whalers (Carcharhinus), is uncertain and may be revised after further study.
