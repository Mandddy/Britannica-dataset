Benjamin Robert Haydon,  (born Jan. 25, 1786, Plymouth, Devon, Eng.—died  June 22, 1846, London) English historical painter and writer, whose Autobiography has proved more enduring than his painting.
The son of a Plymouth bookseller, Haydon went to London to attend the Royal Academy schools. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1807, but because of subsequent quarrels most of his later paintings were shown at private exhibitions. Haydon’s ambition was to become the greatest historical painter England had ever known, and he went on to produce a series of stiffly heroic canvases on such biblical and classical subjects as “The Death of Dentatus” (1809), “The Judgment of Solomon” (1814), “Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem” (1820), and “The Raising of Lazarus” (1823). His depictions of the contemporary English scene in “Mock Election” (1827) and “Punch or May Day” (1829) show flashes of humour, however, and his portrait of “Wordsworth” (1842; National Portrait Gallery, London) is an incisive character study.
