Bar Mitzvah, also spelled Bar Mitzva, or Mitzwa (Hebrew: “Son of the Commandment”), plural Bar Mitzvahs, Bar Mitzvot, or Bar Mitzwot,  Jewish religious ritual and family celebration commemorating the religious adulthood of a boy on his 13th birthday. The boy, now deemed personally responsible for fulfilling all the commandments, may henceforth don phylacteries (religious symbols worn on the forehead and left arm) during the weekday-morning prayers and may be counted an adult whenever 10 male adults are needed to form a quorum (minyan) for public prayers.
In a public act of acknowledging religious majority, the boy is called up during the religious service to read from the Torah. This event may take place on any occasion following the 13th birthday at which the Torah is read but generally occurs on the sabbath. The liturgy of the day thus permits the boy to read the weekly text from the prophets, called Hafṭarah. This is sometimes followed by a hortatory discourse. After the religious ceremony, there is often a festive Kiddush, or prayer over a cup of wine, with a family social dinner or banquet on the same or the following day.
