Yamuna River, also called Jumna,  major river of northern India, primarily in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh states. It is one of the countryâ€™s most-sacred rivers.
The Yamuna rises on the slopes of the Bandarpunch massif in the Great Himalayas near Yamnotri (Jamnotri) in western Uttarakhand. It flows in a southerly direction swiftly through the Himalayan foothills and, exiting Uttarakhand, onto the Indo-Gangetic Plain, along the border between Uttar Pradesh and Haryana state to the west. The Eastern and Western Yamuna canals are fed from the river at that point.
