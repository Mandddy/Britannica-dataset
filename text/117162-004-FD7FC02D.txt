Sima Guang, Wade-Giles romanization Ssu-ma Kuang   (born November 17, 1019, Guangzhou [now Guangshan, Henan province], China—died 1086, Kaifeng, Henan) scholar, statesman, and poet who compiled the monumental Zizhi tongjian (“Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government”), a general chronicle of Chinese history from 403 bce to 959 ce, considered one of the finest single historical works in Chinese. Known for his moral uprightness, he was learned in several disciplines and prominent in government.
Sima Guang studied the Confucian Classics and, after passing the civil-service examinations, rose rapidly to high office. Between 1069 and 1085 he led the faction opposing the radical reforms of the innovator Wang Anshi. Conservative in his interpretation of the Confucian Classics, Sima argued for the cause of good government through moral leadership rather than by assertive measures and through the improved functioning of tested institutions rather than by drastic changes. Shortly before his death he finally succeeded in dislodging Wang’s faction from the government and became the leading minister in a government that attempted to repeal most of Wang’s reforms. Until recent times most historians tended to view Sima favourably and Wang from an opposite viewpoint, but recent historical work has shown that Sima’s program of antireform measures was not greatly successful.
