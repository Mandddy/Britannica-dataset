Hackney,  any carriage plying for hire, although hackney coach usually refers to a four-wheeled carriage drawn by two horses and holding six passengers. Hackneys were introduced into England early in the 17th century and may have been named for a section of London. In 1654 there were 300 licensed hackney coaches allowed in London and its environs, and by 1832 there were about 1,200.
Hackneys were also in use in the United States in the 18th century. In France, a coach for hire, the fiacre, was introduced in Paris in the 1640s.
