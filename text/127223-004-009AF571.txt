Jimmie Johnson, in full Jimmie Kenneth Johnson  (born September 17, 1975, El Cajon, California, U.S.) American race-car driver who won six National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) championships and was the first driver to win the title in five consecutive years (2006–10).
Johnson, who started competing in motor sports at age five, won his first championship in motorcycle racing at eight years old. Eventually he turned to four-wheel vehicles and took up offroad racing, competing in leagues that included Short-Course Off-Road Drivers Association, SCORE International, and Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group. He won six championships and was named Rookie of the Year in each of those leagues before moving on to the American Speed Association, where he took Rookie of the Year honours in 1998. That same year, he began to race in NASCAR’s Busch Series and by 2000 was a member of Herzog Motorsports’ Busch team, finishing third in that season’s Rookie of the Year standings. When Herzog Motorsports lost its sponsor in 2000, Johnson was recommended to Hendrick Motorsports by NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon.
