Fitzroy River, river in northern Western Australia. It rises in the Durack Range in east Kimberley and traces a 325-mile (525-kilometre) course that flows southwest through the rugged King Leopold Ranges and the Geikie Gorge (where many freshwater crocodiles are found) and turns northwest through rugged country and plains, emptying into the Indian Ocean at King Sound. A tidal rise of 25 feet (8 m) is common at its mouth, which is 6 miles (10 km) wide. Its chief tributaries are the Hann and Margaret rivers and Christmas Creek. The Fitzroy traverses cattle and sheep country, and rice is grown on floodplains along its lower course. A dam at Camballin controls water for irrigation. There is little navigation because of sandbars and snags. Fitzroy Crossing, a settlement on the upper river, is in an area of large, permanent waterholes that sustain wildlife. Just above it is the Geikie Gorge National Park. The river was explored in 1838 by Lieut. John Lort Stokes of the HMS “Beagle,” who named it in honour of Capt. Robert Fitzroy, a former commander of the ship.
