Fordham University was founded in 1841 by Bishop (later Archbishop) John Hughes. It was originally an all-male undergraduate college in the Bronx and was known as St. John’s College. The School of Law was added in 1905 and moved to Manhattan in 1906. In 1907 the university’s present name was adopted. Thomas More College, a Fordham-founded college for women, opened in 1964 and merged with the university 10 years later.
