Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), perennial freshwater plant native to Eurasia but now common throughout the north temperate zone as a weed. Butomus umbellatus is the only species of the family Butomaceae (order Alismatales).
Flowering rushes can grow fully submerged but are most commonly found emerging from the water. Emerging plants have long tapering leaves that can extend to a height of about 1 metre (39 inches) from the base of the plant and are triangular in cross section. The rose-coloured flowers, found only above water, are arranged on umbels (flat or rounded flower clusters) and have three sepals (modified leaves) and three petals. While the flowers can produce dry fruits, prolific bulblets readily break off from the root system and are the primary means reproduction for some populations.
