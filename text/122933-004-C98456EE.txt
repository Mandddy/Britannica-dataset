Gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), also called Waller’s gazelle,  the longest-necked member of the gazelle tribe (Antilopini, family Bovidae), a browsing antelope of the lowland arid thornbush of the Horn of Africa.
The gerenuk’s shoulder height is 80–105 cm (31–41 inches), and the animal weighs 28–52 kg (62–114 pounds). It has a two-tone coloration, buff with a reddish brown saddle. Its underparts, rump patch, tail, throat patch, chin, eye rings, and lips are all white, as are the insides of its very large ears. Only the males have horns, which are S-shaped, heavily annulated, and 32–44 cm (13–17 inches) long. The elongated limbs and neck (gerenuk means “giraffe-necked” in Somali) and the pointed snout are adapted to selective nibbling of small leaves on thorny shrubs and trees—including foliage too high for other antelopes, which the gerenuk reaches by standing on its hind legs. Modified lumbar vertebrae, powerful hind legs, and wedge-shaped hooves make the gerenuk the only antelope that can stand unsupported in this manner. Its diet thus enriched with moisture, the gerenuk is able to exploit resources inaccessible to water-dependent herbivores. Indeed, its population density can actually increase with distance from permanent water. Degradation of grassland due to drought and overgrazing by domestic livestock has caused the thornbush to expand, which creates more habitat for the gerenuk and compensates to some extent for clearing, cultivation, and overhunting in other parts of its range. It prefers well-spaced bushes and trees and avoids dense bush with restricted passage.
