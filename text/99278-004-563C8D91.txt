Art Hodes,  (born Nov. 14, 1904, Nikoliev, Russia—died March 4, 1993, Harvey, Ill., U.S.)  American jazz and blues pianist known for the emotional commitment of his playing. He is regarded by many critics as the greatest white blues pianist, and he was also a noted jazz writer, historian, and teacher.
Hodes’s Ukrainian family came to the United States in 1905 and moved to Chicago when he was a child. He began his musical education in 1916 at Jane Addams’s Hull House, where he often jammed with Benny Goodman and other jazz notables. Throughout the 1920s, Hodes learned from the many greats of jazz who were then in Chicago, including Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and King Oliver. He became pianist with the Wolverines in 1926 after the departure of leader Bix Beiderbecke, and he played in the Chicago area throughout most of the 1930s with such musicians as Gene Krupa, Frank Teschemacher, and Bud Freeman. He did not become well known, however, until he moved to New York in 1938 and made some noted recordings with Joe Marsala and Mezz Mezzrow. From 1940 Hodes led many highly regarded small groups, specializing in traditional jazz and blues.
