Indus civilization, also called Indus valley civilization or Harappan civilization,  the earliest known urban culture of the Indian subcontinent. The nuclear dates of the civilization appear to be about 2500â€“1700 bce, though the southern sites may have lasted later into the 2nd millennium bce.
The civilization was first identified in 1921 at Harappa in the Punjab region and then in 1922 at Mohenjo-daro (Mohenjodaro), near the Indus River in the Sindh (Sind) region. Both sites are in present-day Pakistan, in Punjab and Sindh provinces, respectively. The ruins of Mohenjo-daro were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1980.
