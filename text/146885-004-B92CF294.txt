Mayonnaise, cold sauce originating in French cuisine, an emulsion of raw egg yolks and vegetable oil. As the yolks are continuously beaten, oil is added little by little until a thick cream results. Plain mayonnaise is flavoured with lemon juice, mustard, or vinegar.
This rich, mild sauce serves as the base of dozens of variations such as mayonnaise verte (with puréed green herbs), sauce rémoulade (with anchovies, pickles, and capers), sauce aïoli (a Provençal mayonnaise flavoured with a great deal of garlic), and salad dressings such as Thousand Island and Russian dressings.
