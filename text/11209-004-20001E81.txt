Harness racing, sport of driving at speed a Standardbred horse pulling a light two-wheeled vehicle called a sulky. Harness racing horses are of two kinds, differentiated by gait: the pacing horse, or pacer, moves both legs on one side of its body at the same time; the trotting horse, or trotter, strides with its left front and right rear leg moving forward simultaneously, then right front and left rear together. Harness racing is one of the two main kinds of horse racing; the other involves horse racing astride in a saddle. For the latter, see horse racing.
Early records of the antecedents of harness racing are ancient. Assyrian kings of 1500 bc maintained elaborate stables, and professional trainers for horses used to draw chariots, originally used in war but soon also used in the sport of hunting. Homerâ€™s account of the chariot race in the Iliad is later. There were four-horse hitch chariot races in the Olympic Games of the 7th century bc and races with two-horse hitches earlier. Horses were locally bred with others from Asia Minor and northern Africa.
