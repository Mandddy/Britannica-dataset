Deion Sanders, in full Deion Luwynn Sanders, bynames Prime Time and Neon Deion  (born August 9, 1967, Fort Myers, Florida, U.S.) American gridiron football player and baseball player who is the only person to have played in both a Super Bowl and a World Series. Known for his flashy personality and outspokenness, Sanders was a middling professional baseball player but is widely considered the best man-to-man cover cornerback in National Football League (NFL) history.
Sanders was a multisport star in high school and earned a scholarship to Florida State University, where he was a member of the schoolâ€™s football, baseball, and track teams. He first brought his brash attitude to national attention as a two-time All-American in football. Sanders quickly became a sports media favourite, and his tremendous on-field achievements were sometimes overshadowed by his braggadocio, his penchant for gaudy jewelry, and his self-promotion, which included his tuxedo-attired arrival in a white stretch limousine at a 1988 game against the rival University of Florida. NFL teams were not put off by his cocky persona, however, and Sanders was selected by the Atlanta Falcons with the fifth selection of the 1989 NFL draft.
