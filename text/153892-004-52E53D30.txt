Georgian Bay Islands National Park, national park consisting of picturesque islands and a small mainland area, south-central Ontario, Canada, northwest of Toronto. Established in 1929, the park, divided into two sections, with a total land area of 51/2 square miles (14 square km), consists of some 40 islands or parts of islands, one group being located at the southeastern end of Georgian Bay, the other in the western part of the bay, where the Main Channel connects it with Lake Huron. Largest is Beausoleil Island (4 square miles), once the home of Chippewa Indians. Another, Flowerpot Island, is named for two giant flowerpot-shaped pillars that were sculptured from limestone cliffs by the waves. The parkâ€™s landscape is varied and includes glacier-scraped rocks and some dense forests. White-tailed deer, smaller mammals, and numerous songbirds thrive in the area.
