Victor Fleming,  (born February 23, 1883, Pasadena, California, U.S.—died January 6, 1949, near Cottonwood, Arizona) American filmmaker who was one of Hollywood’s most popular directors during the 1930s, best known for his work on the 1939 classics Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz.
Fleming started in the film industry as a stunt car driver in 1910. A year later he began working for Allan Dwan at the American Film Manufacturing Company, and by 1915 he was handling the camera for D.W. Griffith. During World War I he served as a photographer for the U.S. Army. Fleming’s first feature film, When the Clouds Roll By (1919), starred Douglas Fairbanks, and he directed several more movies before signing a contract with Paramount in 1922. Among the many prestigious silents he helmed were The Way of All Flesh (1927) with Emil Jannings, Hula (1927) with Clara Bow, and Abie’s Irish Rose (1928), an adaptation of the long-running Broadway show. In 1929 Fleming directed Gary Cooper in two westerns, The Wolf Song and The Virginian, an adaptation of Owen Wister’s popular novel. Although the latter was filmed several times, Fleming’s early talkie remains definitive, thanks to Cooper’s star-making turn as a charismatic ranch foreman and Walter Huston’s portrayal of a cattle rustler.
