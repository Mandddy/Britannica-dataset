John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, 1st Baron Acton, in full John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, 1st Baron Acton of Aldenham, 8th Baronet  (born January 10, 1834, Naples [Italy]—died June 19, 1902, Tegernsee, Bavaria, Germany) English Liberal historian and moralist, the first great modern philosopher of resistance to the state, whether its form be authoritarian, democratic, or socialist. A comment that he wrote in a letter, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,” today has become a familiar aphorism. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1837, and he was raised to the peerage in 1869.
Acton was the only son of Sir Ferdinand Richard Edward Acton (1801–37) by his marriage to Marie Louise Pelline von Dalberg, heiress to a very respectable German title. In 1840 his widowed mother married Lord Leveson, the future Lord Granville and Liberal foreign secretary, an alliance that brought Acton early into the intimate circle of the great Whigs. Educated at Oscott College, Warwickshire, he went to Munich to study under the Catholic church historian Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger, who grounded him in the new German methods of historical research.
