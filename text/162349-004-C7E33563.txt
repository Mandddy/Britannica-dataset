Winsor McCay,  (born September 26, 1867? [see Researcher’s Note], Ontario, Canada?—died July 26, 1934, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American newspaper cartoonist who was also a pioneer of animated films.
At age 21, McCay started working as a poster and billboard artist for a Chicago company. In 1904, after working as an illustrator and cartoonist for various newspapers in Chicago, in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in New York City, he created two successful comic strips, Little Sammy Sneeze and Dream of the Rarebit Fiend. The following year McCay debuted his most renowned creation, the strip Little Nemo in Slumberland. Regarded as a masterpiece of comic-strip art, Little Nemo was a largely plotless strip that featured the surrealistic dreams of its young protagonist, rendered in painstaking detail by McCay. In 1909 McCay performed in a successful vaudeville act that featured him “speed drawing” his own cartoon characters, as well as caricatures of noted personalities. Inspired by the work of Emile Cohl and J. Stuart Blackton, McCay began to experiment with animated cartoons and produced an animated version of Little Nemo that proved a great hit in his stage act.
