Antoine Rivaroli, count de Rivarol,  (born June 26, 1753, Bagnols-sur-Cèze, Fr.—died  April 11, 1801, Berlin [Germany]) French publicist, journalist, and epigrammatist and a would-be nobleman whose works supported monarchy and traditionalism in the era of the French Revolution.
He assumed the title of count de Rivarol, claiming to come of a noble Italian family, but is said to have been an innkeeper’s son. His first important work was a treatise, De l’universalité de la langue française (1784), whose sweeping title, “On the Universality of the French Language,” is almost justified by the prestige won by French culture throughout Europe in the 18th century. Rivarol’s satirical gift is displayed to the full in his Le Petit Almanach de nos grands-hommes (1788; “The Little Almanac of Our Great Men”) in which he lampoons all the authors of the day. On the outbreak of the revolution, Rivarol enlisted his journalistic talents in the Royalist cause. Emigrating from France in 1792, he settled for a time in Brussels before moving on to London, Hamburg, and Berlin.
