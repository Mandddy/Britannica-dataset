Johan van Oldenbarnevelt,  (born Sept. 14, 1547, Amersfoort, Spanish Netherlands [now in the Netherlands]—died May 13, 1619, The Hague, Neth.) lawyer, statesman, and, after William I the Silent, the second founding father of an independent Netherlands. He mobilized Dutch forces under William’s son Maurice and devised the anti-Spanish triple alliance with France and England (1596). In the Twelve Years’ Truce (1609) he reaffirmed Holland’s dominant role in the Dutch republic.
Oldenbarnevelt studied law at Leuven (Louvain), Bourges, and Heidelberg (where his ultimate conversion to Protestantism first germinated) and, probably, Padua. After his return to the Netherlands he settled down as an advocaat (“counsel”) at the Hof van Holland, which was effectively the court of appeal for the province of that name, established at The Hague.
