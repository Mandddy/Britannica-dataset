Tincalconite, also called jewelers’ borax,  a borate mineral, hydrated sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O5(OH)4·3H2O), that is found in nature only as a dull, white, fine-grained powder; colourless crystals of the mineral have been made artificially. Tincalconite is common in the borax deposits of southern California, where it often occurs as a coating on kernite or borax, both of which alter to it in a dry atmosphere. For detailed physical properties, see borate mineral (table).
