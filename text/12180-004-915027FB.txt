Pierre Dupuy,  (born Nov. 27, 1582, Agen, Fr.—died  Dec. 14, 1651, Paris) historian and librarian to King Louis XIV of France. He was first to catalog the royal archives (Trésor des chartes) and, with his brother Jacques, the king’s library.
Little is known of Dupuy’s life except that he travelled with his brothers all over France and amassed a collection of some 20,000 books and 1,200 manuscripts, many of great value, which they presented to the King in 1657. Dupuy’s works, mostly documentations of legal problems, include Traité des droits et libertés de l’Eglise gallicane (1639; “Treatise on the Rights and Privileges of the Gallican Church”) and books on the conflict (c. 1300) between Pope Boniface VIII and the French king Philip IV the Fair over the divine right of kings. Dupuy was also employed on the commission constituted to discover the legal titles of the king of France over the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and a book on that subject (1655) is attributed to him.
