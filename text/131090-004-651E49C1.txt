Lichen, any of about 15,000 species of thallophytic plantlike organisms that consist of a symbiotic association of algae (usually green) or cyanobacteria and fungi (mostly ascomycetes and basidiomycetes). Lichens are found worldwide and occur in a variety of environmental conditions. A diverse group of organisms, they can colonize a wide range of surfaces and are frequently found on tree bark, exposed rock, and as a part of biological soil crust. Lichens have been used by humans as food and as sources of medicine and dye. They also provide two-thirds of the food supply for the caribou and reindeer that roam the far northern ranges.
Lichens were once classified as single organismsâ€”until the advent of microscopy, when the association of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria became evident. Although lichens had been assumed to consist of a single fungus species (usually an ascomycete) and a single photosynthetic partner, research suggests that many macrolichens also feature specific basidiomycete yeasts in the cortex of the organism. There is still some discussion about how to classify lichens, though many taxonomists rely on genetic analyses in addition to traditional morphological data.
