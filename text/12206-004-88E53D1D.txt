Raoul Dufy,  (born June 3, 1877, Le Havre, France—died March 23, 1953, Forcalquier) French painter and designer noted for his brightly coloured and highly decorative scenes of luxury and pleasure.
In 1900 Dufy went to Paris to attend the École des Beaux-Arts. He painted in an Impressionist style in his early work, but by 1905 he had begun to employ the broad brushstrokes and bright colours typical of the Fauve artists. A 1907 exhibition of Paul Cézanne’s work convinced Dufy to adopt temporarily more subdued colours and structured compositions. He worked in a Cubist-influenced style with the painters Georges Braque and Émile-Othon Friesz during 1908 and 1909, but he soon returned to his more carefree Fauvist approach.
