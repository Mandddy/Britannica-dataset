Wilhelm Dörpfeld,  (born Dec. 26, 1853, Barmen, Rhenish Prussia [now Wuppertal, Ger.]—died  April 25, 1940, Leukas, Greece) German archaeologist and authority on Greek architecture who excavated the Mycenaean palace at Tiryns (modern Tirins, Greece) and continued the excavation of the famed German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarlık, Tur., the site of ancient Troy.
After working with archaeologist Ernst Curtius on the excavation of ancient Olympia, he joined Schliemann at Troy (1882–90) and brought a new systematic efficiency to Schliemann’s efforts. Together they numbered the successive levels of occupation I–IX. He went with Schliemann to Tiryns in 1884 and in 1885 took charge of excavation, uncovering the first fairly well-preserved Mycenaean palace of the 2nd millennium bc. In his own excavation of Troy (1893 and 1894), he concentrated on the edge of the site and uncovered Middle and Late Bronze Age ruins. He associated the destruction of Priam’s Troy with level VI, though later study indicated it more likely was level VIIa. He prepared detailed architectural plans of level VI and in Troja und Ilion, 2 vol. (1902; “Troy and Ilium”), formulated a chronology for all levels of the site. He served as secretary of the German Archaeological Institute, Athens, from 1887 to 1911. Dörpfeld suggested in Alt-Ithaka, 2 vol. (1927; “Ancient Ithaca”), that modern Leukas was the Ithaca of the Odyssey. He also published Alt-Athen und seine Agora, 2 vol. (1937–39; “Ancient Athens and Its Marketplace”).
