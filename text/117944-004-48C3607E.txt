When Vermont formed an independent republic in 1777, legislators called for the creation of a university, but this was not accomplished until Vermont became a part of the United States in 1791. The University of Vermont, founded on land deeded by Ira Allen, is one of the oldest universities in New England and one of the oldest state universities in the United States. It opened in 1800 with a curriculum that emphasized practical as well as classical studies. The first masterâ€™s degree was awarded in 1807. The College of Medicine was established in 1822 and became a part of the university in 1899. In 1825 the marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Old Mill, the oldest building on campus. In 1865 the University of Vermont absorbed Vermont Agricultural College, which had been founded the previous year as a land-grant college under the aegis of the Morrill Act of 1862. Women were first enrolled in 1871, and in 1875 Vermont became the first university to admit women into Phi Beta Kappa, the national honour society. The Graduate College was created in 1952. Educators Wilbur Fisk and John Dewey attended the university in the 19th century.
