Simon Cowell, in full Simon Phillip Cowell  (born October 7, 1959, Brighton, East Sussex, England) English entrepreneur, recording executive, and television producer and personality, known for his pointed criticism of contestants on such shows as Pop Idol and its American spin-off, American Idol.
After leaving school at age 16, Cowell was hired to work in the mail room at EMI Music Publishing and was eventually given the chance, in 1979, to discover performers to sing newly published songs. In 1985 he and a partner formed Fanfare Records, which enjoyed some success before folding in 1989. Later that year BMG Records hired Cowell as an artist and repertoire consultant. The success of the acts that he signed for BMG established him as an increasingly powerful influence in popular music.
