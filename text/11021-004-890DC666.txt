Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel,  (born Jan. 31, 1741, Gerdauen, Prussia [now Zheleznodorozhny, Russia]—died  April 23, 1796, Königsberg [now Kaliningrad, Russia]) German writer of the late Enlightenment and a disciple of the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Although he was a minor writer of his time, his works enjoyed an unusually long-lasting popularity and can now be seen to have foreshadowed the novels of Jean Paul (Johann Paul Friedrich Richter).
Hippel studied theology at the University of Königsberg in the 1750s and became a tutor. He later reentered the university and studied law; he went on to serve in the town’s court of justice, and in 1780 he was appointed mayor of Königsberg. He assumed the town’s presidency in 1786.
