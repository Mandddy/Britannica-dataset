Thomas Pynchon,  (born May 8, 1937, Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, U.S.) American novelist and short-story writer whose works combine black humour and fantasy to depict human alienation in the chaos of modern society.
After earning a B.A. in English from Cornell University in 1958, Pynchon spent a year in Greenwich Village writing short stories and working on a novel. In 1960 he was hired as a technical writer for Boeing Aircraft Corporation in Seattle, Washington. Two years later he decided to leave the company and write full-time. In 1963 Pynchon won the Faulkner Foundation Award for his first novel, V. (1963), a whimsical, cynically absurd tale of a middle-aged Englishman’s search for “V.,” an elusive supernatural adventuress appearing in various guises at critical periods in European history. In his next book, The Crying of Lot 49 (1966), Pynchon described a woman’s strange quest to discover the mysterious, conspiratorial Tristero System in a futuristic world of closed societies. The novel serves as a condemnation of modern industrialization.
