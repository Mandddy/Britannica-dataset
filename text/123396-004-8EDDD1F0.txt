Hampshire, administrative, geographic, and historic county of south-central England. It is bounded to the west by Dorset and Wiltshire, to the north by Berkshire, to the east by Surrey and West Sussex, and to the south by the English Channel.
The administrative, geographic, and historic counties cover somewhat different areas. The administrative county comprises 11 districts: East Hampshire, Hart, New Forest, Test Valley, the boroughs of Basingstoke and Deane, Eastleigh, Fareham, Gosport, Havant, and Rushmoor, and the city of Winchester (the county seat). The geographic county comprises the whole of the administrative county plus the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton, each of which is a unitary authority. The historic county covers the entire geographic county, the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and the Isle of Wight, and the borough of Christchurch and parts of the district of East Dorset, which together form the eastern edge of the administrative county of Dorset.
