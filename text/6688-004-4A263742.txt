Eubie Blake, byname of James Hubert Blake   (born Feb. 7, 1887, Baltimore, Md., U.S.—died Feb. 12, 1983, Brooklyn, N.Y.) American pianist and composer of ragtime music, popular and vaudeville tunes, and scores for musical theatre—most notably Shuffle Along (1921), his groundbreaking collaboration with singer and lyricist Noble Sissle.
Blake was raised by parents who were former slaves, and he was involved with music from a very young age. When he was four or five he began to play a pump organ at home. As a teenager he played piano in brothels and saloons, and by his mid-20s he had secured steady engagements at the Goldfield Hotel in Baltimore as well as at several clubs in Atlantic City. In 1915 Blake teamed up with the singer and lyricist Noble Sissle, and the duo began composing songs. Their career was given a great boost when one of their songs, “It’s All Your Fault,” was featured in the peformances of the popular vaudeville and nightclub singer Sophie Tucker.
