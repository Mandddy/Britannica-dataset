John Woo, Chinese Wu Yusen  (born October 1946, Guangzhou, China) Chinese film director noted for action movies that combine copious stylized violence with lyrical, melodramatic depictions of male bonding.
In 1950 Woo and his family immigrated to Hong Kong, where they lived in a crime-ridden slum. To escape his surroundings, Woo often went to either the local Chinese Christian church or a movie theatre. He was particularly fond of American musicals and later the films of Sergio Leone, Kurosawa Akira, Sam Peckinpah, and Jean-Pierre Melville.
