Vachel Lindsay, in full Nicholas Vachel Lindsay   (born Nov. 10, 1879, Springfield, Ill., U.S.—died  Dec. 5, 1931, Springfield) American poet who—in an attempt to revive poetry as an oral art form of the common people—wrote and read to audiences compositions with powerful rhythms that had an immediate appeal.
After three years at Hiram College, Hiram, Ohio, Lindsay left in 1900 to study art in Chicago and New York City. He supported himself in part by lecturing for the YMCA and the Anti-Saloon League. Having begun to write poetry, he wandered for several summers throughout the country reciting his poems in return for food and shelter.
