Apatosaurus (genus Apatosaurus), subsumes Brontosaurus,  giant herbivorous sauropod dinosaur, one of the largest land animals of all time, that lived between 147 million and 137 million years ago during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods. Its fossil remains are found in North America and Europe.
Apatosaurus weighed as much as 41 tonnes (roughly 45 tons) and measured up to 23 metres (about 75 feet) long, including its long neck and tail. It had four massive and pillarlike legs, and its tail was extremely long and whiplike. Although some scientists have suggested that the tail could have been cracked supersonically like a bullwhip, this is unlikely, as damage to the vertebrae would have been a more probable result.
