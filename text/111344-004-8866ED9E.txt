Radio jet, material spewing from the centres of some galaxies at close to the speed of light and emitting strong radio waves.
The most powerful extragalactic sources of radio waves are double-lobed sources (or “dumbbells”) in which two large regions of radio emission are situated in a line on diametrically opposite sides of an optical galaxy. The parent galaxy is usually a giant elliptical, sometimes with evidence of recent interaction. The classic example is Cygnus A, the strongest radio source in the direction of the constellation Cygnus. Cygnus A was once thought to be two galaxies of comparable size in collision, but more recent ideas suggest that it is a giant elliptical whose body is bifurcated by a dust lane from a spiral galaxy that it recently swallowed. The collisional hypothesis in its original form was abandoned because of the enormous energies found to be needed to explain the radio emission.
