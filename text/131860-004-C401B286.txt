Johann Bayer,  (born 1572, Rain, Bavaria [Germany]â€”died  March 7, 1625, Augsburg [Germany]) German astronomer whose book Uranometria (1603) promulgated a system of identifying all stars visible to the naked eye.
Bayer entered Ingolstadt University in 1592 to study philosophy and later moved to Augsburg. He became a lawyer by profession but, like many of his time, took a curious interest in the new advances in astronomy, leading to his publication of Uranometria, a popular guide to the constellations. In 1612 he was appointed legal adviser to the city council of Augsburg.
