Screech owl, any of numerous New World owls of the genus Otus, typical owls of the family Strigidae. Old World species of Otus are known as scops owls. Members of both groups possess a facial disk and ear tufts. Coloured in a concealing bark pattern, they are rather small owls, about 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) long. Many show considerable geographic variation; the northern races are larger but less heavily patterned than the southern races. Distributed almost worldwide, notable members of the genus are the common scops owl (Otus scops) of southern Europe, Asia, and Africa; the common screech owl (O. asio) of North America; and the flammulated owl (O. flammeolus) of western North America. They eat mostly small mammals, birds, and insects.
