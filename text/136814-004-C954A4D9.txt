Jeff Koons,  (born January 21, 1955, York, Pennsylvania, U.S.) one of a number of American artists to emerge in the 1980s with an aesthetic devoted to the decadeâ€™s pervasive consumer culture. Koons managed to shock the art world with one audacious work after another, from displaying commercial vacuum cleaners and basketballs as his own art to making porcelain reproductions of kitsch objects to showing homemade pornography.
After studying at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago and working with the Chicago artist Ed Paschke, Koons graduated from the Maryland Institute of Art (B.F.A., 1976) and then moved to New York City, where he sold memberships at the Museum of Modern Art. He later worked as a commodities broker on Wall Street while making art during off-hours. In the early 1980s he began making art full-time.
