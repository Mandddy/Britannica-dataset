Tank destroyer, a highly mobile lightly armoured tank-type vehicle that was used to fight tanks in World War II. Tank destroyers tended to have relatively thin side and rear armour, and the gun was mounted in an open turret or in a casemate that had only a limited traverse. This made tank destroyers lighter, faster, and easier to manufacture, but it also rendered them more vulnerable to enemy fire. They compensated for this with thick frontal armour and a large long-barreled high-velocity gun that was capable of outranging enemy tanks.
The tank destroyer resembled the assault gun because both armoured tracked vehicles had large mounted guns, but the assault gun invariably had a limited traverse, was relatively slow moving, and was used primarily to attack fortifications or other targets at close range.
