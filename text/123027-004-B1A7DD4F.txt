Kunming boasts a long history. As early as 30,000 years ago, ancient tribes inhabited the area around Dian Lake. During the 3rd century bce, Zhuangqiao of the Chu (in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River [Chang Jiang]) led his men to the area around Lake Dian and established the Dian Kingdom. In 109 bce, during the reign (141–87 bce) of the Xi (Western) Han emperor Wudi, the Dian Kingdom became part of the Han territory and was named Yizhou prefecture, with Dianchi county as its seat. It was then an important traffic centre, connecting China’s hinterland with the southern branch of the ancient Silk Road to the west. Via Yunnan, it also connected present-day Sichuan to Vietnam. During the Sui dynasty (581–618), it was renamed Kunzhou.
