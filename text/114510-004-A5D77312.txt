Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, in full Filippo Tommaso Emilio Marinetti  (born Dec. 22, 1876, Alexandria—died  Dec. 2, 1944, Bellagio, Italy) Italian-French prose writer, novelist, poet, and dramatist, the ideological founder of Futurism, an early 20th-century literary, artistic, and political movement.
Marinetti was educated in Egypt, France, Italy, and Switzerland and began his literary career working for an Italian–French magazine in Milan. During most of his life his base was in France, though he made frequent trips to Italy and wrote in the languages of both countries. Such early poetry as the French Destruction (1904) showed the vigour and anarchic experimentation with form characteristic of his later work.
