Zygmunt Krasiński, in full Napoleon Stanisław Adam Ludwik Zygmunt Krasiński   (born February 19, 1812, Paris, France—died February 23, 1859, Paris) Polish Romantic poet and dramatist whose works dealt prophetically with the class conflict that would engender Russia’s October Revolution.
The son of a leading aristocratic family, Krasiński studied law at Warsaw University before taking up studies in Geneva in 1829. He lived most of his life abroad and published his work anonymously. The conflict of loyalty arising from his father’s support of Russian imperialism and his own desire for Poland’s independence occupies a central position in Krasiński’s thought.
