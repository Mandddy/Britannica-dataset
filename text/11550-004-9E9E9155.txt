Dame Adeline Genée, original name in full Anina Margarete Kirstina Petra Jensen   (born January 6, 1878, Hinnerup, Denmark—died April 23, 1970, Esher, England) dancer, choreographer, and teacher who was founder-president of the Royal Academy of Dancing.
The daughter of a farmer, Anina Jensen was adopted at age eight by her uncle, Alexander Genée, director of a modest touring ballet company. Trained by her uncle and his wife, Antonia Zimmermann, she revealed a precocious talent and made her first stage appearance in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway, at age 10 under the name Adeline Genée. After a brief engagement at the Berlin opera, she was engaged in Munich, Germany, where, in 1896, she appeared in Coppélia.
