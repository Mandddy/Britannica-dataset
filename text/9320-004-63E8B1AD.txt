Vale of Glamorgan, county, southern Wales, extending along the Bristol Channel coast west of Cardiff and lying entirely within the historic county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg). It comprises an undulating coastal platform, with an average elevation of about 200 feet (60 metres), that often terminates abruptly in cliffs at the coast. Along other sections of the coast, however, there are sand dunes. Barry is the administrative centre of the county.
The rectangular layout of the town of Cowbridge in the centre of the Vale of Glamorgan, together with the discovery of Roman coins nearby, suggests that the Roman military station of Bovium may have been located there. The Normans built substantial fortifications at both Cowbridge and the coastal town of Barry. The regionâ€™s most significant industrial growth occurred in the 1880s, when massive docks were built at Barry to export coal mined in the Rhondda valley and other valleys to the north. Barry ceased to export coal in the second half of the 20th century.
