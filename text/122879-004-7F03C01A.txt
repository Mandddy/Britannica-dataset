Hans von Bülow, in full Hans Guido, Freiherr (baron) von Bülow  (born Jan. 8, 1830, Dresden, Saxony, Ger.—died  Feb. 12, 1894, Cairo, Egypt) German pianist and conductor whose accurate, sensitive, and profoundly musical interpretations, especially of Richard Wagner, established him as the prototype of the virtuoso conductors who flourished at a later date. He was also an astute and witty musical journalist.
As a child Bülow studied piano under Friedrich Wieck, the father of composer and pianist Clara Schumann, and then with Franz Liszt at Weimer. Later, in Berlin, he was the principal piano teacher at the Stern and Marx conservatories and championed the works of the “New German School” of Liszt and Wagner. Beginning in the 1850s he toured Europe, England, and the United States as a virtuoso pianist; his repertory is said to have included virtually every major work of his day. In 1857 he married Liszt’s daughter Cosima. He became director of music at the Munich court in 1864, where he conducted the premieres of two of Wagner’s works—Tristan und Isolde (1865) and Die Meistersinger (1868; The Mastersingers). Cosima left Bülow for Wagner (whom she married in 1870), but Bülow nonetheless continued to promote Wagner’s music. He conducted at Hannover from 1878 to 1880) and at Meiningen from 1880 to 1885, where his orchestra became one of the finest in Europe. Bülow was also among the earliest interpreters of Johannes Brahms, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Richard Strauss and was one of the first conductors to conduct from memory; his interpretations were noted for their integrity and emotional power.
