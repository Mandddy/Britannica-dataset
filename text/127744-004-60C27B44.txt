Pentlandite,  a nickel and iron sulfide mineral, the chief source of nickel. It is nearly always found with pyrrhotite and similar minerals in silica-poor rocks such as those at Bushveld, S.Af.; Bod√∏, Nor.; and Sudbury, Ont., Can. It has also been found in meteorites. Pentlandite forms crystals that have isometric symmetry. For chemical formula and detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
