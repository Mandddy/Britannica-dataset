Burlesque show,  stage entertainment, developed in the United States, that came to be designed for exclusively male patronage, compounded of slapstick sketches, dirty jokes, chorus numbers, and solo dances usually billed as “daring,” or “sensational,” in their female nudity.
Introduced in the United States in 1868 by a company of English chorus girls, Lydia Thompson’s British Blondes, the burlesque show of the 19th century was patterned after the popular minstrel show. It consisted of three parts: first, a series of songs, coarsely humorous sketches or bits, and comic monologues usually by baggy-pants comics; second, the olio, an assortment of variety acts—e.g., acrobats, magicians, and instrumental and vocal soloists; third, chorus numbers and occasionally a take-off, or burlesque, on politics or a current play. The usual finale was a performance by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match. Burlesque shows, with their show of exposed legs and bawdy and often obscene entertainment, were not considered respectable, and raids by the local police were often prompted by offended citizens.
