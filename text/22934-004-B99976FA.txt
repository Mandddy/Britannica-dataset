Blackfriars Theatre, either of two separate theatres, the second famed as the winter quarters (after 1608) of the King’s Men, the company of actors for whom Shakespeare served as chief playwright and also as a performer.
The name of the theatres derives from their location on the site of a 13th-century Dominican (the Black Friars) priory lying within the City of London between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill. The estates of the priory were split up in 1538 at the suppression of the English monasteries under Henry VIII, and in 1576, under Elizabeth I, Richard Farrant, Master of the Children of the Chapel, leased part of the buildings along the western side of the priory cloisters so that the children could present their plays in this “private” theatre before performing them at court. Other children’s companies also acted there until 1584, when the buildings reverted to their owner.
