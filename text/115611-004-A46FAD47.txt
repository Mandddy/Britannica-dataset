Sholem Aleichem, pseudonym of Sholem Rabinovitsh, Sholem also spelled Shalom or Sholom  (born February 18, 1859, Pereyaslav, Russia [now Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyy, Ukraine]—died May 13, 1916, New York, New York, U.S.) popular author, a humorist noted for his many Yiddish stories of life in the shtetl. He is one of the preeminent classical writers of modern Yiddish literature.
Drawn to writing as a youth, he became a private tutor of Russian at age 17. He later served in the Russian provincial town of Lubny (now in Ukraine) as a “crown rabbi” (official record keeper of the Jewish population; despite the word rabbi, it was not a religious position). While at Lubny he began writing in Yiddish, though he earlier composed his articles in Russian and Hebrew. Between 1883, when his first story in Yiddish appeared, and his death, he published more than 40 volumes of novels, stories, and plays in Yiddish. (He also continued to write in Russian and Hebrew.) A wealthy man through marriage, he used part of the fortune he and his wife inherited to encourage Yiddish writers and edit the annual Di yidishe folks-bibliotek (1888–89; “The Jewish Popular Library”) and lost the rest of it in business.
