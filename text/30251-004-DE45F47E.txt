Henry Brooke,  (born c. 1703, County Cavan, Ire.—died  Oct. 10, 1783, Dublin) Irish novelist and dramatist, best known for The Fool of Quality, one of the outstanding English examples of the novel of sensibility—a novel in which the characters demonstrate a heightened emotional response to events around them. After attending Trinity College, Dublin, Brooke went to London in 1724 to study law. There he became friendly with Alexander Pope; he had already met Jonathan Swift in Ireland.
In 1739 Brooke wrote a celebrated drama, Gustavus Vasa, the Deliverer of His Country, performance of which was forbidden because of the supposition that Sir Robert Walpole, the prime minister, was depicted in the part of the villain. Brooke returned to Ireland, and the play was printed and later performed in Dublin as The Patriot. Brooke’s own patriotic sentiments led to his involvement in the establishment of the influential newspaper The Freeman’s Journal in 1763.
