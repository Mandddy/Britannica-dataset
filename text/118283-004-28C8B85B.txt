Charlock (Sinapis arvensis), also known as charlock mustard or field mustard ,  early-flowering plant of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Charlock is native to the Mediterranean region and has naturalized in temperate regions worldwide; it is an agricultural weed and an invasive species in some areas outside its native range. Charlock reaches 1 metre (3.3 feet) and has stiff bristles on the stems and leaves. The long pod fruits, which form after the clusters of yellow four-petaled flowers bloom, each enclose 10 to 12 black seeds that may remain viable for more than a decade. The plant is closely related to white mustard (Sinapis alba), the seeds of which are used to make the condiment mustard.
