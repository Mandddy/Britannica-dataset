Pediastrum, genus of disk-shaped colonial green algae, characterized by peripheral hornlike projections, comprising part of the freshwater plankton. The number of cells per colony varies (2â€“128) depending on the species. Young cells are uninucleate, whereas mature cells may have up to eight nuclei. During asexual reproduction the cell contents divide and form motile spores that arrange themselves into colonies before being liberated. Sexual reproduction is by motile gametes.
