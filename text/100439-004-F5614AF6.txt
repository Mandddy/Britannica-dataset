ITunes, digital media player application created by Apple in 2001. iTunes was at the forefront of the digital music revolution, providing a free, user-friendly means to play and organize digital music and video files. iTunes was developed as a complete work, with nonstandard interfaces that are independent of the host operating system (OS), inverting the typical hardware/OS/application relationship.
Songs stored on iTunes can be organized across a range of detailed information, allowing the user to search under a variety of headings, including artist, album, song, or genre. It also contains functions that allow the user to create various playlists, create CDs, or listen to songs most recently added to the userâ€™s library. Additionally, iTunes plays streaming audio from the Internet, connecting listeners to radio stations around the world.
