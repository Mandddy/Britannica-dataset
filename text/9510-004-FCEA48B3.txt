George Sand, pseudonym of Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dudevant, née Dupin  (born July 1, 1804, Paris, France—died June 8, 1876, Nohant) French Romantic writer known primarily for her so-called rustic novels.
She was brought up at Nohant, near La Châtre in Berry, the country home of her grandmother. There she gained the profound love and understanding of the countryside that were to inform most of her works. In 1817 she was sent to a convent in Paris, where she acquired a mystical fervour that, though it soon abated, left its mark.
