Unter den Linden, avenue in Berlin, Germany, running eastward from the Brandenburg Gate for nearly a mile. The street is named for the linden (lime) trees that formerly grew along the central promenade and now line the sidewalks.
The focus of Berlin’s social and cultural life before World War II, Unter den Linden was lined with palaces and museums. Many of the buildings were destroyed during the war, but some have been rebuilt or restored. The remains of the former Imperial Palace (1538) were razed in 1951 to create a plaza. Present landmarks along the avenue include the equestrian statue of Frederick II the Great (1851), the State Library, the State Opera House, several new ministries, the Russian embassy (1951), and the Humboldt University of Berlin (formerly Berlin University). The avenue was the site of mass rallies during the East German period. The wide boulevard, which draws many tourists, came alive again after German reunification in 1990, with cafés and shops lining the street and its environs. Unter den Linden leads to Museum Island (Museuminsel; designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999), home to the Old (Altes) and New (Neues) museums, the National Gallery (Nationalgalerie), the Bode Museum, and the Pergamon Museum, which includes the famous Greek altar of Zeus.
