Cai passed the highest level of his civil-service examination in 1890, becoming one of the youngest successful candidates in the history of the imperial examination system. In 1904 he helped organize and became the first president of the Restoration Society (Guangfuhui), a revolutionary group dedicated to the overthrow of the Qing dynasty. Most of this group later became affiliated with the United League (Tongmenghui), formed in 1905 by the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan), and Cai became head of the party’s Shanghai branch.
