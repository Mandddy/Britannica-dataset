Franciscus Gomarus, English Francis Gomar, French François Gomar   (born January 30, 1563, Bruges, Flanders [now in Belgium]—died January 11, 1641, Groningen, Netherlands) Calvinist theologian and university professor whose disputes with his more liberal colleague Jacobus Arminius over the doctrine of predestination led the entire Dutch Reformed Church into controversy.
Gomarus served as pastor of a Dutch Reformed church in Frankfurt am Main from 1587 until 1593, when the congregation was dispersed by anti-Protestant persecution. In 1594 he was appointed professor of theology at the University of Leiden, where he became a leader of the opponents of Arminius. When Arminius joined the faculty in 1603, their disputes increased in intensity.
