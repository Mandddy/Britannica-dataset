Louangphrabang, formerly spelled Luang Prabang,  town, northern Laos. A port on the Mekong River, Louangphrabang lies 130 miles (210 km) north-northwest of Vientiane, the national capital.
From 1353 Louangphrabang, then called Muong Swa, was the capital of the kingdom of Lan Xang. Around 1563 the royal court was removed to Vientiane, and Muong Swa was renamed Luang Prabang in honour of the Pra Bang, a Sinhalese gold Buddha brought to the town probably in 1356. At the partition of Lan Xang in 1707, Luang Prabang became the capital of a new kingdom of the same name. In the reorganization of Laos in 1946–47, the kingdom of Luang Prabang was divided. Louangphrabang remained the royal residence and the religious centre of Laos, but Vientiane was made the nation’s administrative capital. The town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995.
