Steer roping, rodeo event in which a mounted cowboy pursues a full-grown steer with reinforced horns; lassos it with his rope, catching the animal by the horns; fastens the rope to his saddle; and stops his horse suddenly, throwing the steer to the ground. The cowboy then quickly dismounts and ties three of the steerâ€™s feet, raising both hands to signal completion. As in calf roping, the steer must stay tied for six seconds. The event is timed, and the contestant with the fastest time wins. Rodeo single steer roping events are held only at select arenas, and a separate Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) final takes place each year to determine a steer roping champion.
