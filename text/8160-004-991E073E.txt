German shepherd, breed of working dog developed in Germany from traditional herding and farm dogs. Until the 1970s the breed was known as the Alsatian in the United Kingdom. A strongly built, relatively long-bodied dog, the German shepherd stands 22 to 26 inches (56 to 66 cm) and weighs 75 to 95 pounds (34 to 43 kg). Its coat is of coarse, medium-long outer hair and shorter, dense inner hair and ranges from white or pale gray to black and is often gray and black or black and tan. Noted for intelligence, alertness, and loyalty, the German shepherd is used as a guide for the blind and as a watchdog and also serves in police and military work.
