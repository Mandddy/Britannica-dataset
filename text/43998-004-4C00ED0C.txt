Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP), privately owned company that operates one of Canada’s two transcontinental railroad systems. The company was established to complete a transcontinental railroad that the government had begun under the agreement by which British Columbia entered the confederation in 1871. The main line from Montreal to Port Moody, British Columbia (a Vancouver suburb), was completed on Nov. 7, 1885. The company later absorbed other railroads, including several in the United States, and operated maritime interests that ranged from paddle wheelers and steamships on interior waterways to a Pacific Ocean shipping fleet.
Canadian Pacific initially received a land grant of 25 million acres (10 million hectares). Over the years it acquired assets in mining and smelting and in timber. In 1956 it set out to develop these assets, establishing subsidiaries in oil and gas, minerals, fertilizers, food products, forest products, real estate, hotels, finance, trucking, telecommunications, shipping lines, and airlines. These assets were centralized in a holding company, Canadian Pacific Investments Ltd., in 1962 (renamed Canadian Pacific Ltd. in 1971). Canadian Pacific’s passenger services were taken over in 1978 by the crown corporation VIA Rail Canada.
