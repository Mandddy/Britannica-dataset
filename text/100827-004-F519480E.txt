Battle of Queenston Heights,  Queenston also spelled Queenstown,  (Oct. 13, 1812), serious U.S. reverse in the War of 1812, sustained during an abortive attempt to invade Canada. On Oct. 13, 1812, Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer, commanding a force of about 3,100 U.S. militia, sent advance units across the Niagara River. They established themselves on the steep escarpment above Queenston and at first successfully defended their position. The main body of U.S. troops, however, refused to cross the river in support. The advance party was then surrounded by the British, who captured 925 Americans. This failure, along with additional reverses on Lake Champlain, temporarily arrested the U.S. attempt to invade Canada.
