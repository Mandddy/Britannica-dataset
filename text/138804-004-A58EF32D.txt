Guslar, plural guslari ,  the traditional name in the Bosniak-Croatian-Serbian language for an epic singer who performs long narrative tales while accompanying himself on a one- or two-stringed instrument, known as a gusle (gusla). The guslar bows the instrument while holding it vertically between his legs as he sings. (Although there have been female epic singers in the tradition, they are comparatively rare and not often called guslari.) Traditionally, the term was strongly associated with epic singing in Serbia and Montenegro, but it also was widely attested in the historic regions of Bosnia (now, like Herzegovina, part of Bosnia and Herzegovina), Croatia, Dalmatia, and Herzegovina. Well into the 20th century it was not uncommon for songs to narrate historical events dating to the 14th centuryâ€”e.g., the Battle of Kosovo.
The guslar tradition is almost certainly older than that and may well share an origin with other epic singing traditions in cognate Indo-European languages; the paucity of written evidence, however, prevents decisive claims regarding historical origin. It is also impossible to confirm that the metre is originally Indo-European, though some scholars have noted a distant similarity to metres in Russian and Greek. The music of the gusle is largely chromatic, with singers favouring a descending line, sometimes microtonal, but careful research has shown that a variety of melodic types, playing styles, and singing styles are attested within the parameters of the traditional art; the range of variation occurs according to regional micro-traditions and individual performance preferences. The metre of the singing is decasyllabic (10 syllables per verse), with a word boundary regularly occurring after the fourth syllable and with the final two syllables typically held longer (thus, the traditional form entails that 10 linguistic syllables are sung against 12 musical pulses).
