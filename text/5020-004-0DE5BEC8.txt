Cootie Williams, byname of Charles Melvin Williams   (born July 24, 1908?, Mobile, Ala., U.S.—died  Sept. 15, 1985, New York, N.Y.) African-American trumpeter whose mastery of mutes and expressive effects made him one of the most distinctive jazz musicians.
A self-taught trumpeter, Williams toured with several bands, including Lester Young’s family band, in his mid-teens before moving to New York in 1928. The next year he replaced the seminal Bubber Miley in the plunger-muted trumpet role in Duke Ellington’s band, a role that was fundamental to the band’s sound. Influenced by Louis Armstrong, Williams was a more modern stylist than Miley, with a wider range of technique. Moreover, Williams soon expanded his mutes’ ranges of timbres and expression and also became a master of open-horn playing.
