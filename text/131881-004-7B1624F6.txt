Kaposi sarcoma, also called idiopathic multiple pigmented hemorrhagic sarcoma,  rare and usually lethal cancer of the tissues beneath the surface of the skin or of the mucous membranes. The disease can spread to other organs, including the liver, lungs, and intestinal tract. Kaposi sarcoma is characterized by red-purple or blue-brown lesions of the skin, mucous membranes, and other organs. Skin lesions may be firm or compressible, solitary or clustered; in some cases (e.g., African lymphadenopathic Kaposi sarcoma) skin lesions may not appear or may appear subsequent to the involvement of the lymph nodes or development of lesions in other organs.
There are four main types of Kaposi sarcoma: classic, which most often affects men of European or Mediterranean descent who are between the ages of 50 and 70; African, which is confined to equatorial Africa; immunosuppressive treatment-related (or iatrogenic), which was first identified among patients who received immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplantation; and epidemic (or AIDS-associated), which occurs primarily in homosexual men infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and accounts for the majority of cases of the disease. These forms differ further in their course and progression and clinical manifestations. A fifth type, nonepidemic Kaposi sarcoma, which occurs in homosexual men who show no signs of HIV infection, is sometimes also recognized.
