Zhang Huan,  (born Jan. 3, 1965, Anyang, Henan province, China) Chinese artist known for both his early photographed performance art that often showcased his own naked body and for his later production of a great variety of large mass-produced objects.
Zhang earned a B.A. (1988) at Henan University, Kaifeng—where he worked as an instructor from 1988 to 1991—and an M.A. (1993) at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Along with other student artists he formed a collective in a slum of Beijing that came to be known as the East Village. This period was a dramatic time in Chinese history, culminating in 1989 in a series of protests and demonstrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Like many Chinese art students of the time, Zhang was attracted to the avant-garde, but he had limited resources. Perhaps not surprisingly then, his expression took the form of provocative, transgressive performance art that was photographed.
