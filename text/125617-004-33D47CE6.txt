Tennessee River, central component of one of the worldâ€™s greatest irrigation and hydropower systems and a major waterway of the southeastern United States. It is formed by the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers, just east of Knoxville, Tennessee, and flows south-southwest to Chattanooga, Tennessee. Turning west through the Cumberland Plateau into northeastern Alabama, it continues across northern Alabama and bends north on the boundary between Alabama and Mississippi. Continuing north through Tennessee and then Kentucky, it joins the Ohio River at Paducah, Kentucky, after a U-shaped course of 886 miles (1,426 km). Its drainage basin covers about 40,910 square miles (105,960 square km).
The name of the river may have come from a Cherokee Indian village located on the Little Tennessee River and spelled variously Tanase, Tennassee, Tanasi, or Tinasse. The Tennessee was explored during the period of rivalry between the French and the English for the territory west of the Appalachians, and a few small forts and posts were established on its banks. Earlier, explorers and fur traders had entered the lower course of the river from the Ohio River. Although the Tennessee served as a route for settlers moving southwestward, its role as a westward passage was negligible compared with that of the Ohio.
