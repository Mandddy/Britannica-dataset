United States Women’s Open Championship, byname U.S. Women’s Open,  annual golf tournament conducted by the United States Golf Association (USGA) that is open to all qualified amateur and professional female golfers. The U.S. Women’s Open is recognized by the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) as one of the organization’s four major championships.
The tournament was founded by the Women’s Professional Golf Association (WPGA) in 1946 as a match play (most holes won) event. It took up its current 72-hole stroke play (lowest score) format the following year. After the WPGA folded in 1949, the LPGA ran the U.S. Women’s Open until 1953, when it ceded control of the event to the USGA. The site of the tournament rotates among a number of private and public courses throughout the United States.
