Aḥad Haʿam, (
        Hebrew: “One of the People”, ) original name Asher Ginzberg   (born Aug. 18, 1856, Skvira, near Kiev, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]—died  Jan. 2, 1927, Tel Aviv, Palestine [now in Israel]) Zionist leader whose concepts of Hebrew culture had a definitive influence on the objectives of the early Jewish settlement in Palestine.
Reared in Russia in a rigidly Orthodox Jewish family, he mastered rabbinic literature but soon was attracted to the rationalist school of medieval Jewish philosophy and to the writings of the Haskala (“Enlightenment”), a liberal Jewish movement that attempted to integrate Judaism with modern Western thought.
