Dashiell Hammett, in full Samuel Dashiell Hammett  (born May 27, 1894, St. Mary’s County, Md., U.S.—died  Jan. 10, 1961, New York City) American writer who created the hard-boiled school of detective fiction. (See detective story; hard-boiled fiction).
Hammett left school at 13 and worked at a variety of low-paying jobs before working eight years as a detective for the Pinkerton agency. He served in World War I, contracted tuberculosis, and spent the immediate postwar years in army hospitals. He began to publish short stories and novelettes in pulp magazines and wrote two novels—Red Harvest and The Dain Curse (both published in 1929)—before writing The Maltese Falcon (1930), generally considered his finest work. It introduced Sam Spade, Hammett’s fictional detective creation, played by Humphrey Bogart in the film version directed by John Huston (1941), which became a classic of its genre. He also wrote The Glass Key (1931) and The Thin Man (1934), which initiated a motion picture and later a television series built around his detecting couple, Nick and Nora Charles. Nora was based on the playwright Lillian Hellman, with whom he formed a romantic alliance in 1930 that lasted until his death. Her Pentimento (1973) has an account of their life together.
