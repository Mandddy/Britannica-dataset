Pickens, county, northwestern South Carolina, U.S. It is bounded to the north by North Carolina, to the east by the Saluda River, and to the west by Lakes Jocassee (impounded by the Jocassee Dam), Keowee (impounded by the Keowee Dam), and Hartwell, on the Keowee and Seneca rivers. The countyâ€™s northern section lies in rough Blue Ridge Mountains terrain near the southern end of the Appalachian chain and includes Table Rock and Keowee Toxaway state parks. Sassafras Mountain, located on the North Carolina border, is the highest point in South Carolina, at 3,560 feet (1,085 metres). The Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway virtually divides the county; to the south are piedmont foothills. Approximately two-thirds of the region is wooded, mostly in upland hardwoods.
The region was once the centre of lower Cherokee civilization, disputed between Native Americans and British in the 1756 Cherokee War and later conflicts and surrendered to the United States in a 1785 treaty. Lowland inhabitants fleeing malaria in their coastal home regions made it a popular resort area as early as the 18th century. The county was established in 1826 and named for Andrew Pickens, a general in the American Revolution. Clemson University (founded 1889) is located in the town of Clemson.
