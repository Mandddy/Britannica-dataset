Shining leaf chafer,  any member of the insect subfamily Rutelinae of the scarab family Scarabaeidae (order Coleoptera), including some of the most beautifully coloured and most destructive beetles. The iridescent and metallic colours of most species are produced by pigments in the integument (“skin”). The majority of the species are tropical or subtropical.
The North American goldsmith beetle (Cotalpa lanigera) is broad and oval and is about 20 to 26 mm (0.8–1 inch) long. It is coloured a shining gold on the head and thorax (region behind the head) and is copper-coloured on the underside of the body. A related species, the common vine pelidnota (Pelidnota punctata), occurs throughout North America. It is bright orange-brown with three black spots on each wing cover (elytra). The larvae feed on grapevine roots, the adults on the leaves; both can be quite destructive. The Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica), which has become a major pest in North America, is also a member of this group.
