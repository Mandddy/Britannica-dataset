Gregory Corso, in full Gregory Nunzio Corso   (born March 26, 1930, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 17, 2001, Robbinsdale, Minnesota) American poet, a leading member in the mid-1950s of the Beat movement.
Corso lived in an orphanage and with foster parents until he was 11, when his remarried father took him to live with him. A repeated runaway, he was placed in juvenile institutions. At 17 he was sentenced to three years in Clinton Prison in Dannemora, New York, for theft. While there, he was introduced to literature. He met the poet Allen Ginsberg in Greenwich Village in 1950 and through him continued his education as a writer and a “noninstitutionalized” man. Corso worked in 1951–52 for the Los Angeles Examiner and then traveled to South America and Africa. In 1955 his first volume of verse, The Vestal Lady on Brattle, was published.
