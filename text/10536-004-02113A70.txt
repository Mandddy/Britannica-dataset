Kazakh, also spelled Kazak,  an Asiatic Turkic-speaking people inhabiting mainly Kazakhstan and the adjacent parts of the Uighur Autonomous Region of Sinkiang in China. The Kazakhs emerged in the 15th century from an amalgam of Turkic tribes who entered Transoxiana about the 8th century and of Mongols who entered the area in the 13th century. At the end of the 20th century there were roughly 7,600,000 in Kazakhstan and about 1,200,000 in China (mainly in Sinkiang), with small numbers in Uzbekistan, Russia, and Mongolia. The Kazakhs are the second most numerous Turkic-speaking people in Central Asia after the Uzbeks.
The Kazakhs were traditionally pastoral nomads, dwelling year-round in portable, dome-shaped tents (called gers, or yurts) constructed of dismountable wooden frames covered with felt. The Kazakhs migrated seasonally to find pasturage for their livestock, including horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and a few camels. The diet consisted largely of milk products supplemented by mutton. Fermented mareâ€™s milk (koumiss) and horse flesh were highly esteemed but usually available only to the prosperous. Felt made the tent snug inside and out and was used for cloaks. Hides provided clothing, containers, and thongs; horsehair was braided into rope, while horn was used for ladles and other utensils.
