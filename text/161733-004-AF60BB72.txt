In 1900 the U.S. government agreed to grant lands to the state of Kansas for a state college, a state park, and an agricultural experiment station. The land named in the grant had once been Fort Hays Military Reservation, which had been abandoned in 1889. The college, named the Western Branch of the Kansas Normal School of Emporia, opened in 1902. In 1914 the school separated from the school in Emporia and became Fort Hays Kansas State Normal School. The school became the Kansas State Teachers College of Hays in 1923. The awarding of liberal arts degrees was approved in 1931, and the name was changed to Fort Hays State College. It was elevated to university status in 1977.
