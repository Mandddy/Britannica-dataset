Ayaan Hirsi Ali, original name Ayaan Hirsi Magan  (born Nov. 13, 1969, Mogadishu, Som.) Somali-born Dutch activist, writer, and politician best known for her contention that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with Western democratic values, especially those upholding the rights of women. Projecting her views most extensively through her internationally best-selling autobiographical books, she drew exuberant praise from her strongest advocates and threats of death from her strongest detractors.
Ayaan Hirsi Magan was born into a devout Somali Muslim family. Her father, Hirsi Magan Isse, was a political dissident who spent several years in jail. When he escaped into self-imposed exile in the mid-1970s, his family followed him from Somalia to Saudi Arabia, then briefly to Ethiopia, before settling in Kenya, where Ayaan spent most of her youth. Throughout her school years, Ayaan received a strict Muslim education, and as a young girl, she underwent traditional Somali female genital cutting, ordered by her grandmother in the name of Islam. In 1992 Ayaan was married—against her will—to a distant cousin. While en route to join him in Canada, she fled to the Netherlands, where she applied successfully for political asylum; during the process she changed her name to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and adjusted her birth date to make it difficult for her family to find her.
