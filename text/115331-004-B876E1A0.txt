Anne Hébert,  (born August 1, 1916, Sainte-Catherine-de-Fossambault, Quebec, Canada—died January 22, 2000, Montreal, Quebec) French Canadian poet, novelist, and playwright noted as an original literary stylist. She lived most of her adult life in Paris.
Hébert spent her early years largely confined to her family’s country home. In her youth she was encouraged to write by her father, who was a well-known poet and literary critic, and by her poet cousin, Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau. She published her first poems, later collected in Les Songes en équilibre (1942; “Dreams in Equilibrium”), in literary journals. This volume—which she did not include in her later collection Oeuvres poétique (1993; “Poetic Works”)—was an apprentice work, somewhat romantic and traditional, though technically skilled. It gave little indication of the powerful writer who was to emerge. During this period of her life, she also wrote for television, radio, and the theatre. Her first book of prose, Le Torrent (1950; The Torrent), is a collection of violent stories centring on a young boy damaged by his brutal mother. It was followed by a second poetry collection, Le Tombeau des rois (1953; The Tomb of the Kings), which more clearly reveals her inner anguish and intensity of purpose. Quebec publishers became wary of her work, so aided by a gift from the Royal Society of Canada she moved to Paris to find a more sympathetic audience. After publishing Poèmes (1960), which included the poems of Le Tombeau des rois, Mystère de la parole (“The Mystery of the Words”), and a significant essay on poetry and for which she won her first Governor General’s Award, she turned chiefly to fiction.
