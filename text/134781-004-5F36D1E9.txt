Adrian IV, original name Nicholas Breakspear, also known as Hadrian IV  (born 1100?, Abbot’s Langley, near St. Albans, Hertfordshire, Eng.—died  Sept. 1, 1159, Anagni, near Rome [Italy]) the only Englishman to occupy the papal throne (1154–59).
He became a canon regular of St. Ruf near Avignon, Fr., and in about 1150 Pope Eugenius III appointed him cardinal bishop of Albano, Italy. Eugenius sent him in 1152 as legate to Scandinavia, where his mission to reorganize the hierarchy was so successful that on his return in 1154 he was elected pope (December 4). Adrian crowned Frederick I Barbarossa as Holy Roman emperor in 1155, after Frederick had captured and handed over to him Arnold of Brescia, who had led a revolt in Rome. Although Arnold was hanged and burned at the stake in 1155 and his ashes scattered over the Tiber River, Adrian’s conflict with the commune of Rome continued.
