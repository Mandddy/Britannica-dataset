Bat Masterson, byname of Bartholomew Masterson, pseudonym William Barclay Masterson  (born Nov. 27, 1853, Henryville, Canada East [Quebec]—died  October 25, 1921, New York, N.Y., U.S.) gambler, saloonkeeper, lawman, and newspaperman who made a reputation in the old American West.
Born in Canada, Masterson grew up on successive family farms in New York, Illinois, and Kansas. Leaving home at 19, he eventually became a buffalo hunter and Indian scout, working out of Dodge City, Kan. (1873–75). In January 1876 in Sweetwater, Texas, he killed a man and a dance-hall girl in a quarrel and fled back to Dodge City. There, except for brief intervals, he spent the next decade, becoming sometime Ford county sheriff (1877–79) and deputy U.S. marshal (1879) identified with the local town bosses known as “the Gang,” but working mostly as saloonkeeper and gambler. He made occasional visits to other western towns, including Tombstone, Ariz., where he briefly worked with Wyatt Earp at the Oriental Saloon. He ended his Western days in plush Denver gambling houses (1887–1902), until reform-minded citizens asked him to leave.
