Datong, Wade-Giles romanization Ta-tâ€™ung,  city, northern Shanxi sheng (province), northern China. The city is situated at the northern limits of traditional Chinese settlement, just south of the Great Wall on a fertile plain watered by the Sanggan River and its tributaries. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 1,028,730; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 1,873,000.
During the 2nd and 1st centuries bce, the region was the headquarters for the eastern frontier command of the Han armies protecting the area against the militant, nomadic Xiongnu. After the 1st century ce the area was lost by the Chinese, and it was recovered by them only in the latter half of the 3rd century. In 398 ce the Tuoba founders of the Bei (Northern) Wei dynasty established and maintained their capital there even when they controlled all of North China. The seat of their dynasty was finally transferred south to Luoyang in Henan province at the end of the 5th century. The city of Datong was walled in 421, the outer wall being some 10 miles (16 km) in circumference. Vast numbers of Chinese were forcibly removed from elsewhere in the north to settle the area. In spite of the logistic problems arising from having a capital far from the rich revenue-producing parts of the North Chinese empire, the city was of considerable size and splendour. In addition to its palaces and official buildings, constructed by the Wei royal family, who were pious Buddhists, the extensive Buddhist cave temples of Yungang were also built during that period on the western outskirts of the city.
