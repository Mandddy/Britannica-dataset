Ameura, genus of trilobites (extinct arthropods) found as fossils in North America rocks dating from the Late Carboniferous to the Late Permian Period (from 318 million to 251 million years ago). Ameura is characterized by a well-developed cephalon (head) and a long pygidium (tail region) that includes many segments of the central axial lobe. Fossil specimens of these trilobites are frequently found rolled up in a defensive position, as if the animals were attempting to shield their vulnerable undersides.
