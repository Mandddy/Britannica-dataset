Eliza Haywood, née Fowler  (born 1693?—died  Feb. 25, 1756, London) prolific English writer of sensational romantic novels that mirrored contemporary 18th-century scandals.
She left her husband, a middle-aged clergyman, for the stage, supporting herself also by writing and adapting works for the theatre. She then turned to the extravagantly passionate fiction for which there was then a vogue, adopting the technique of writing novels based on scandals involving leaders of society, whom she denoted by initials. (The British Museum in London has a key giving their full names.) Among such works are Memoirs of a Certain Island Adjacent to the Kingdom of Utopia (1725) and The Secret History of the Present Intrigues of the Court of Caramania (1727).
