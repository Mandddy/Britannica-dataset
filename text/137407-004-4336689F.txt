Bittern, any of 12 species of solitary marsh birds of the subfamily Botaurinae, family Ardeidae (order Ciconiiformes), allied to the herons (subfamily Ardeinae) but with shorter neck and stouter body. Most bitterns bear a camouflage pattern—streaks of variegated brown and buff—which enables them to escape detection by standing upright with bill pointed upward, imitating the reeds and grasses of their habitat. They feed upon fish, frogs, crayfish, and other small swamp and marsh animals, which they spear with their sharp-pointed bills. Bitterns occur almost worldwide. There are four species of Botaurus and eight species of Ixobrychus.
Bitterns of the genus Botaurus, occurring mainly in temperate regions, are large, and the sexes look alike. In spring the male utters booming calls audible for a considerable distance. The female undertakes nesting duties; assembling a crude mass of vegetation near water level, she lays four to six brownish eggs. The largest member of the genus is the Eurasian bittern (B. stellaris), to 75 cm (30 inches), ranging from the British Isles to southeastern Asia and occurring also in South Africa. The American bittern (B. lentiginosus), known locally as “stake driver” or “thunder pumper,” is slightly smaller. Other forms are the Australian bittern (B. poiciloptilus) and the South American, or pinnated, bittern (B. pinnatus).
