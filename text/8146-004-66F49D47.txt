Great Dane, breed of working dog developed at least 400 years ago in Germany, where it was used for boar hunting. The Great Dane is typically a swift, alert dog noted for courage, friendliness, and dependability. It has a massive, square-jawed head and body lines that give it an elegant appearance. Its short coat is black, fawn (golden brown), brindle, blue-gray, harlequin (white with black patches), or mantle (white with a black “blanket” extending over the body). The fawn and brindle dogs have a black mask. The Great Dane is the tallest of the working breeds, with males standing at least 30 inches (76 cm) and females at least 28 inches (71 cm); it weighs 120 to 150 pounds (54 to 68 kg). Its name was derived from one of its French names, Grand Danois (Big Danish), although there is no known reason to associate Denmark with the history or origin of the breed. In Germany the breed is called the Deutsche Dogge (German dog).
