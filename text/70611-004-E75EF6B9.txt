Coin collecting, also called numismatics,  the systematic accumulation and study of coins, tokens, paper money, and objects of similar form and purpose. The collecting of coins is one of the oldest hobbies in the world. With the exception of China and Japan, the introduction of paper money is for the most part a recent development (meaning since the 18th century). Hence, while paper money and other types of notes are collectible, the history of that form of collecting is distinct from coins and largely a modern phenomenon.
The long-held view that coin collecting began with the Italian Renaissance has been challenged by evidence that the activity is even more venerable. Suetonius (ad 69â€“122) relates in his De vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars; Augustus 75) that the emperor Augustus was fond of old and foreign coins and gave them as gifts to his friends. In addition to this account and a variety of other literary accounts of collecting from Greek and Roman sources, there is tangible archaeological evidence that coins have been collected at least from the Roman era and probably for as long as they have existed. For example, a hoard of some 70 Roman gold coins found at Vidy, Switzerland, did not contain any two specimens of the same type, which implies that the coins were collected during the period of Roman rule in that town.
