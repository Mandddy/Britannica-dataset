Simon Ammann,  (born June 25, 1981, Grabs, Switzerland) Swiss ski jumper who won the individual normal hill and the individual large hill gold medals at both the 2002 and 2010 Olympic Winter Games, becoming the first man to sweep the individual ski jumping events at two Olympics.
Ammann began ski jumping at age 11, learning the sport at a 100-foot (30-metre) hill near his family’s farm in Unterwasser, Switzerland. He first participated in the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) Ski Jumping World Cup competition during the 1997–98 season, and he was a member of the Swiss ski jumping team at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, where he finished in 35th and 39th place, respectively, in the individual normal hill and individual large hill events. His nondescript Olympic debut did not prepare observers for what Ammann accomplished at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. There Ammann—despite having never previously won a single event on the World Cup or FIS world championship level—became just the second Olympian (after Finland’s Matti Nykanen in 1988) to win the normal hill and large hill double gold medals.
