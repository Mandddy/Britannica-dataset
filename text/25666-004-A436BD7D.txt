William Plomer,  (born Dec. 10, 1903, Transvaal, S.Af.—died  Sept. 21, 1973, Lewes, East Sussex, Eng.) South African-born British man of letters, whose writing covered many genres: poetry, novels, short stories, memoirs, and even opera librettos.
Plomer was educated in England but returned with his family to South Africa after World War I. His experience as an apprentice on a remote farm in the eastern Cape when he was 17 alerted him to the literary possibilities of the South African landscape and established the sensibility of his early works. His first novel, Turbott Wolfe (1925), caused a scandal because it touched upon miscegenation and dared to criticize the supposed benevolence of whites toward blacks, even casting some white characters in the role of villains. I Speak of Africa (1927), a collection of short stories, exacerbated his reputation. In collaboration with Laurens Van Der Post and the iconoclastic poet Roy Campbell, he founded a magazine called Voorslag (“Whiplash”) with which he intended to excoriate South African racist society. Public outrage silenced the journal, and Plomer and Campbell left the country.
