Ma Rainey, byname of Gertrude Malissa Nix Rainey, née Gertrude Malissa Nix Pridgett  (born April 26, 1886, Columbus, Ga., U.S.—died Dec. 22, 1939, Rome, Ga.) American singer, the “mother of the blues,” recognized as the first great black professional blues vocalist.
Gertrude Pridgett made her first public appearance about the age of 14 in a local talent show called “Bunch of Blackberries” at the Springer Opera House in her native Columbus, Georgia. Little else is known of her early years. In February 1904 she married William Rainey, a vaudeville performer known as Pa Rainey, and for several years they toured with African American minstrel groups as a song-and-dance team. In 1902, in a small Missouri town, she first heard the sort of music that was to become known as the blues.
