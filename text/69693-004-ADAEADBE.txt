Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic inflammation of the intestines that results in impaired absorption of nutrients. IBD encompasses two disorders: Crohn disease (regional ileitis) and ulcerative colitis. The onset of IBD typically occurs between the ages of 15 and 35, and the disease tends to run in families.
The factors that trigger intestinal inflammation and onset of IBD remain unknown. Symptoms of IBD may develop suddenly or gradually and include constipation, diarrhea, fever, rectal bleeding, and abdominal discomfort. In both Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, patients may experience periods of symptom remission and relapse. IBD is particularly difficult to diagnose in children, and affected children may fail to grow properly. In addition to physical examination, blood tests, and stool analysis, IBD may be diagnosed by colonoscopy, in which the entire colon is investigated, or sigmoidoscopy, in which only the rectum and sigmoid colon are investigated. Individuals with a family history of IBD may undergo genetic testing for specific gene mutations to determine their susceptibility to the disease.
