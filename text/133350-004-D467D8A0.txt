Friedrich von Holstein, byname The Gray Eminence German Die Graue Eminenz  (born April 24, 1837, Schwedt an der Oder, Pomerania—died May 8, 1909, Berlin, Germany) the most influential German foreign policymaker from 1890 to 1909, during the reign of Emperor William II (Kaiser Wilhelm II), after the departure of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. A member of the Foreign Office in Berlin uninterruptedly from 1876, he never became foreign minister but exercised his large power behind the scenes, as a “gray eminence.”
Holstein was raised on his family’s estate in Pomerania and their town house in Berlin. Throughout his youth, his family spent a great deal of time traveling abroad, and Holstein became fluent in several foreign languages. A sickly boy, he was educated mostly by private tutors, and, after studying at the University of Berlin, he joined the legal section of the Prussian government.
