After a series of name changes the school became Colorado State University in 1957. Virtually from the outset, education and research in agriculture and forestry have been a central part of the university’s mission. Separate from the main campus are a 775-acre (315-hectare) agriculture campus for experimentation and research; Foothills Campus, site of research projects; and Pingree Park, a forestry, natural resource management, and wildlife and fishery biology field campus in the Rocky Mountains.
