Planck, a European Space Agency satellite, launched on May 14, 2009, that measured the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the residual radiation left over from the big bang, at a much greater sensitivity and resolution than was provided by the U.S. Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). It was named in honour of German physicist Max Planck, a pioneer in quantum physics and in the theory of blackbody radiation. It was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket that also carried Herschel, an infrared space telescope.
Like WMAP, Planck was positioned near the second Lagrangian point (L2), a gravitational balance point between Earth and the Sun and 1.5 million km (0.9 million miles) opposite the Sun from Earth. The spacecraft moved in a controlled Lissajous pattern around L2 rather than “hovering” there. This isolated the spacecraft from radio emissions from Earth and the Moon without having to place it on a more distant trajectory that would complicate tracking. The spacecraft spun once per minute and shifted its rotational axis every 15 minutes to shield itself from the Sun. Five complete scans of the sky were made during the mission, which ended in 2013.
