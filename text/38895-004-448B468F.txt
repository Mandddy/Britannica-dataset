Thomas Southerne,  (born 1660, Oxmantown, Dublin, Ire.—died  May 26, 1746, London, Eng.) Irish dramatist, long famous for two sentimental tragedies that were acted until well into the 19th century—The Fatal Marriage (performed 1694; adapted 1757 by the actor-manager David Garrick as Isabella, or the Fatal Marriage) and Oroonoko (performed 1695).
Southerne was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, but spent his life after about 1680 in London, where he began to study law. His first play, The Loyal Brother, was produced at London’s Drury Lane Theatre in 1682. From 1685 to 1688 he was soldiering, but he wrote several other plays and contributed prologues and epilogues to John Dryden’s plays.
