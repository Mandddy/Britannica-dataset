William G. McAdoo, in full William Gibbs McAdoo  (born October 31, 1863, near Marietta, Georgia, U.S.—died February 1, 1941, Washington, D.C.) U.S. secretary of the treasury (1913–18), a founder and chairman (1914) of the Federal Reserve Board, and director general of the U.S. railroads during and shortly after World War I (1917–19). He directed four fund-raising drives that raised $18,000,000,000 to help finance the Allied war effort.
McAdoo began his career as a lawyer in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He moved to New York City (1892), where he organized and headed two companies (later consolidated as the Hudson and Manhattan Railway Company) that built tunnels under the Hudson River. He supported Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1910 gubernatorial election in New Jersey and in the 1912 presidential campaign. As treasury secretary, he became one of Wilson’s most-trusted officials. In 1914, after the death of his first wife, McAdoo married the president’s daughter, Eleanor Randolph Wilson, in a White House ceremony.
