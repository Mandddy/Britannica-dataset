Flinders River,  longest river in Queensland, Australia, rising on the southwestern slopes of the Gregory Range (Eastern Highlands) in the northern section of the state, 100 mi (160 km) west of Charters Towers, and flowing west past Hughenden and Richmond; it then curves northwest and north to enter the Gulf of Carpentaria through two mouths, the second known as the Bynoe River, after a course of 520 mi. Fed by the Saxby and Cloncurry rivers, the Flinders seasonally drains a 41,600-sq-mi (107,700-sq-km) basin, with only its lowest 70 mi usually perennial. It was named for the English navigator Matthew Flinders by Captain John Stokes of HMS Beagle. The riverâ€™s valley was first settled in 1864. The riverine lands, particularly nearer the gulf, are used in part for raising cattle and sheep.
