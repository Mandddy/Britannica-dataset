National bank, in the United States, any commercial bank chartered and supervised by the federal government and operated by private individuals.
The first Bank of the United States (1791–1811) and the second Bank of the United States (1816–36) had functioned as agents of the U.S. Treasury and competed with the state, or private, banks, thereby ensuring that the private banks redeemed their banknotes at full value. In spite of its contribution to national monetary stability, the second Bank of the United States had come under attack by President Andrew Jackson, and its charter failed to be renewed in 1836; a chaotic period of state banking resulted that lasted until the American Civil War. The difficulties in financing that war pointed to the need for a better banking system and a sounder currency.
