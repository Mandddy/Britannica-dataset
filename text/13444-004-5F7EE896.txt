Anna, in full Anna Ivanovna   (born Jan. 28 [Feb. 7, New Style], 1693, Moscow, Russia—died  Oct. 17 [Oct. 28], 1740, St. Petersburg) empress of Russia from 1730 to 1740.
Daughter of Ivan V (reigned 1682–96) and niece of Peter I the Great (reigned 1682–1725), Anna was married to Frederick William, ruler of the Baltic seacoast duchy of Courland, on Oct. 31 (Nov. 11), 1710. Although her husband died on the journey to Courland after their wedding in St. Petersburg, Anna remained at Mitau (now Jelgava, Latvia), the capital of Courland, until 1730, when Peter II died and the Supreme Privy Council, the actual ruling body in Russia (1726–30), offered her the Russian throne.
