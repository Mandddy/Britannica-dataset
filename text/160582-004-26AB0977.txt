Thomas Ken,  (born July 1637, Berkhampsted, Hertfordshire, England—died March 19, 1711, near Warminster, Wiltshire) Anglican bishop, hymn writer, royal chaplain to Charles II of England, and one of seven bishops who in 1688 opposed James II’s Declaration of Indulgence, which was designed to promote Roman Catholicism.
Ordained about 1661, Ken held several ecclesiastical positions until 1669, when he became a prebendary of Winchester Cathedral. In 1679 Ken was appointed chaplain to Princess Mary of York, wife of Prince William of Orange and daughter of James, duke of York, who later became King James II. The following year Ken became royal chaplain to Charles II and soon after made his refusal to vacate his house in Winchester to the actress Nell Gwyn, Charles II’s mistress. In 1685 he became bishop of Bath and Wells and the same year attended Charles on his deathbed.
