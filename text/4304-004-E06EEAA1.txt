Allende meteorite, meteorite that fell as a shower of stones (see meteorite shower) after breaking up in the atmosphere at Chihuahua, Mex., near the village of Pueblito de Allende, in February 1969. More than two tons of meteorite fragments were collected. Fortuitously, the Allende meteorite fell shortly before the first rock samples from the Moon were brought to Earth by Apollo astronauts, and its pieces were analyzed by many scientists in preparation for handling lunar rocks.
The Allende meteorite, which is classified as a carbonaceous chondrite, consists of large, irregularly shaped white inclusions and rounded chondrules in a dark matrix. The inclusions are composed of minerals believed to have condensed at high temperatures from a gas having the composition of the Sun, and their time of formation is older than that of any other known solar system material. The inclusions in Allende and other carbonaceous chondrites are thought to be the earliest-formed solids in the solar nebula.
