Titanium processing, the extraction of titanium from its ores and the preparation of titanium alloys or compounds for use in various products.
Titanium (Ti) is a soft, ductile, silvery gray metal with a melting point of 1,675 째C (3,047 째F). Owing to the formation on its surface of an oxide film that is relatively inert chemically, it has excellent corrosion resistance in most natural environments. In addition, it is light in weight, with a density (4.51 grams per cubic centimetre) midway between aluminum and iron. Its combination of low density and high strength gives it the most efficient strength-to-weight ratio of common metals for temperatures up to 600 째C (1,100 째F).
