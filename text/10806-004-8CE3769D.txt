Incense cedar, also called white cedar,  (species Calocedrus decurrens), ornamental and timber evergreen conifer of the cypress family (Cupressaceae). It is native primarily to the western slopes of the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges of North America, at altitudes of 300 to 2,800 metres (1,000 to 9,200 feet). The incense cedar, named for the odour its leaves emit when bruised, may grow 30 to 45 metres (100 to 150 feet) tall and up to 5.5 metres (18 feet) in diameter. The tree has a straight trunk, with reddish, furrowed bark, and spreading branches that end in sprays of branchlets, covered with dark green leaves. Both juvenile and mature leaves are usually present. Timber from incense cedar is used for carpentry, pencils, storage chests, interiors, and fence posts.
