Amīr Khosrow,  (born 1253, Patiāli [now in Uttar Pradesh, India]—died  1325, Delhi) poet and historian, considered one of India’s greatest Persian-language poets.
Amīr Khosrow was the son of a Turkish officer in the service of Iltutmish, sultan of Delhi, and for his entire life he enjoyed the patronage of the Muslim rulers of Delhi, especially Sultan Ghīyās-ud-Dīn Balban and his son Muḥammad Khān of Multān. During his youth he became a dedicated follower of the saint of Delhi, Muḥammad Niẓām-ud-Dīn Awliyā, of the Chishtī dervish order; eventually he was buried next to the saint’s tomb.
