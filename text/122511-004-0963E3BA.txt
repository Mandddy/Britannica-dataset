Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), also called potato bug,  insect pest that attacks the leaves of potato plants. This leaf beetle belongs to the subfamily Chrysomelinae of the family Chrysomelidae (order Coleoptera). It is native to western North America and originally fed on buffalo bur, a wild plant of the potato family abundant in the Rocky Mountain region. It began feeding on cultivated potatoes when they were introduced into western North America. By 1874 the beetle had become an important potato pest, spreading wherever potatoes were cultivated. The Colorado potato beetle is hemispherical in shape, about 10 mm (0.4 inch) long, and orange-red or yellow in colour, with black stripes on its wing covers (elytra). The female deposits between about 300 and 500 eggs on the underside of potato leaves. The red, plump, leaf-feeding larvae pupate underground and are usually not seen until they emerge as adults. Depending on the latitude, from one to three generations may occur each year.
