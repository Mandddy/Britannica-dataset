Prajnaparamita, (
        Sanskrit: “Perfection of Wisdom”) body of sutras and their commentaries that represents the oldest of the major forms of Mahayana Buddhism, one that radically extended the basic concept of ontological voidness (shunyata). The name denotes the female personification of the literature or of wisdom, sometimes called the Mother of All Buddhas. In the Prajnaparamita texts, prajna (wisdom), an aspect of the original Eightfold Path, has become the supreme paramita (perfection) and the primary avenue to nirvana. The content of this wisdom is the realization of the illusory nature of all phenomena—not only of this world, as in earlier Buddhism, but of transcendental realms as well.
The main creative period of Prajnaparamita thought extended from perhaps 100 bce to 150 ce. The best-known work from this period is the Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita (Eight Thousand-Verse Prajnaparamita). The first Chinese translation appeared in 179 ce. Later some 18 “portable editions” were forthcoming, the best-known of which is the Diamond Sutra. Still later, schematic and scholastic commentaries were produced in the Madhyamika (“Middle Way”) monasteries of eastern India, thus introducing into the Prajnaparamita movement the same confining rationalism against which it had reacted in the first place. The radically anti-ontological stance had been intended to free the spirit in its quest for experiential enlightenment.
