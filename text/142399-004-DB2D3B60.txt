Vahana, (
        Sanskrit: “mount” or “vehicle”) in Hindu mythology, the creature that serves as the vehicle, or “carrier,” and as the sign of a particular deity. The vahana accompanies, pulls the chariot of, or serves as the seat or mount of his god. Images of the vahana are also used on banners and emblems to identify the god or the cult affiliation of the devotee.
The vahanas of the major gods, such as Shiva’s bull Nandi and Vishnu’s eagle Garuda, have a considerable mythology of their own. The vahanas of other gods include the hamsa (goose or swan) of Brahma and Sarasvati, the bandicoot rat of Ganesha, the peacock of Skanda, the elephant Airavata of Indra, the parrot of Kama, the owl of Lakshmi, and the lion of Parvati.
