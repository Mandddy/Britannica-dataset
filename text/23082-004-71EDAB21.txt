Otis Redding,  (born Sept. 9, 1941, Dawson, Ga., U.S.—died Dec. 10, 1967, near Madison, Wis.) American singer-songwriter, one of the great soul stylists of the 1960s. Redding was raised in Macon, Georgia, where he was deeply influenced by the subtle grace of Sam Cooke and the raw energy of Little Richard. In the late 1950s Redding joined Richard’s band, the Upsetters, after Richard had gone solo. It was as a Little Richard imitator that Redding experienced his first minor hit, “Shout Bamalama,” for the Confederate label of Athens, Georgia.
The story of Redding’s breakthrough is part of soul music mythology. Redding joined Johnny Jenkins’s Pinetoppers, a local Georgia band, and also served as the group’s driver. When the group traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to record at the famed Stax studios, Redding sang two songs of his own at the end of the session. One of the two, “These Arms of Mine” (1962), launched his career, attracting both a record label executive (Jim Stewart) and a manager (Phil Walden) who passionately believed in his talent.
