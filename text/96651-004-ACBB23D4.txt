Portland, city, seat (1854) of Multnomah county, northwestern Oregon, U.S. The state’s largest city, it lies just south of Vancouver, Washington, on the Willamette River near its confluence with the Columbia River, about 100 miles (160 km) by river from the Pacific Ocean. Portland is the focus of a large surrounding urban area that, in addition to Vancouver, includes such Oregon cities as Beaverton and Gresham. Inc. 1851. Pop. (2000) 529,121; Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro Metro Area, 1,927,881; (2010) 583,776; Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro Metro Area, 2,226,009.
The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed near the site on the Columbia River in 1805–06. The city was laid out in 1845 and, after two of its early citizens flipped a penny, was named for Portland, Maine, rather than Boston, Massachusetts. Early growth was stimulated by a number of gold rushes and the flow of immigrants along the Oregon Trail. Portland attracted a large population of Chinese immigrants. The city’s area grew in the 1890s when it annexed surrounding communities, and the 1905 exposition celebrating the 100th anniversary of Lewis’s and Clark’s arrival brought the city national attention. Portland’s position at the junction of the Columbia River and the main north-south route from California to Puget Sound made it a valuable commercial centre handling the farm and forest produce of the Cascade Range, Willamette River valley, and Columbia River basin. The construction of deepwater port facilities capable of harbouring oceangoing vessels, the completion of the Northern Pacific transcontinental railroad, and the introduction of cheap hydroelectric power encouraged industry, and during World War II Portland was a major shipbuilding centre. Successful urban revitalization programs were undertaken in the 1970s and ’80s.
