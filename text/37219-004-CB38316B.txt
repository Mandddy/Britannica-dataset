Valery-Nicolas Larbaud,  (born Aug. 29, 1881, Vichy, Fr.—died  Feb. 2, 1957, Vichy) French novelist and critic, an erudite cosmopolitan who became a literary intermediary between France and Europe, especially England and Spanish-speaking countries.
Larbaud’s personal fortune permitted him a life of travel and leisure. His novels and stories are largely based on personal experiences: Fermina Marquez (1911), a novel of adolescence, deals with the effects of the visit of a beautiful South American girl to a boys’ school; A.O. Barnabooth (1913; Eng. trans., 1924) is the journal and verse of a South American millionaire—Larbaud’s alter ego—a cultivated, sensuous adventurer, whose haunts are international sleeping cars and luxury hotels. Enfantines (1918) is a collection of nostalgic childhood reminiscences, and Amants, heureux amants (1923), dealing with men and women in love, uses the interior-monologue technique developed by the Irish novelist James Joyce. Larbaud’s other works comprise essays and reflections inspired by his travels, such as Jaune, bleu, blanc (1927; “Yellow, Blue, White”) and Aux couleurs de Rome (1938). His translations include works of the 17th-century English miscellaneous prose writer Sir Thomas Browne, the 19th-century English novelist Samuel Butler, the U.S. poet Walt Whitman, and James Joyce. He also wrote two volumes of criticism of English and French literature, Ce Vice impuni, la lecture (1925) and Ce Vice impuni, domaine français (1941). In 1952 Larbaud received the Grand Prix National des Lettres.
