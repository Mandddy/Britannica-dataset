Snowy River, river, southeastern New South Wales and eastern Victoria, Australia, rising on the eastern slopes of the Snowy Mountains near Mount Kosciuszko and flowing about 270 miles (435 km) southeast, then west and south to Bass Strait at Marlo. Its chief tributaries are the Eucumbene, Thredbo, and Bombala rivers in New South Wales and the Buchan in Victoria.
Fed by melting snows, the river plays a major role in the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme, one of the world’s largest power and irrigation projects. Its waters are impounded at a high elevation, diverted through tunnels under the Australian Alps to generate electricity, and then discharged into the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. Immensely inspiring for the ambitious young country during the years following World War II, the project was viewed more critically with the rise of environmentalism in the closing decades of the 20th century, when it was strongly proposed to return some of the Snowy’s natural flow to the river.
