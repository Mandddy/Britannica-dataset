Bollworm, any larvae of various moths (order Lepidoptera), including the pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella, family Gelechiidae) and some Helicoverpa species. While these larvae are mostly known for the damage they inflict on cotton bolls, a variety of plants are attacked by bollworms, including peas, alfalfa, beans, soybeans, flax, peanuts, and other commercial crops. The larvae of the corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea, family Noctuidae) generally feed on corn kernels but can also burrow into tomatoes and cotton bolls and are thus sometimes known as tomato fruitworms or cotton bollworms. Bollworm pests can be managed using biological control methods, such as natural parasites, or through early crop planting, trap crops, and insecticides.
