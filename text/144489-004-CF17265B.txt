Nikolay Ryzhkov, in full Nikolay Ivanovich Ryzhkov   (born Sept. 28, 1929) premier of the Soviet Union from 1985 to 1991.
Little is known with certainty of Ryzhkovâ€™s early career. He seems to have begun his working career as a miner and then, by 1950, was a shift foreman at the Ordzhonikidze Uralmash plant (for heavy machinery) in the Urals, later rising to positions of shop superintendent and deputy manager. In 1956 he joined the Communist Party, and in 1959 he graduated from the S.M. Kirov Urals Polytechnic Institute, which led to his becoming chief engineer of the Uralmash plant in 1965 and finally, in 1970, director-general of the Uralmash Production Amalgamation.
