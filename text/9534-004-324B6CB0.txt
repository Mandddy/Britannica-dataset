Salamanca, city, capital of Salamanca provincia (province), in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Castile-León, western Spain. The city lies at an elevation of 2,552 feet (778 metres) above sea level on the north bank of the Tormes River. It is one of Spain’s greatest historical and artistic cities.
As an important Iberian settlement, it was ravaged by the Carthaginian general Hannibal in 217 bc. A Roman town grew up there because Salamanca (Salmantica) and its bridge were on the “Silver Road” from Astorga to Sevilla. It became a bishopric in the 7th century, though during the Moorish occupation the bishop lived in Oviedo. From the 8th to the 11th century, the city was in the area of warfare between Christians and Moors. The Christian repopulation took place from 1087 to 1102. In 1178 Ferdinand II of Leon held his Cortes (parliament) there and granted a special fuero (charter of privileges) to the city, which was by then the second in his kingdom. The University of Salamanca originated under Alfonso IX in 1218. St. Teresa of Ávila founded a Carmelite convent in the city in 1570. In the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) Gen. Francisco Franco took up residence in the episcopal palace in Salamanca.
