Itzhak Perlman,  (born August 31, 1945, Tel Aviv, Palestine [now Tel Aviv–Yafo, Israel]) Israeli-American violinist known for his brilliant virtuoso technique. His refinement of detail led many to regard him as one of the finest performers of the major violin repertoire of his time.
Perlman contracted polio at age four, which left his legs paralyzed. His first public concert was in Tel Aviv when he was 10. In 1958 he went to the United States to study at the Juilliard School in New York City with the renowned teachers Ivan Galamian and Dorothy DeLay; in that same year he performed before a national television audience on the Ed Sullivan Show. He made his Carnegie Hall (New York City) debut in 1963 and won the prestigious Leventritt Prize a year later, which brought him immediate engagements with major American orchestras. (The Leventritt Foundation awarded its violin and piano prizes only sporadically; the rarity of the prize and the value of the guaranteed engagements that came with it separated the Leventritt from other competitions.) As well as performing virtually the entire classical concert repertoire, he occasionally played with klezmer (traditional Jewish dance music) and jazz groups. He also played the solo violin passages in John Williams’s Oscar-winning score for the movie Schindler’s List (1993).
