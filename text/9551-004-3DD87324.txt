Sagittarius, (
        Latin: “Archer”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation in the southern sky lying between Capricornus and Scorpius, at about 19 hours right ascension and 25° south declination. The centre of the Milky Way Galaxy lies in the radio source Sagittarius A*. Near the western border of Sagittarius is the winter solstice, the southernmost point reached by the Sun in its apparent annual journey among the stars. This constellation also contains the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas. The brightest star is Kaus Australis (from the Arabic for “bow” and the Latin for “southern,” respectively; it is also called Epsilon Sagittarii), with a magnitude of 1.9. Many of the stars are arranged in the prominent asterism called the Teapot.
In astrology, Sagittarius is the ninth sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about November 22 to about December 21. It is represented either by a centaur shooting a bow and arrow or by an arrow drawn across a bow. The identification of Sagittarius as a mounted archer was made by the Babylonians as early as the 11th century bce.
