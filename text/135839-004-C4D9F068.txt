Gypsum plaster, white cementing material made by partial or complete dehydration of the mineral gypsum, commonly with special retarders or hardeners added. Applied in a plastic state (with water), it sets and hardens by chemical recombination of the gypsum with water.
For especially hard finish plaster, the gypsum is completely dehydrated at high temperature, and such chemicals as alkali sulfate, alum, or borax are added. Hair or fibre and lime or clay may be added to the plasters during manufacture. The plaster coats, except for some finish coats, are sanded. See also plaster of paris.
