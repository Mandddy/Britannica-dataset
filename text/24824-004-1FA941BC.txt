Horseshoe bat (genus Rhinolophus), any of almost 80 species of large-eared, insect-eating bats that make up the sole genus of family Rhinolophidae. Their taxonomic name refers to the large, complex nose leaf consisting of a fleshy structure on the muzzle. Of the three “leaf” sections, one resembles a horseshoe, hence their common name. The exact function of these facial appurtenances has yet to be determined, but scientists believe they may help to direct outgoing echolocation calls.
Horseshoe bats are found in tropical and temperate regions from Europe to Japan and from Asia to Africa. They are usually brown but occasionally are red. They are about 3.5–11 cm (1.4–4.3 inches) long without the 2.5–4.5-cm (1–1.8-inch) tail, and they weigh 5–30 grams (0.17–1 ounce). Horseshoe bats live in groups and roost in damp, dark places such as caves. Species native to temperate regions hibernate in winter.
