Margaret Murie, also called Mardy Murie, neé Margaret Thomas  (born August 18, 1902, Seattle, Washington, U.S.—died October 19, 2003, Moose, Wyoming) American naturalist, conservationist, and writer who was a central contributor in efforts to establish the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, which earned her the popular title “grandmother of the conservation movement.”
When Murie was a young girl, her family moved from Seattle to Fairbanks, Alaska, where her stepfather had been appointed an assistant U.S. attorney. In 1924 she became the first woman to graduate from the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines (now the University of Alaska, Fairbanks), earning a degree in business administration. She married Olaus Murie that same year. Olaus was then working for the U.S. Bureau of Biological Survey (from 1940 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) in Fairbanks, and Mardy, as she was known to her friends and family, joined him on a 550-mile (885-km), eight-month-long expedition to study caribou in Alaska’s Brooks Range, a journey they often referred to as their honeymoon.
