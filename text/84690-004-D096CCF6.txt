Romeo and Juliet, American film drama, released in 1968, that was an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s famous tragedy of the same name. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, it is often lauded as the best take on the oft-filmed classic.
Until this version of Shakespeare’s tragic romance, the actors who played the title lovers were often too old to plausibly portray the characters. Refreshingly, Zeffirelli gave the roles to young, inexperienced actors Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, who at the time of filming were ages 15 and 17, respectively. The acclaimed director provided his trademark sweeping production design, emulating the actual societal conditions in which the story takes place. His version resonates with a realism that previous film versions lack.
