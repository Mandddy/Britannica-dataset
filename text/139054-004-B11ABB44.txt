Text messaging, also called texting,  act of sending short messages with cell phones using the Short Messaging Service (SMS), which has a limit of 160 characters per message.
SMS was developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s, and the first text message was sent on December 3, 1992. An SMS commercial service was launched in the United Kingdom in 1995. Text messaging did not take off, however, until it became possible to send messages between the four main British cell phone networks in 1998. The number of messages sent in the United Kingdom grew from one billion in 1999 to some 30 billion in 2005. In the United States text messaging emerged later but expanded rapidly. From 30 million messages sent in the United States in June 2001, the monthly traffic grew to about 7.3 billion in 2005 and 14 billion in 2008. Worldwide, the number of text messages sent each year is approaching one trillion, and the major wireless companies report that users now do more texting than talking on their cell phones.
