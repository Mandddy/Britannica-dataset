Histosol, one of the 30 soil groups in the classification system of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Histosols are low-density, acidic soils with a high proportion of organic material. Formed mainly in cold climates and under waterlogged conditions, they are the most common soil in northern Finland, in western Scotland, in central Canada, and east of the Urals in Russia. They also occur in the bogs and swamps of Ireland, Angola, Bangladesh, and Guyana. Histosols are estimated to cover just over 2.5 percent of the continental land area on Earth, 80 percent of this in cold or boreal climatic zones. Their agricultural use is limited by cold climate, waterlogging, and low fertility.
Histosols are technically characterized by organic materials whose cumulative thickness makes up at least half of the upper 80 cm (about 2 feet) of the soil profile. They are identified as fibric if the organic materials show little or no decomposition and as terric if the organic materials are highly decomposed, dark in colour, and not conducive to drainage. They are similar in all respects to the Histosol order of the U.S. Soil Taxonomy.
