Tharu, people of the Tarai region of the Himalayan foothills, located in southern Nepal and in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. In the early 21st century the Tharu in Nepal officially numbered about 1.5 million and those in India about 170,000. They speak various dialects of Tharu, a language of the Indo-Aryan subgroup of the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European family, and they are largely Indian in culture. Most Tharu practice agriculture, raise cattle, hunt, fish, and collect forest products. The five higher clans among them, which constitute the great majority of the population, claim to be of royal origin from Rajasthan. Although they are Hindu, the Tharu use their own traditional ritual specialists in addition to the Hindu Brahman priests; moreover, many consume alcoholic beverages and some eat beef. Despite their patrilineal social system, women have property rights greatly exceeding those recognized in Hindu society. Each village is governed by a council and a headman.
