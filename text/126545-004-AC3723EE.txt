Nastia Liukin, in full Anastasiya Valeryevna Liukin, original name Anastasiya Valeryevna Lyukina  (born October 30, 1989, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) American gymnast who won five medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, more than any other gymnast at the Games.
Liukin was born into a family of extraordinary gymnasts. Her Kazakh-born father and coach, Valery Lyukin, won four medals for the Soviet Union at the 1988 Olympic Games and two more at the 1991 world championships, and in 1987 he became the first gymnast to complete a triple back somersault on the floor exercise. Her mother, Anna Kochneva, also competed for the Soviet Union and was the 1987 rhythmic gymnastics world champion in clubs. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991), Lyukin moved his family to the United States, where he cofounded the World Olympic Gymnastics Academy (WOGA) in Plano, Texas. (The family Anglicized their name to Liukin when they became U.S. citizens.) Liukinâ€™s parents initially objected to her early interest in gymnastics, but she soon became known for her stylish grace and the long lines in her gymnastics moves, which she made look effortless.
