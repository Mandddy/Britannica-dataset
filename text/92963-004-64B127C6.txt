Donna de Varona,  (born April 26, 1947, San Diego, Calif. U.S.) American athlete and sportscaster who, after a record-breaking amateur career as a swimmer, established herself as an advocate for women’s and girls’ sports opportunities.
De Varona became a household word among Olympic Games enthusiasts in 1960 when, at age 13, she became the youngest member of the U.S. swimming team at the Rome Olympics. Four years later, at the Tokyo Olympics, she won two gold medals—in the 400-metre individual medley and in the 4 × 100-metre freestyle relay—and by age 17 she had broken 18 world records in swimming.
