Qaṣr ʿAmrah, also spelled Qaṣr Al-ʿamrah,  palace in Jordan, about 50 miles (80 km) east of Amman. Built about ad 712–715, it served as both a hunting lodge and a fortress, and it is one of the best-preserved monuments of Islāmic architecture from the Umayyad period. Its main chamber is roofed with three parallel vaults that rest on broad arches. The vaults are covered with frescoes of people and animals in scenes from daily life; a grouping of rulers and a caliph, thought to be al-Walīd I; and a zodiac. A complete bath forms part of the complex.
