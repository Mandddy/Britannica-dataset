River Ribble, river in North Yorkshire and Lancashire, England, formed by the confluence of the Gayle and Cam becks (streams). The river first flows almost due south between Ingleborough Mountain (2,373 feet [723 m]) and Pen-y-Ghent (2,273 feet [693 m]) and then through open country, a long gorge, and a wide valley (devoted mostly to pastoral farming) until it is joined by its two main tributaries, the Hodder from the north and the Calder. The Ribble then meanders between bluffs that rise 150 feet (46 m) high a mile apart on either side of the floodplain. Preston lies on the northern side at the lowest bridge point. The channel to the Irish Sea coast, 12 miles (19 km) away, has been straightened to provide a shipping lane to Preston. The Ribble is 75 miles (120 km) long.
