Ambroise Paré,  (born 1510, Bourg-Hersent, France—died  Dec. 20, 1590, Paris) French physician, one of the most notable surgeons of the European Renaissance, regarded by some medical historians as the father of modern surgery.
About 1533 Paré went to Paris, where he soon became a barber-surgeon apprentice at the Hôtel-Dieu. He was taught anatomy and surgery and in 1537 was employed as an army surgeon. By 1552 he had gained such popularity that he became surgeon to the king; he served four French monarchs: Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III.
