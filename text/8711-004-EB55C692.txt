Wren-warbler,  any of a number of Old World warblers, family Sylviidae (order Passeriformes), that are wrenlike in carrying their tails cocked up. The name also denotes certain birds of the family Maluridae that are found in Australia and New Zealand. Among the sylviid wren-warblers are those of the African genus Calamonastes (sometimes included in Camaroptera), in which the tail is rather long and the underparts are barred. An example is the barred wren-warbler (C. fasciolatus) of south-central Africa, which sews its nest like a tailorbird.
