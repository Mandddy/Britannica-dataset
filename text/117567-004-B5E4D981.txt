Lorelei, German Loreley,  large rock on the bank at a narrows of the Rhine River near Sankt Goarshausen, Germany. The rock produces an echo and is associated with the legend of a beautiful maiden who threw herself into the Rhine in despair over a faithless lover and was transformed into a siren who lured fishermen to destruction. The essentials of the legend were claimed as his invention by German writer Clemens Brentano in his novel Godwi (1800â€“02). Lorelei has been the subject of a number of literary works and songs; the poem Die Loreley by Heinrich Heine was set to music by more than 25 composers.
