Laramide orogeny, a series of mountain-building events that affected much of western North America in Late Cretaceous and Paleogene time. (The Cretaceous Period ended 65.5 million years ago and was followed by the Paleogene Period.) Evidence of the Laramide orogeny is present from Mexico to Alaska, but the main effects appear centred in the eastern portion of the Cordilleran Geosynclinefrom southern Nevada to the Northern Rockies and Northern Cordillera in western Canada, in the Central Rockies of Montana and Wyoming, in the Southern Rockies of Colorado and New Mexico, and in southern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern Mexico.
The evidence consists of great eastward-directed thrust faults and folds with only slight basement involvement in the eastern portion of the Cordilleran Geosyncline from Nevada northward to British Columbia; initial vertical uplift accompanied by the development of flanking, coarse clastic basin sediments and unconformities in the Central and Southern Rockies; and acidic plutonic intrusions ranging from 50 million to 70 million years in age that are much smaller in bulk than those that accompanied the Nevadan orogeny, with the exception of the portion in southern Arizona.
