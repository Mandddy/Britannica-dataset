Philippe Aubert de Gaspé,  (born Oct. 30, 1786, Quebec, Que. [now in Canada]—died  Jan. 29, 1871, Quebec) author of the early French Canadian novel Les Anciens Canadiens (1863), which strongly influenced later regionalist writers in Canada.
The son of a distinguished Quebec family, Gaspé inherited the family estate on the St. Lawrence River. He received a classical education in Quebec, studied law there, and later became sheriff. Bankruptcy, for which he spent over three years in debtors’ prison, forced his withdrawal from public life in his 40s into a quiet life of reading and meditation.
