Shabbetai Tzevi, also spelled Sabbatai Zebi or Sabbatai Zevi  (born July 23, 1626, Smyrna, Ottoman Empire [now İzmir, Turkey]—died 1676, Ulcinj, Ottoman Empire [now in Montenegro]) a false messiah who developed a mass following and threatened rabbinical authority in Europe and the Middle East.
As a young man, Shabbetai steeped himself in the influential body of Jewish mystical writings known as the Kabbala. His extended periods of ecstasy and his strong personality combined to attract many disciples, and at the age of 22 he proclaimed himself the messiah.
