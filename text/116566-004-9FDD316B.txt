Tobogganing, the sport of sliding down snow-covered slopes and artificial-ice-covered chutes on a runnerless sled called a toboggan. In Europe, small sleds with runners are also called toboggans (see lugeing; skeleton sledding).
The runnerless toboggan was originally an American Indian sled made of poles tied together with thongs. The modern version is usually built of thin, straight-grained boards of hickory, birch, or oak fastened together by light crosspieces. Some are made of metal or laminated wood. The front end is bent up and back to form the hood and is braced by rope or leather thongs. The flat sliding surface is generally about 18 inches (45 cm) wide and from 4 to 9 feet (1.2 to 2.7 m) long. The toboggan is light in weight and will support a heavy load on soft snow. It is well adapted to sliding down open slopes, where its large surface rides easily on loose, fluffy snow. Several persons can ride at one time, either lying prone or in a sitting position. The toboggan can be steered by lifting and twisting the front or by dragging a foot in the snow. It is also useful for hauling loads over wilderness trails or cross-country as well as for sport.
