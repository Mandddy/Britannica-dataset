Julian Schnabel,  (born October 26, 1951, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American painter, printmaker, sculptor, and filmmaker who became an instant art-world success when he was marketed by the young New York dealer Mary Boone. He was one of a number of international painters—including David Salle in the United States, Georg Baselitz in Germany, and Francesco Clemente in Italy—to emerge in the late 1970s whose bold expressive style was termed Neo-Expressionist.
Schnabel was known for culling imagery from a variety of sources, from both fine art and popular culture, in keeping with the emerging postmodern practice of denying authorial originality and intent through acts of appropriation. Schnabel’s art in particular was characterized by its chaotic profusion of styles and sources. He often painted on velvet and applied such materials as broken crockery. He was a bigger-than-life figure in the thriving art-star scene and, with the marketing help of Boone, his first one-person show in New York (1979) was sold out before it even opened. He was 29 years old.
