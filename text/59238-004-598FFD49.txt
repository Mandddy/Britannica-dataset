Maceral, any of the numerous microscopically recognizable, individual organic constituents of coal with characteristic physical and chemical properties. Macerals are analogous to minerals in inorganic rocks, but they lack a definite crystalline structure. Macerals are coalified plant remains preserved in coal and other rocks. They change progressively, both chemically and physically, as the rank of coal increases. (Coal rank is a measure of a coalâ€™s degree of metamorphism expressed as its position in the lignite-to-anthracite series and is primarily based on decreasing volatile matter content and increasing carbon content.)Petrologic components (macerals) in coal and their groupings        maceral grouping in Europe macerals maceral grouping in the United States    name in Europe* name in the United States**    vitrinite telinite megascopic anthraxylon attrital anthraxylon anthraxylon    collinite subanthraxylon humic matter light brown matter translucent attritus   liptinite*** resinite red resins yellow resins     cerinite amorphous wax     sporinite (exinite) spore coats     cutinite cuticles     suberinite suberin     alginite algal bodies    inertinite massive micrinite dark brown matter amorphous opaque matter opaque attritus    granular micrinite granular opaque matter     sclerotinite fusinized fungal matter petrologic fusain    semifusinite dark semifusain     fusinite attrital fusain     megascopic fusain     *The majority of these names originated with M.C.

Macerals are classified into three major groups: vitrinite, inertinite, and liptinite (formerly called exinite). Vitrinite is derived from cell walls and woody plant tissue and includes the macerals telinite and collinite. Most coals contain a high percentage (50 to 90 percent) of vitrinites. Inertinites, a group thought to have formed from plant material transformed by severe degradation during the peat stage of coalification, include fusinite, semi-fusinite, micrinite, macrinite, and sclerotinite. Inertinites are rich in carbon. Most coals contain 5 to 40 percent inertinites. The liptinite macerals, which are characterized by a high hydrogen content and derived from the cuticles and resinous parts of plants, include sporinite, cutinite, resinite, and alginite. Most coals contain 5 to 15 percent liptinites.
