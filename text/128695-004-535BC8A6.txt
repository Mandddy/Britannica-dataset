Cell phone, in full cellular telephone,  wireless telephone that permits telecommunication within a defined area that may include hundreds of square miles, using radio waves in the 800â€“900 megahertz (MHz) band. To implement a cell-phone system, a geographic area is broken into smaller areas, or cells, usually mapped as uniform hexagrams but in fact overlapping and irregularly shaped. Each cell is equipped with a low-powered radio transmitter and receiver that permit propagation of signals between cell-phone users. See also mobile telephone.
