Brian De Palma, in full Brian Russell De Palma, De Palma sometimes spelled DePalma  (born September 11, 1940, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.) American motion-picture director and screenwriter best noted for his usually stylish, often graphic horror-suspense films that draw heavily on the work of director Alfred Hitchcock.
De Palma, who was the son of a surgeon, became interested in movies during college. After receiving a B.A. from Columbia University in New York City (1962), he accepted a theatre fellowship at Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York (M.A., 1964). While there he codirected (with Wilford Leach and Cynthia Monroe) the feature-length film The Wedding Party (1964; released 1969). The comedy featured early career performances by Robert De Niro and Jill Clayburgh. De Palma’s first solo features were Murder à la Mod (1968) and Greetings (1968), the latter of which was set in Greenwich Village and starred De Niro.
