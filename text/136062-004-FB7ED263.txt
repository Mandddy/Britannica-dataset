Chrome, an open-source Internet browser released by Google, Inc., a major American search engine company, in 2008.
The first beta version of the software was released on Sept. 2, 2008, for personal computers (PCs) running various versions of Microsoft Corporation’s Windows OS (operating system). The development of Chrome was kept a well-guarded secret until a Web-based “comic book” describing the browser was released just hours before links appeared on Google’s Web site to download the program. In its public statements the company declared that it did not expect to supplant the major browsers, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Firefox (the latter an open-source browser that Google supports with technical and monetary help). Instead, Google stated that its goal was to advance the usefulness of the Internet by including features that would work better with newer Web-based technologies, such as the company’s Google Apps (e.g., calendar, word processor, spreadsheet), that operate within a browser. This concept is often called “cloud computing,” as the user relies on programs operating “out there,” somewhere “in the cloud” (on the Internet).
