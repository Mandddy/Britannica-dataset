Apgar Score System, also called Apgar Score,  medical rating procedure developed in 1952 by American anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to evaluate the condition of newborn infants and to identify those that require life-sustaining medical assistance, such as resuscitation. The Apgar score is a qualitative measurement of a newborn’s success in adapting to the environment outside the uterus.
A newborn infant is evaluated one minute and five minutes after birth. Five signs are assessed: heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and skin colour. Medical students memorize these signs by using the mnemonic of Apgar’s name: appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration. A score of 0, 1, or 2 is assigned to each component. Usually, the higher the total score, with 10 being the maximum, the better the infant’s condition. If the infant’s total score is less than 7, it is reevaluated every 5 minutes until 20 minutes have passed or until two successive scores of 7 or greater are obtained.
