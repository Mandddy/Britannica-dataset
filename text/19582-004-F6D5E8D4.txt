Jeannette Rankin,  (born June 11, 1880, near Missoula, Montana, U.S.—died May 18, 1973, Carmel, California) first woman member of the U.S. Congress (1917–19, 1941–43), a vigorous feminist and a lifetime pacifist and crusader for social and electoral reform.
Rankin graduated from the University of Montana in 1902. She subsequently attended the New York School of Philanthropy (later the New York, then the Columbia, School of Social Work) before embarking on a career of social work in Seattle, Washington, in 1909. Caught up in the rising tide of sentiment for woman suffrage, she campaigned effectively for the next five years in Washington, California, and Montana on behalf of the cause. In 1914 she became legislative secretary of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, and in that same year she led a successful campaign for woman suffrage in her native Montana.
