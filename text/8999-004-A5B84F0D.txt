Zacharias Topelius,  (born Jan. 14, 1818, Kuddnäs, Russian Finland—died  March 12, 1898, Helsinki) the father of the Finnish historical novel. His works, written in Swedish, are classics of Finland’s national literature.
Topelius joined the faculty of the University of Helsinki as professor of Finnish history in 1864; he served as university president, 1875–78. Though he published five collections of lyrics, he is best known for Fältskärns berättelser (1853–67; The King’s Ring and the Surgeon’s Stories, 1872), a romanticized account of Swedish–Finnish history during the 17th and 18th centuries. In later years he wrote stories based on Finnish folktales and fairy tales for children. All his works have been translated into Finnish.
