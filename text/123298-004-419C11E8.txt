Qingdao, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’ing-tao, conventional Tsingtao,  port city, eastern Shandong sheng (province), eastern China. It is located on the south coast of the Shandong Peninsula at the eastern entrance to Jiaozhou (Kiaochow) Bay, one of the best natural harbours in northern China. Although the bay sometimes freezes in severe winters, it is always open for large ships.
Originally a minor fishing village, Qingdao developed a large junk trade in Qing times (1644–1911/12), when a customs station was established there. With the establishment of the Beiyang (“North Ocean”) fleet in the 1880s, the Chinese government realized the strategic importance of Qingdao (at the time known as Jiao’ao) and set up a minor naval station and building fortifications there. In 1897 the German government, which had ambitions in this area, dispatched a force to occupy Qingdao; the next year it forced the Chinese government to pay an indemnity and to grant Germany a 99-year lease on Jiaozhou Bay and the surrounding territory, together with railway and mining rights in Shandong. Qingdao was declared a free port in 1899, and modern port facilities were installed; a railway was built to Jinan in 1904. A modern European-style city was laid out, and a variety of industries were founded. A branch of the Imperial Maritime Customs was established to control the trade of the coast as far south as the new port of Lianyungang in Jiangsu province. In 1914, when Japan declared war on Germany, its prime purpose was the capture of Qingdao; the port capitulated after a blockade in November. The Japanese continued to occupy the city until the Washington Conference of 1922, when the port was returned to China. During that period, however, the Japanese had built up a strong position, both in Qingdao itself and in the Shandong hinterland.
