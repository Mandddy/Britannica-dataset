Reba McEntire, in full Reba Nell McEntire  (born March 28, 1955, McAlester, Oklahoma, U.S.) American singer and actress, one of the most popular female country vocal artists of the late 20th century, who later found crossover success as a television star.
As the daughter of a world champion steer roper, McEntire spent time during her childhood traveling between rodeo performances. On the trips, her mother helped nurture her musical abilities, and McEntire formed a band with her siblings while in the ninth grade. She scored her first big break when she was asked to sing the national anthem at the 1974 National Finals Rodeo. Her performance impressed country music star Red Steagall, who helped McEntire record a demo that led to a contract with Mercury Records. Although neither her first single, “I Don’t Want to Be a One Night Stand” (1976), nor her self-titled debut album (1977) found an immediate audience, she continued to record, and she eventually topped the Billboard country singles chart with “Can’t Even Get the Blues” (1982). Other hits followed, but McEntire longed to have more control of her own career and to recapture a more traditional country music sound. She moved to the MCA label in 1984, started coproducing her recordings, and, with albums such as Whoever’s in New England (1986), managed to attain steady commercial success. By the end of 1986 she had topped the country singles chart for the seventh time. At the Country Music Association (CMA) Awards, she was crowned best female vocalist in an unprecedented four consecutive years (1984–87).
