False arborvitae, also called Hiba Arborvitae,   (Thujopsis dolabrata), ornamental and timber evergreen tree or shrub of the cypress family (Cupressaceae), native to Japan. It is closely related to the arborvitae but has larger leaves, marked on the underside with depressed white bands. The trees are often 35 metres (115 feet) tall.
False arborvitae wood is yellowish white, soft, elastic, and very durable; it has been used for boatbuilding. Many shrubby and dwarf varieties have been developed for ornamental use.
