Theodore M. Hesburgh, in full Theodore Martin Hesburgh  (born May 25, 1917, Syracuse, New York, U.S.—died February 26, 2015, South Bend, Indiana) American Roman Catholic priest and educator under whose presidency (1952–87) the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, became as respected for its academic record as for its athletic one and who achieved national prominence through his public service work.
Hesburgh, who said he knew from early childhood that he wanted to be a priest, joined the Order of the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1934. He was ordained a priest in 1943, and in 1945 he was assigned to teach religion and serve as chaplain at Notre Dame. He was promoted to head of the department of religion in 1948, executive vice president of the university in 1949, and president in 1952. As president, a post he held until his retirement in 1987, Hesburgh liberalized the rules regulating student life, promoted academic freedom, and worked toward making Notre Dame one of the top universities in the country, doubling its enrollment and greatly increasing its endowment. In addition, he transferred its governance (1967) from the Congregation of the Holy Cross to a mixed lay and religious board and oversaw the admittance of women students in 1972.
