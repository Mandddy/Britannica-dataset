Amilcare Ponchielli,  (born August 31 or September 1, 1834, Paderno Fasolaro, near Cremona, Lombardy [Italy]—died January 16, 1886, Milan, Italy) Italian composer, best known for his opera La gioconda (“The Joyful Girl”).
Ponchielli studied at Milan and produced his first opera, I promessi sposi (“The Betrothed”; based on the novel by Alessandro Manzoni), in 1856; its revised version was popular in Italy and abroad. Between 1873 and 1875 he wrote two ballets and four operas. La gioconda (1876), with a libretto by Arrigo Boito based on Victor Hugo’s Angelo, tyran de Padoue (1835; “Angelo, Tyrant of Padua”), achieved wide success. Later it was remembered chiefly for its ballet, Dance of the Hours, but it returned to the repertory of Italian opera houses in the 1950s. From 1881 to 1886 Ponchielli was music director at Bergamo Cathedral; there he wrote several sacred works.
