Reanimation rite, in Egyptian religion, rite to prepare the deceased for the afterlife, performed on statues of the deceased, the mummy itself, or statues of a god located in a temple. An important element of the ceremony was the ritual “Opening of the Mouth” so the mummy might breathe and eat. The rite, which symbolized the death and regeneration concept of the Osiris myth (in which the dismembered god Osiris was pieced together again and infused with life), was performed in the sculptor’s workshop if on a statue, but on a mummy it was performed at the tomb entrance. By this rite the statue or mummy was believed to be endowed with life and power so that he might enjoy the daily funeral service conducted before his tomb. In the case of temple statues, the ceremony was included in the daily temple ritual.
