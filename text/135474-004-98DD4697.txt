Niceto Alcalá Zamora,  (born July 6, 1877, Priego, Spain—died  Feb. 18, 1949, Buenos Aires) Spanish statesman, prime minister, and president of the Second Republic (1931–36), whose attempts to moderate the policies of the various factions led eventually to his deposition and exile.
Elected to the Cortes (parliament) in 1905, Alcalá Zamora became minister of works in 1917 and minister of war in 1922. The Spanish defeat at Anual in Morocco led to an enquiry, as a result of which Gen. Primo de Rivera seized power, dissolved parliament, suppressed the report, and concluded the war. Alcalá Zamora blamed King Alfonso XIII for the dictatorship and became a republican, joining the socialists and Catalan left in the Pact of San Sebastián (August 1930). As leader of the revolutionary committee, he successfully demanded Alfonso’s abdication on the basis of the municipal elections of April 1931. Alfonso left Spain, and Alcalá Zamora went from prison to become prime minister. He resigned on Oct. 14, 1931, however, when the Cortes included strongly anticlerical articles in the new constitution. Nevertheless, on December 11 he was elected the first president of the Second Republic.
