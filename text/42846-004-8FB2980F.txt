Museum of Decorative Arts, German Kunstgewerbemuseum,  museum in Berlin housing an important collection of applied arts and crafts. The museum, among the oldest of its kind in Germany, displays both historical and contemporary pieces.
The museum was founded in 1868 as the Deutsches-Gewerbe-Museum zu Berlin—the name by which it was known until 1879. After a series of moves and a temporary name change, in 1985 the main collection found its current home in a newly built structure in Berlin’s Kulturforum at Potsdamer Platz. In 2004 the museum opened a second site, located in the 17th-century Baroque Köpenick Palace.
