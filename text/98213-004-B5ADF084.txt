Ricky Ponting, in full Ricky Thomas Ponting, byname Punter  (born December 19, 1974, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia) Australian cricketer who was the country’s premier batsman in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Ponting gained a reputation as a cricket prodigy when he scored four centuries (a century is 100 runs in a single innings) for the Under-13s in a Tasmanian cricket week and two more when promoted to the Under-16 team. By age 20 he had made his Test (international match) debut and had been hailed by some as the new Don Bradman, who was considered by many the best cricketer of the 20th century. A maiden Test century came at Leeds on the 1997 tour of England. Ponting was criticized for his inconsistent performances early in his career (caused, in part, by off-field personal troubles), but, after rededicating himself to the sport, he became a key factor in Australia’s dominance in international cricket over the next decade.
