Oswald de Andrade, in full José Oswald De Sousa Andrade   (born Jan. 11, 1890, São Paulo, Brazil—died  Oct. 22, 1954, São Paulo) poet, playwright, and novelist, social agitator and revolutionary, one of the leaders of Brazil’s Modernist movement in the arts.
Born into a wealthy and aristocratic family, Andrade traveled extensively in Europe during his youth and there became aware of avant-garde literary trends in Paris and Italy. After his return to São Paulo, where he received his degree in law in 1919, he and Mário de Andrade (no relation) helped organize the Semana de Arte Moderna (“Week of Modern Art”) at São Paulo in 1922, to introduce the Modernist movement to the public.
