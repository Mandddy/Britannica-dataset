Friedrich Paulus,  (born September 23, 1890, Breitenau, Germany [now in Austria]—died February 1, 1957, Dresden, East Germany) German field marshal whose advance on Stalingrad (now Volgograd, Russia) in the summer and fall of 1942 represented the high-water mark of Nazi military expansion. Cut off by a Soviet counteroffensive and denied the option of retreat by German leader Adolf Hitler, Paulus was forced to surrender what was left of his army in early 1943, a defeat that became one of the turning points of World War II.
Paulus served as a junior officer in World War I and held the rank of captain upon the war’s conclusion. During the interwar years he demonstrated his talents as a staff officer, but superiors questioned his suitability as a field commander. By the time World War II began in September 1939, Paulus had been promoted to major general, serving as chief of staff to Gen. Walther von Reichenau. After participating in the blitzkrieg campaigns in Poland (1939) and the Low Countries (1940), Paulus was named deputy chief of the German General Staff under Gen. Franz Halder in September 1940. In that role, he helped draft plans for the invasion of the Soviet Union. After the initial German offensive stalled in the face of Russian resistance and the onset of winter, Hitler sacked Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of the German army group operating in the southern Soviet Union, and promoted Reichenau in his place. On Reichenau’s recommendation, and despite Paulus’s dearth of experience leading troops in the field, Paulus was promoted to general and given command of the Sixth Army in January 1942.
