Sir John Gielgud, in full Sir Arthur John Gielgud  (born April 14, 1904, London, England—died May 21, 2000, near Aylesbury) English actor, producer, and director, who is considered one of the greatest performers of his generation on stage and screen, particularly as a Shakespearean actor. He was knighted in 1953 for services to the theatre. (Click here to hear Gielgud reading from A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Tempest.)
Gielgud was the grandnephew of the celebrated English actress Ellen Terry. He was educated at Westminster School and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London, and made his acting debut in 1921 at the Old Vic Theatre, London, later playing Romeo at the Regent Theatre, London, in 1924. He made his first American appearance in New York City in 1928. After affiliations with the Oxford Playhouse, he joined the Old Vic company, for which his performance in 1929 as Hamlet established his reputation as one of England’s most promising actors. A series of impressive Shakespearean performances followed. His greatest early success was probably as Richard II in the play by that name, which he also directed.
