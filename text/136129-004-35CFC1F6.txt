Avoidance behaviour, type of activity, seen in animals exposed to adverse stimuli, in which the tendency to act defensively is stronger than the tendency to attack. The underlying implication that a single neural mechanism is involved (such as a specific part of the brain, which, under electrical stimulation, seems to inflict punishment) remains only a hypothesis. Clearly, the same kinds of avoidance behaviour might result from different underlying physiological mechanisms. Thus, although the various dichotomies, or polarities, of behaviour such as positive and negative, psychoanalytic life and death instincts, and approach and withdrawal concepts may be logical or philosophical conveniences, they seem, nevertheless, to lack clear meaning physiologically.
Alternative usage defines avoidance behaviour by describing a number of patterns: active avoidance (fleeing), passive avoidance (freezing stock-still or hiding), and a pattern of protective reflexes, as seen in the startle response. There is good reason to suppose that, in cats, for example, each of these patterns is coordinated separately by the brain. One kind of fleeing, in which the cat moves continuously and shows much upward climbing, is produced by electrical stimulation of specific parts of the brain (hypothalamic sites). Stimulation of other sites (in the thalamus) generates other types of fleeing movements, causing the animal to crouch, look around, move, slink close to the floor, and hide, if possible. In general, among birds and mammals, brain sites for fleeing of the first type occur in hypothalamic and mesencephalic zones.
