Úbeda, city, Jaén provincia (province), in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southern Spain. Úbeda lies northeast of the city of Jaén, on the Úbeda Hills in the Guadalimar Valley. Originally an Iberian settlement, the city was occupied by the Arabs in 711 ce and was reconquered by Ferdinand III of Castile in 1234. It is renowned for its architecture, particularly of the Renaissance period, which is reflected by the Sacra Capilla del Salvador (completed 1556 with a Classical facade), the Hospital de Santiago (begun in 1567 by Andrés de Vandelvira), and the Palacio del Condestable Dávalos (now a government hotel). Most of the city has been declared a national monument, and it, along with an architecturally comparable area in the neighbouring city of Baeza, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003.
Situated in a well-watered olive-growing region, Úbeda produces olive oil and olive-pressing equipment. Manufactures include plastics, pottery, esparto-grass mats, and forged metal products. St. John of the Cross died in the city. Pop. (2007 est.) mun., 34,347.
