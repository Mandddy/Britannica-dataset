Eskimo dog, also called Canadian Eskimo dog,  breed of sled and hunting dog found near the Arctic Circle. It is believed by some authorities to be representative of a pure breed some 10,000 years old and by others to be descended from wolves. The Eskimo dog is powerfully built and big-boned, resembling other sled dogs such as the Alaskan Malamute and the Siberian husky. Its long, waterproof outer coat is variable in colour and covers a thick, woolly undercoat. Like others of its type, it has prick ears and a tail that curls over its back. The Eskimo dog stands about 20 to 27 inches (51 to 68.5 cm) and usually weighs between 65 and 105 pounds (30 and 47.5 kg). The breed is not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), but the Canadian Kennel Club places it in the working-dog group.
The American Eskimo dog, a separate breed, is descended from the German spitz type. It is a strong, compactly built dog with an alert expression. Its thick, double coat is always white or white with biscuit. It carries its plumed tail over its back, and males especially have a thick ruff of long hair over the neck and chest. There are three size divisions: standard, up to 19 inches (48 cm); miniature, up to 15 inches (38 cm); and toy, up to 12 inches (30.5 cm). The American Eskimo dog was a popular circus dog in the early 20th century. The breed was recognized by the AKC in 1994 and is placed in the Non-Sporting group.
