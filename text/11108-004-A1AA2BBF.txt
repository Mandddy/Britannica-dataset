William Ernest Henley,  (born Aug. 23, 1849, Gloucester, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died  July 11, 1903, Woking, near London) British poet, critic, and editor who in his journals introduced the early work of many of the great English writers of the 1890s.
Son of a Gloucester bookseller and a pupil of the poet T.E. Brown, Henley contracted a tubercular disease that later necessitated the amputation of one foot. His other leg was saved only through the skill and radical new methods of the surgeon Joseph Lister, whom he sought out in Edinburgh. Forced to stay in an infirmary in Edinburgh for 20 months (1873–75), he began writing impressionistic poems (some in free verse) about hospital life that established his poetic reputation. Some of these were published in The Cornhill Magazine in 1875; the whole sequence appeared in A Book of Verses (1888). Dating from the same period is his most popular poem, “Invictus” (1875), which concludes with the lines “I am the master of my fate; / I am the captain of my soul.” Subsequent volumes of verse include London Voluntaries (1893), Poems (1898), Hawthorn and Lavender (1899), and For England’s Sake (1900).
