Trumpeter, also called trumpet bird,  any of three species of long-legged, round-bodied birds comprising the family Psophiidae (order Gruiformes). All are about 50 centimetres (20 inches) long, inhabit northern South America, and are named for their strident calls, uttered as they roam the jungle floor searching for berries and insects. Trumpeters are small-headed and thin-necked, with short, rounded wings, a short bill, and a characteristic hunched posture. Their plumage is dark, with lighter wing patches. Unwary, they are easily killed for their excellent flesh.
The most widespread species is the common, or gray-winged, trumpeter (Psophia crepitans). The others are the pale-winged, or white-winged, trumpeter (P. leucoptera), and the dark-winged, or green-winged, trumpeter (P. viridis), of Brazil.
