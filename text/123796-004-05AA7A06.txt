Carnallite,  a soft, white halide mineral, hydrated potassium and magnesium chloride (KMgCl3Â·6H2O), that is a source of potassium for fertilizers. Carnallite occurs with other chloride minerals in the upper layers of marine salt deposits, where it appears to be an alteration product of pre-existing salts. The mineral is found principally in the northern German salt deposits; and also in Spain, Tunisia, and the southwestern United States. For detailed physical properties, see halide mineral (table).
