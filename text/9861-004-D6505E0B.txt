Native cat,  any of the catlike Australian marsupials that make up the genus Dasyurus in the family Dasyuridae. All native cats are predators that hunt chiefly at night. Because they sometimes raid poultry yards, native cats have been persecuted and in some regions are extinct. Also contributing to their disappearance have been the destruction of their habitats and the introduction of such placental mammals as domestic cats, which compete with the native cats for food, and dogs and foxes, which prey on native cats.
Native cats have bushy tails and white-spotted upperparts. The eastern native cat (D. viverrinus, or D. quoll), surviving chiefly in the forests and open country of Tasmania, is 55 to 75 centimetres (22 to 30 inches) long, including its 20- to 30-cm tail. The western native cat (D. geoffroii) of the savannahs of southwestern and central Australia is almost the same size but has a relatively longer tail. The northern native cat (D. hallucatus) of tropical regions is generally smaller, as is the New Guinea native cat (D. albopunctatus), which occupies a variety of habitats on its native island. The largest species, the spotted-tailed native cat (D. maculatus, also called the tiger cat), has a length of 75 to 130 cm, including its 35- to 55-cm tail. This species occurs in the dense, moist forests of Tasmania and eastern Australia.
