After studying law and serving in World War I, Tucholsky left Germany in 1924 and lived first in Paris and after 1929 in Sweden. He contributed to Rote Signale (1931; “Red Signals”), a collection of communist poetry, and to Schaubühne, later Die Weltbühne, a journal published by the pacifist Carl von Ossietzky.
