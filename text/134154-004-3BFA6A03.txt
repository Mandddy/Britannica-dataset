Giovanni Pontano, Latin Jovianus Pontanus   (born May 7, 1426, Cerreto di Spoleto, near Perugia, Papal States [Italy]â€”died  September 1503, Naples) Italian prose writer, poet, and royal official whose works reflect the diversity of interests and knowledge of the Renaissance. His supple and easy Latin style is considered, with that of Politian, to be the best of Renaissance Italy.
Pontano studied language and literature in Perugia. From 1447 to 1495 he served the Aragonese kings of Naples as adviser, military secretary, and, after 1486, chancellor, an office he handled with great distinction. He was dismissed in 1495 for negotiating peace with the French and, though pardoned, did not return to power.
