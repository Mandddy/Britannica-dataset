Algonquin Provincial Park,  wilderness area, southeastern Ontario, Canada. It lies about 140 miles (225 km) northeast of Toronto and covers an area of 2,955 square miles (7,653 square km). Established in 1893, the park, once a lumbering area, is a hilly wildlife refuge for bears, beaver, deer, moose, and smaller game. It straddles the drainage divide between the Ottawa River and Georgian Bay, and its numerous lakes and streams offer canoeing and fishing for bass, lake trout, pickerel, and muskellunge.
