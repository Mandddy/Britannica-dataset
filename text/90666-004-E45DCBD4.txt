Robert Mitchum, in full Robert Charles Duran Mitchum  (born August 6, 1917, Bridgeport, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 1, 1997, Santa Barbara county, California) American film star whose roles as a cool, cynical loner combined with a notorious personal life and a sardonic, relaxed style to create a durable screen image as a fatalistic tough guy.
Expelled from Haaren High School in New York City’s Hell’s Kitchen, Mitchum took to the road during the early years of the Depression. The experiences of this period of his life served as his “education,” shaping his world-weary view and providing fodder for press interviews for the rest of his life. He eventually landed in Long Beach, California, where his sister Julie had settled, and in 1936 she persuaded him to join her in the local theatre guild. He launched his film career with a bit role in a Hopalong Cassidy western, Hoppy Serves a Writ (1943), which led to other small roles and eventually a contract with RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.
