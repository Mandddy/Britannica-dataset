Kind Hearts and Coronets, British comedy, released in 1949, that came to be recognized as one of the best British films of all time. It was noted for its dark humour and for the performance of Alec Guinness, who played eight characters.
Ruthlessly ambitious aristocrat Louis Mazzini (played by Dennis Price) seeks to avenge his mother, disowned by her family for marrying below her station, by gaining the dukedom of her distant dead relative. In order to do so, he systematically murders each of the individuals standing in his way in the line of successionâ€”excepting those who conveniently die without his help. These relatives, seven men and one woman, are all played by Guinness, and each dies in an unusual, darkly comic way. Mazzini finds his mission compromised, however, when his romantic dalliance with the widow of one of his victims causes his former lover to launch a plot of her own.
