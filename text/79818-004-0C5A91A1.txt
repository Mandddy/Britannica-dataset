Dorothy West,  (born June 2, 1907, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died August 16, 1998, Boston) American writer who explored the aspirations and conflicts of middle-class African Americans in many of her works and was one of the last surviving members of the prominent group of black artists, writers, and musicians who flourished in New York City’s Harlem district during the Harlem Renaissance.
West began writing when she was 7 years old, and when she was 14 her stories began to be published in the Boston Post. In 1926 her short story “The Typewriter” won a prize in a national competition held by Opportunity, a monthly publication of the National Urban League, and shortly thereafter she moved to New York and was taken under the wing of a group of Harlem literary figures. Among her circle—where, as the youngest member, she was known as “the kid”—were Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Wallace Thurman, and Countee Cullen. “The Typewriter” was included in The Best Short Stories of 1926 (1926, edited by Edward O’Brien).
