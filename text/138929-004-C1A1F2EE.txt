Peccary (family Tayassuidae), also called javelin or javelina,  any of the three species of piglike mammal found in the southern deserts of the United States southward through the Amazon basin to Patagonian South America (see Patagonia). Closely resembling the wild pig (see boar), the peccary has dark coarse hair and a large head with a circular snout. The ears are small, as is the tail, which is generally not visible. Its spearlike canine teeth give the peccary its other common names, javelin and javelina. These teeth do not protrude but make notable lumps in the lips.
Peccaries are the New World counterparts of swine (family Suidae) and differ from true pigs in certain skeletal and dental features. They also have a scent gland under the skin that opens on the ridge of the back and gives off a strong musky odour; this gland is the reason for the mistaken belief that peccaries have two navels, one above and one below. Peccaries are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plants, small animals, and carrion. They have a barking alarm call and when disturbed make a rattling sound by chattering their teeth. Although ferocious when harassed, they are sometimes tamed by South American Indians. Peccaries are also hunted for their hides and meat. Litters usually consist of two young, born after a five-month gestation period.
