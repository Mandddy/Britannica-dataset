Palace Museum, also called Imperial Palace Museum, Chinese (Pinyin) Gugong Bowuyuan (“Ancient Palace Museum”),  in Beijing, museum housed in the main buildings of the former Imperial Palaces (see also Forbidden City). It exhibits valuable objects from Chinese history.
The palace consists of many separate halls and courtyards. The outer buildings of the palace became a museum in 1914, although the imperial family continued to live in the private apartments until 1924. In 1925, after the former emperor Puyi of the Qing dynasty was moved out, the Palace Museum was formally established. Many of the halls surrounding the museum are presented as they would have appeared in dynastic times. The main buildings of the museum include the Hall of Supreme Harmony, one of the largest wooden buildings in China. The Hall of Preserving Harmony displays a fine collection of works of art, many from the imperial treasures. Among the more impressive works is a 14-metre- (47-foot-) long Yuan fresco that was taken from the Xinghua Temple. Other areas of the palace contain displays of bronzes, sculptures, pottery and porcelain, jade, and silks. Some of the treasures are exhibited in the northeast corner of the palace, known as the Palace of Peace and Longevity. These include priceless objects of precious metals and jewels and some examples of the 3,000 pieces that formed the imperial tableware.
