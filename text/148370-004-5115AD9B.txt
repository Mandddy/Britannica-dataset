Scottish deerhound, dog breed called the “royal dog of Scotland,” known since the 16th century. It was once the exclusive property of the nobility, who prized it as a hunter of the Scottish stag. Like the greyhound in build but larger and more heavily boned, the Scottish deerhound stands 28 to 32 inches (71 to 81 cm) and weighs 75 to 110 pounds (34 to 50 kg). Its coat is harsh and wiry and ranges from blue-gray to yellow-brown. This dog is a strong, swift, and formidable hunter but a loyal and gentle companion.
