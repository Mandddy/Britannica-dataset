Symon Petlyura, in full Symon Vasylevych Petlyura, Petlyura also spelled Petliura  (born May 10, 1879, Poltava, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died  May 25, 1926, Paris, France) socialist leader of Ukraine’s unsuccessful fight for independence following the Russian revolutions of 1917.
One of the founders of the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party in 1905, Petlyura published two socialist weekly newspapers before the onset of World War I, when he became an officer in the Russian army (1914). After the imperial government of Russia was overthrown by the February Revolution (1917), he joined the Ukrainian Central Rada (“council”), which proclaimed Ukraine to be an autonomous republic (June 1917); and in July he was appointed secretary of military affairs for the newly formed governing council.
