Elizabeth Blackwell,  (born February 3, 1821, Counterslip, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England—died  May 31, 1910, Hastings, Sussex) Anglo-American physician who is considered the first woman doctor of medicine in modern times.
Elizabeth Blackwell was of a large, prosperous, and cultured family and was well educated by private tutors. Financial reverses and the family’s liberal social and religious views prompted them to immigrate to the United States in the summer of 1832. Soon after taking up residence in New York, her father, Samuel Blackwell, became active in abolitionist activities. The Blackwells moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1835 and to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1838. Soon afterward Samuel Blackwell’s death left the family in poverty, and Elizabeth and two sisters opened a private school. Later Elizabeth taught school in Henderson, Kentucky, and in 1845–47 in North and South Carolina.
