Sholem Asch, Sholem also spelled Shalom or Sholom, Yiddish Sholem Ash  (born November 1, 1880, Kutno, Poland, Russian Empire—died July 10, 1957, London, England) Polish-born American novelist and playwright, the most controversial and one of the most widely known writers in modern Yiddish literature.
One of the 10 surviving children of a poor family, Asch was educated at Kutno’s Hebrew school. In 1899 he went to Warsaw, and in 1900 he published his highly praised first story—written, as was a cycle that followed, in Hebrew. On the advice of the Yiddish writer I.L. Peretz, he subsequently decided to write only in Yiddish, and with Dos Shtetl (1905; The Little Town, 1907) he began a career outstanding for both output and impact. His tales, novels, and plays filled 29 volumes in a collected Yiddish edition published in 1929–38. By their vitality and vigorous naturalism, his works attracted sizable reading publics in Europe and the United States and were soon widely translated. Unlike his great Yiddish predecessors, Asch was fortunate in having inspired translators—among them Edwin and Willa Muir and Maurice Samuel—through whom his work could enter the literary mainstream.
