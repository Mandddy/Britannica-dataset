The Mills Brothers, John Charles (b. Oct. 19, 1910, Piqua, Ohio, U.S.—d. Jan. 24, 1936, Bellefontaine, Ohio), Herbert (b. April 2, 1912, Piqua—d. April 12, 1989, Las Vegas, Nev.), Harry (b. Aug. 19, 1913, Piqua—d. June 28, 1982, Los Angeles, Calif.), and Donald (b. April 29, 1915, Piqua—d. Nov. 13, 1999, Los Angeles), American vocal quartet that was among the most unique and influential in the history of both jazz and mainstream popular music.
The Mills Brothers began as a barbershop quartet—which was perhaps only natural, as their father, John H. Mills (1882–1967), owned a barbershop. They gave their first public performances in variety shows on the radio in Cincinnati, Ohio. In about 1930 they moved to New York City, where they became the first African American singers to have their own national radio show. Billed as “Four Boys and a Guitar” and accompanied only by brother John’s guitar, they could sound like a full jazz band, particularly on such numbers as “Tiger Rag,” “St. Louis Blues,” and “Bugle Call Rag.” Each brother specialized in an “instrument”: they imitated two trumpets, a trombone, and a tuba. They were also a hit on records and in live performances, and they appeared in several films, including The Big Broadcast (1932) and Broadway Gondolier (1935).
