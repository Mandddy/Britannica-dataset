Friedrich Ludwig Jahn,  (born Aug. 11, 1778, Lanz, Brandenburg, Prussia—died  Oct. 15, 1852, Freyburg an der Unstrut, Prussian Saxony) the German “father of gymnastics” who founded the turnverein (gymnastics club) movement in Germany. He was a fervent patriot who believed that physical education was the cornerstone of national health and strength and important in strengthening character and national identity.
Jahn studied theology, history, and philology (1796–1802) at the universities of Halle, Frankfurt an der Oder, Göttingen, and Greifswald. He spent the next years tutoring, travelling, and attending classes at Jena and Göttingen. In 1809 he settled in Berlin, where he held several teaching positions at secondary schools. There he began a program of outdoor physical exercise for students. He invented the parallel bars, the rings, the balance beam, the horse, and the horizontal bar, which became standard equipment for gymnastics. He established a strong following among both youths and adults and in 1811 opened his first gymnastics club.
