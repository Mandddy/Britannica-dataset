Oto, also spelled Otoe, also called (since the turn of the 19th century) Otoe Missouria,  North American Indian people of the Chiwere branch of the Siouan linguistic family, which also includes the languages of the closely related Missouri and Iowa tribes.
In their historic past the Oto, together with the Iowa and the Missouri, separated from the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) and moved southwest. In 1673, when met by the Jacques Marquette expedition, they were living some distance up the Des Moines River in present-day Iowa. The Oto merged with the dwindling Missouri group in 1798. By 1804, when they were encountered by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, they were living near the mouth of the Platte River. A series of treaties, in 1830, 1833, 1836, and 1854, ceded all their lands in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska—except for a reservation on Big Blue River in southern Nebraska—to the United States government. In 1882, together with the Missouri, the Oto were removed to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), where they were grouped with the Ponca, Pawnee, and Oakland tribes into one agency. The reservation land was later dispersed by means of the Dawes General Allotment Act (1887), whereby parcels of land were distributed to individuals (and could be bought by non-Indians). A lawsuit settled in 1964 compensated the tribe for the lands thus lost. The headquarters of the Otoe Missouria tribe are in Red Rock, Okla., U.S. In the early 21st century, the tribe operated several casinos and convenience stores in that region.
