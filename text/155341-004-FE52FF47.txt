Père-Lachaise Cemetery, formal name Cimetiere de l’Est (“Cemetery of the East”),  cemetery and park located on the northeast side of Paris, France. Situated on some 110 acres (44.5 hectares), amid more than 5,000 trees, it is both the largest park and the largest cemetery in Paris. Estimates concerning the number of people buried there vary widely, from some 300,000 to about 1,000,000. Père-Lachaise is a major tourist attraction, renowned for its tombs of notable figures, and it is often hailed as the most-visited cemetery in the world. It has always been nondenominational. Among the famous people buried there are Peter Abelard and Héloïse, Molière, Eugène Delacroix, Jacques-Louis David, Georges Bizet, Frédéric Chopin, Honoré de Balzac, Marcel Proust, Georges Seurat, Oscar Wilde, Sarah Bernhardt, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein, Colette, Edith Piaf, Marcel Marceau, Richard Wright, Yves Montand, and Jim Morrison. The remains of Abelard and Héloïse (who died in 1142 and 1164, respectively) are reportedly the oldest identifiable bones in the cemetery.
The cemetery grounds are located on a hillside once known as Champ Evêque, where an affluent merchant lived in the 15th century. Jesuits took possession of his house in the 17th century and converted it into a Jesuit retreat. King Louis XIV’s confessor, Father François de la Chaise d’Aix (commonly called le Père la Chaise), resided there, and the cemetery’s name derives from him. The Jesuits renamed the hill Mont-Louis in honour of the king, who reportedly visited the area during times of unrest, as during the Fronde. The king’s bodyguard also had a residence there, and the area became noted for its lavish parties, attended by those anxious to curry favour with both the king and his confessor. After Père La Chaise died in 1709, the estate was greatly expanded. The Jesuits were evicted from the property in the mid-1760s during the general expulsion of the order from France.
