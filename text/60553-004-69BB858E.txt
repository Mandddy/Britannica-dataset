Calf roping, also called tie-down roping,  rodeo event in which a lasso-wielding cowboy or cowgirl moves from horseback to foot in pursuit of a calf. The contestant chases the calf on horseback, lassoes it, and dismounts to “throw” it down by hand (if the calf is down, the contestant must wait until it has regained its footing before throwing it). The roper then ties any three legs with a 6-foot (1.8-metre) “pigging string” that has been carried in the contestant’s teeth. The roper signals completion by raising both hands. The performance is timed, and the contestant with the fastest time wins. The competitor’s horse is trained to hold the rope taut without dragging the calf.
At the start of the event, the contestant waits in a roping box next to the calf chute, where the roper’s horse is held back by a rope barrier. The roper calls for the calf to be released, and, once it crosses a predetermined line, the rope barrier is in turn released. If the roper breaks the barrier, a penalty of 10 seconds is assessed, and, if the calf does not remain tied for 6 seconds, the competitor is disqualified.
