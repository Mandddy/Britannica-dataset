Shoveler,  any of four species of dabbling ducks in the genus Anas (family Anatidae) with large, long, spoon-shaped bills. The northern shoveler (A. clypeata) nests in North America, Europe, and northern Asia, migrating to South America, North Africa, and southern Asia in winter. The male has a green head, white breast, chestnut belly and sides, and a blue patch on the forewing. It is not highly desired as a game bird, because of the poor flavour of the meat—hence the hunters’ sobriquet “neighbour’s mallard,” i.e., best given away to one less discerning. Shovelers appear somewhat humpbacked in the air, although they are rapid fliers. They inhabit shallow marshes and lagoons, where they use their large bills, lined with comblike teeth (lamellae), to sift small organisms and seeds from the mud. In deeper waters the northern shoveler skims the surface for plankton. Other species are the red shoveler (A. platalea) of South America; the Cape, or Smith’s, shoveler (A. smithii) of South Africa; and the Australasian, or blue-winged, shoveler (A. rhynchotis) of New Zealand and Australia.
