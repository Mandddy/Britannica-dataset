Battle of Bunker Hill, also known as Battle of Breed’s Hill,  (June 17, 1775), first major battle of the American Revolution, fought in Charlestown (now part of Boston) during the Siege of Boston. Although the British eventually won the battle, it was a Pyrrhic victory that lent considerable encouragement to the revolutionary cause. The Bunker Hill Monument, a 221-foot (67-metre) granite obelisk, marks the site on Breed’s Hill where most of the fighting took place.
Within two months after the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775), more than 15,000 troops from Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island had assembled in the vicinity of Boston to confront the British army of 5,000 or more stationed there. General Artemas Ward, commander in chief of the Massachusetts troops, served as the senior New England officer. There were two obvious points from which Boston was vulnerable to artillery fire: Dorchester Heights, and two high hills, Bunker’s and Breed’s, in Charlestown, about a quarter of a mile across the Charles River from the north shore of Boston. By the middle of June, hearing that British general Thomas Gage was about to occupy Dorchester Heights, the colonists decided to fortify the hills. By the time they were discovered, Colonel William Prescott and his men had completed a redoubt atop Breed’s Hill (which was an indefensible decision in the eyes of many historians, since Breed’s Hill was lower and less impregnable than Bunker Hill). Despite a cannonade from British men-of-war in the harbour and from a battery across the river in north Boston, the colonists continued to strengthen their position.
