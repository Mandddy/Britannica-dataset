Advent, (
        Latin adventus, "coming"
            ) in the Christian church calendar, the period of preparation for the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ at Christmas and also of preparation for the Second Coming of Christ. It begins on the Sunday nearest to November 30 (St. Andrew’s Day) and is the beginning of the new church year. The date when the season was first observed is uncertain. Bishop Perpetuus of Tours (461–490) established a fast before Christmas that began on November 11 (St. Martin’s Day), and the Council of Tours (567) mentioned an Advent season. Its liturgical meaning referred to the dual “coming” of Jesus—his incarnation in Bethlehem and his second coming as judge at the end of time. Together with Lent it was observed as a penitential season, though not with the same rigour as Lent. Consequently, Advent developed increasingly into the joyful anticipation of Jesus’ birth.
In many countries it is marked by a variety of popular observances, such as the lighting of Advent candles, one on each of the four Sundays before Christmas.
