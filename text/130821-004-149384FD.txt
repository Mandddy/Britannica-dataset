Juan Carlos Onetti,  (born July 1, 1909, Montevideo, Uru.—died May 30, 1994, Madrid, Spain) Uruguayan novelist and short-story writer whose existential works chronicle the decay of modern urban life. The protagonists of his novels lead unhappy, isolated lives in an absurd and sordid world from which they can escape only through memories, fantasies, or death.
Onetti studied at the university in Buenos Aires and held various jobs before he started writing. His first published work, the novella El pozo (1939; The Pit), treats the aimless life of a man lost within a city where he is unable to communicate with others. The book’s complex fusion of reality with fantasy and inner experience makes it one of the first distinctively modern Spanish American novels. In the novel Tierra de nadie (1942; No Man’s Land) Onetti again presents a nihilistic view of city life devoid of any spiritual meaning.
