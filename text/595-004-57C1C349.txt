Floor exercise, gymnastics event in which movements are performed on the floor in an area 12 metres (40 feet) square. This area is covered by some type of cloth or mat, usually with some cushioning. No other apparatus is used. Menâ€™s routines are 50 to 70 seconds in duration. The type of exercise required is a series of movements combining elements of flexibility, strength, jumps, holding of poses, and balance, as well as other maneuvers. The whole routine must be performed with rhythm and harmony, and the gymnast must move in different directions, using a major portion of the allotted area.
The exercise usually starts and finishes with a series of tumbling movements, such as a handspring or a cartwheel with a half-turn (roundoff), continuing with handsprings and somersaults (in the air), either backward or forward. Between start and finish, balances are held on one leg, handstands are achieved by placing the hands on the floor and kicking to a standing position, and movements resembling ballet, tumbling movements, and jumps are interposed.
