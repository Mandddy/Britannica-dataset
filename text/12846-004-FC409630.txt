Clearwing moth (family Sesiidae), also called Wasp Moth,  any of approximately 1,000 species of moths (order Lepidoptera) that are long-legged with a slender, dark body with bright red or yellow markings. The wings frequently lack scales and are transparent. Unlike those of other moths, the front and back wings are hooked together by a series of curved spines (similar to the wasps they mimic). Many of the species resemble wasps, which is a form of protective mimicry.
Larvae are pale, wormlike borers, often injurious to cultivated plants. They bore in roots and stems for about one year and usually pupate in their burrows.
