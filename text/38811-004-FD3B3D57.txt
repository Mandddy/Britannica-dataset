Edmund Wilson, byname Bunny  (born May 8, 1895, Red Bank, New Jersey, U.S.—died June 12, 1972, Talcottville, New York) American critic and essayist recognized as one of the leading literary journalists of his time.
Educated at Princeton, Wilson moved from newspaper reporting in New York to become managing editor of Vanity Fair (1920–21), associate editor of The New Republic (1926–31), and principal book reviewer for The New Yorker (1944–48). Wilson’s first critical work, Axel’s Castle (1931), was an important international survey of the Symbolist tradition, in which he both criticized and praised the aestheticism of such writers as William Butler Yeats, Paul Valéry, T.S. Eliot, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein. During this period, Wilson was married for a time to writer Mary McCarthy. His next major book, To the Finland Station (1940), was a historical study of the thinkers who laid the groundwork for socialism and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Much of these two books originally appeared in the pages of The New Republic. Until late in 1940 he was a contributor to that periodical, and much of his work for it was collected in Travels in Two Democracies (1936), dialogues, essays, and a short story about the Soviet Union and the United States; The Triple Thinkers (1938), which dealt with writers involved in multiple meanings; The Wound and the Bow (1941), about art and neurosis; and The Boys in the Back Room (1941), a discussion of such new American novelists as John Steinbeck and James M. Cain. In addition to reviewing books for The New Yorker in the 1940s, Wilson also contributed major articles to the magazine until the year of his death, including serialization of Upstate: Records and Recollections of Northern New York (1972), a collection from his journals.
