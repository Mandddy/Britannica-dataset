Sir Charles Tilston Bright,  (born June 8, 1832, Wanstead, Essex, Eng.â€”died  May 3, 1888, Abbey Wood, near London) British engineer who superintended the laying of the first Atlantic telegraph cable.
In 1852 he became an engineer for the Magnetic Telegraph Company, for which he laid thousands of miles of underground telegraph lines in England as well as the first undersea cable (1853) from Portpatrick, Scot., to Donaghadee, Ire. In 1856, Bright, with Cyrus Field and J.W. Brett, formed the Atlantic Telegraph Company, whose purpose was to lay the first Atlantic cable between Ireland and Newfoundland. Bright was made engineer in chief. After two failures, Bright landed the Irish end of the line at Valentia, County Kerry, in August 1858. A few days later he was knighted in Dublin. Although the cable broke down in October, its success had proved the practicability of the scheme. He was consulting engineer for the second and third Atlantic cables of 1865 and 1866. Subsequently, he supervised the laying of submarine cables in several other regions.
