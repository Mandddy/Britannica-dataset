J.-B. Say, in full Jean-Baptiste Say  (born January 5, 1767, Lyon, France—died November 15, 1832, Paris) French economist, best known for his law of markets, which postulates that supply creates its own demand.
After completing his education, Say worked briefly for an insurance company and then as a journalist. In 1794 he became an editor of a new magazine dedicated to the ideas of the French Revolution; he later became editor in chief of the magazine. He was appointed to the Tribunate under the consulate in 1799 but was later dismissed by Napoleon. In 1807 he started a cotton-spinning mill, which he sold in 1813. Next he held a chair in industrial economy at the Conservatory of Arts and Crafts from 1817 to 1830, and he was a professor of political economy at the Collège de France from 1830 until his death. His major publication was Traité d’économie politique (1803; A Treatise on Political Economy).
