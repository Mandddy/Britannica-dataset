Brine shrimp,  (genus Artemia), any of several small crustaceans of the order Anostraca (class Branchiopoda) inhabiting brine pools and other highly saline inland waters throughout the world. Artemia salina, the species that occurs in vast numbers in Great Salt Lake, Utah, is of commercial importance. Young brine shrimp hatched there from dried eggs are used widely as food for fish and other small animals in aquariums. Measuring up to 15 mm (0.6 inch) in length, the body of the brine shrimp has a discrete head with a nauplius (larval) eye and stalked compound eyes, a thorax bearing a series of leaflike limbs, and a slender abdomen without appendages. Brine shrimp normally swim in an upside down position by rhythmically beating their legs. They feed primarily on green algae, which they filter from the water with their legs.
