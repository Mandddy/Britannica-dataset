B.B. King, byname of Riley B. King   (born September 16, 1925, near Itta Bena, Mississippi, U.S.—died May 14, 2015, Las Vegas, Nevada) American guitarist and singer who was a principal figure in the development of blues and from whose style leading popular musicians drew inspiration.
King was reared in the Mississippi delta, and gospel music in church was the earliest influence on his singing. To his own impassioned vocal calls, King played lyrical single-string guitar responses with a distinctive vibrato; his guitar style was influenced by T-Bone Walker, by delta blues players (including his cousin Bukka White), and by such jazz guitarists as Django Reinhardt and Charlie Christian. He worked for a time as a disc jockey in Memphis, Tennessee (notably at station WDIA), where he acquired the name “B.B.” (for “Blues Boy”) King.
