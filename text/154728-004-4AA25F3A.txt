Lanford Wilson, in full Lanford Eugene Wilson  (born April 13, 1937, Lebanon, Missouri, U.S.—died March 24, 2011, Wayne, New Jersey) American playwright, a pioneer of the Off-Off-Broadway and regional theatre movements. His plays are known for experimental staging, simultaneous dialogue, and deferred character exposition. He won a 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Talley’s Folly (1979).
Wilson attended schools in Missouri, San Diego, and Chicago before moving to New York City in 1962. From 1963 his plays were produced regularly at Off-Off-Broadway theatres such as Caffe Cino and La Mama Experimental Theatre Club. Home Free! and The Madness of Lady Bright (published together in 1968) are two one-act plays first performed in 1964; the former involves a pair of incestuous siblings, and the latter features an aging transvestite. Balm in Gilead (1965), Wilson’s first full-length play, is set in a crowded world of hustlers and junkies. The Rimers of Eldritch (1967) examines life in a small town.
