Borzoi, breed of hound dog developed in Russia to pursue wolves. It is descended from the Arabian greyhound and a collielike Russian sheepdog. The borzoi—formerly known as the Russian wolfhound—is a graceful, strong, and swift dog. Males stand at least 28 inches (71 cm) and females 26 inches (66 cm); weights range from 60 to 105 pounds (27 to 48 kg). It has a long, narrow head, small ears, a deep but narrow chest, long, muscular hindquarters, and a long, curved tail. The silky coat is flat or slightly curled and usually white with darker markings. The dog is noted for its elegant appearance.
