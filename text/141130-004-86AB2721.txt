Guadiana River, Arabic Wādī Ana, Portuguese Rio Guadiana, Spanish Río Guadiana,   one of the longest streams of the Iberian Peninsula, flowing generally westward through south-central Spain and southeastern Portugal to the Gulf of Cádiz in the Atlantic Ocean. The river has a drainage area of 23,455 square miles (60,748 square km), a length of 483 miles (778 km), and about 30 major tributaries. Its flow is relatively meagre—only about half that of the Tagus or the Douro—because its basin drains the low-rainfall areas of the Toledo Mountains, the Sierra Morena, and the plains of La Mancha.
The Záncara (the true source of the upper Guadiana) and Gigüela rivers rise in the wetter mountains of Cuenca province of Spain. To the west of Daimiel these rivers form marshy lakes, known as Ojos del Guadiana (“Eyes of the Guadiana”), a noted wildfowl sanctuary. By contrast, the porous limestones found in other parts of the river’s basin form a shallow water table, producing intermittent streams such as the Guadiana Alto, Azuer, and Cárcoles that disappear underground, though eventually feeding the Guadiana.
