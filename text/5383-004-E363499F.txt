Tropical and subtropical desert climate, major climate type of the Köppen classification dominated in all months by the subtropical anticyclone (or subtropical high), with its descending air, elevated inversions, and clear skies. Such an atmospheric environment inhibits precipitation. Most of Earth’s tropical, true desert (BW) climates occur between 15° and 30° latitude, at the poleward end of the Hadley cell circulation (see atmosphere). In the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system, this climate is divided between the tropical desert (BWh) and subtropical desert (part of BWk) subtypes.
The most extreme arid areas also are far removed from sources of moisture-bearing winds in the interiors of continents and are best developed on the western sides of continents, where the subtropical anticyclone shows its most intense development. An exception to the general tendency for aridity to be associated with subsidence is in the so-called Horn of Africa region, where the dryness of Somalia is caused more by the orientation of the landmass in relation to the atmospheric circulation. Both the high- and low-sun monsoonal winds blow parallel to the coast, so that moisture-laden maritime air can penetrate over land only infrequently.
