Jean Dorat,  Dorat also spelled Daurat, Latin Auratus  (born 1508, Le Dorat, near Limoges, Fr.—died  Nov. 1, 1588, Paris) French humanist, a brilliant Hellenist, one of the poets of the Pléiade, and their mentor for many years.
Dorat belonged to a noble family; after studying at the Collège de Limoges, he became tutor to the pages of Francis I. He tutored Jean-Antoine de Baïf, whose father he succeeded as director of the Collège de Coqueret. There, besides Baïf, his pupils included Pierre de Ronsard, Rémy Belleau, and Pontus de Tyard. Joachim du Bellay was added to this group by Ronsard, and these five young poets, along with and under the direction of Dorat, formed a society for the reform of French language and literature. They increased their number to seven with the dramatist Étienne Jodelle and named themselves La Pléiade, in emulation of the seven Greek poets of Alexandria. The election of Dorat as their president proved his personal influence, but as a writer of French verse he is the least important of the seven.
