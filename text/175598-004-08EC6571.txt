Great Expectations, British dramatic film, released in 1946, that was based on the Charles Dickens novel of the same name.
The film follows Pip (played by Anthony Wager), an impoverished orphan in rural England. Pip occasionally spends time at the house of the spinster Miss Havisham (Martita Hunt), where he falls in love with her ward, Estella (Jean Simmons). Later, as a young man, Pip (now played by John Mills) discovers that an anonymous benefactor has financed a gentleman’s lifestyle for him in London. There he becomes friends with the raffish Herbert Pocket (Alec Guinness) and doggedly pursues Estella (now played by Valerie Hobson), despite her claims that she is not interested in him. Eventually, Pip encounters Abel Magwitch (Finlay Currie), an escaped convict to whom Pip as a child had once provided comfort. After Magwitch, who has become wealthy overseas, confesses that he is Pip’s benefactor, Pip arranges to escort him away from England, where he is still wanted. The plan is thwarted, however, when Magwitch is fatally wounded in an altercation with an old enemy. Soon thereafter, Pip learns that Magwitch is Estella’s father. In the end, Pip persuades Estella to leave Havisham’s house, where she has been living in solitude since her guardian’s death, after declaring his enduring love for her.
