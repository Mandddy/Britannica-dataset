Burseraceae,  family of flowering plants in the order Sapindales, composed of about 16 genera of resinous trees and shrubs. They are native primarily to tropical America, but a few species occur in Africa and Asia. Members of the family have leaves that alternate along the stem and are composed of many leaflets, solitary or clustered flowers, and fleshy fruits. The gumbo-limbo, or incense tree (Bursera simaruba), has light, reddish brown wood that is used for fishing floats; its fragrant resin is used in incense. The oleo-gum resin from several species of the genus Boswellia, called frankincense, was used in biblical times in incense, in medicine, and for embalming. Myrrh is the resin from plants of the genus Commiphora. Elemi resins are obtained from other genera of the family, and species such as Aucoumea klaineana produce useful timber.
