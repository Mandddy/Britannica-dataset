St. Andrews, city, royal burgh (1160), university town, golfing mecca, and former fishing port in Fife council area and historic county, Scotland. Located on St. Andrews Bay of the North Sea 13 miles (20 km) southeast of Dundee, it occupies a plateau of sandstone rock about 50 feet (15 metres) in elevation, which breaks off to the north in precipitous cliffs. The Eden River enters St. Andrews Bay northwest of the golf links, which rank among the finest in the world.
St. Andrews was once the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland. Its religious traditions began in the 6th century, when St. Kenneth is believed to have formed a Celtic ecclesiastical community. In the 8th century the king of the Picts established a new church dedicated to St. Andrew, who was adopted as the patron saint of the Picts and thereafter of Scotland. Relics of the saint were brought there and acquired such celebrity that the place, first called Mucross (“Headland of the Wild Boar”) and then Kilrymont (“Cell of the King’s Mount”), came to be known as St. Andrews. About 908 the bishop of the Scots transferred his seat there from Dunkeld. In the early 12th century the bishopric of St. Andrews was regarded as the most important in the kingdom; it was raised to the dignity of an archbishopric in 1472, when its holder was recognized as primate of Scotland.
