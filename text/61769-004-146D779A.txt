Vittorio De Sica,  (born July 7, 1902, Sora, Italy—died November 13, 1974, Paris, France) film director and actor who was a major figure in the Italian Neorealist movement.
During a prolific career that spanned 55 years, De Sica directed 35 films and acted in more than 150. His career as an actor began in 1918 with a small part in a silent film. Throughout the 1920s he performed in films and musical theatre and with touring theatre companies before attaining stardom in Italy with his role in Mario Camerini’s Gli uomini, che mascalzoni! (1932; “What Rascals Men Are!”). De Sica’s subsequent roles throughout the 1930s established him as a romantic leading man who was especially deft at light comedy; many critics have compared his screen persona to that of Cary Grant.
