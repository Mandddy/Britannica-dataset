William H. Crawford,  (born Feb. 24, 1772, Amherst County [now Nelson County], Virginia—died  Sept. 15, 1834, Elberton, Ga., U.S.) American political leader of the early U.S. republic; he finished third in electoral votes in the four-candidate race for president in 1824.
After living in Virginia and South Carolina, the Crawford family moved to Georgia, where William attended Moses Waddel’s Carmel Academy. He then taught school in Augusta, studied law, and in 1799 opened a law practice in Lexington, Ga. A Jeffersonian Republican, he entered elective politics in 1803, winning a seat in the Georgia legislature. In 1807 he went to Washington to fill the unexpired term of Georgia’s deceased U.S. senator Abraham Baldwin. In the Senate, Crawford quickly earned a reputation for wisdom and sound judgment, and the Georgia legislature elected him to a full term as senator in 1811. Crawford backed U.S. preparations for and the declaration of war against Britain in 1812 and—unlike most Democratic Republicans—favoured a tariff and extension of the charter of the Bank of the United States. When Vice President George Clinton died in 1812, Crawford was elected president pro tempore of the Senate (which his predecessor, Baldwin, had been) but left the position the following year to become minister to France.
