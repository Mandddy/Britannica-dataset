East Riding of Yorkshire, also called North Humberside and East Yorkshire,  unitary authority and geographic county, historic county of Yorkshire, northeastern England. It extends from the Yorkshire Wolds in the north to the River Humber in the south and from the North Sea in the east to the River Derwent in the west. The unitary authority is the largest in area in England. Beverley, in the south-central part of the unitary authority, is the administrative centre.
The geographic county of East Riding of Yorkshire covers not only the entire unitary authority of the same name but also the neighbouring city and unitary authority of Kingston upon Hull (Hull). The unitary authority of East Riding of Yorkshire comprises the entire geographic county except for Hull. The geographic county and unitary authority take their name from the East Riding, a division of the historic county of Yorkshire, but they do not cover the same area as this historic division, which, like the geographic county, includes Hull. However, the historic East Riding also includes two areas outside the geographic county. One is the area south of the Rivers Derwent and Hertford that lies in the district of Ryedale and the borough of Scarborough in the present administrative county of North Yorkshire. The other is the area between the Rivers Ouse and Derwent south of the historic York city limits that lies in the present unitary authority of York and in the Selby district of the administrative county of North Yorkshire. Finally, the geographic county and unitary authority encompass an area south of the Ouse, including the town of Goole, that lies in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire.
