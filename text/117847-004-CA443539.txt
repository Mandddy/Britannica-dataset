Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, née Taaffe  (born April 30, 1939, Miami, Fla., U.S.) American composer, the first woman to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize in composition.
She began composing as a child, and, by the time she finished high school, she had studied piano, violin, and trumpet. After receiving both a bachelor’s (1960) and a master’s (1962) degree in music from Florida State University, she taught in a small South Carolina town for a year. In 1964 she moved to New York, where she studied violin with the revered teacher Ivan Galamian. She played with the American Symphony Orchestra (1965–72) under conductor Leopold Stokowski at a time when there were few women musicians in the major orchestras. Also in New York she married Joseph Zwilich, a violinist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra; he died in 1979. In 1975 she became the first woman to receive a doctorate in composition from the Juilliard School, having studied there with the preeminent American composers Elliott Carter and Roger Sessions. As the first person to hold the composer’s chair at Carnegie Hall (1995–99), she organized the “Making Music” concert series, focusing on new music by living composers in an informal setting. She worked solely as a composer until 2000, when she joined the faculty of Florida State University.
