Ediacara fauna, unique assemblage of soft-bodied organisms preserved worldwide as fossil impressions in sandstone from the Proterozoic Eon at the close of Precambrian time. These fauna represent an important landmark in the evolution of life on Earth: they immediately predate the explosion of life-forms at the beginning of the Cambrian Period 541 million years ago. The Ediacara fauna, named for the Ediacara Hills of South Australia in which they were discovered in 1946, were the first metazoans (animals made up of more than one type of cell) that required atmospheric oxygen for their growth. These animals were the precursors of organisms with skeletons, the appearance of which marked the end of Precambrian time and the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon (541 million years ago to the present). The discovery of the Ediacara fauna demonstrated that a far more complex level of evolution had been achieved during Precambrian time than had been previously thought.
The fossil impressions of the Ediacara fauna have a wide variety of shapes, ranging from circular discs (made up of internal radial arrangements, concentric ribbed structures, or combinations) and amorphous masses to plantlike fronds. The disc-shaped impressions are commonly a few centimetres across, though rare specimens reach 20 cm (almost 8 inches) in diameter. The frond-shaped impressions can be as long as about 1 metre (3 feet). Accompanying all types of impressions are “trace fossils”—irregularly shaped, winding burrows on and beneath the surface of the sandstone beds.
