Gottfried Feder,  (born Jan. 27, 1883, Würzburg, Ger.—died  Sept. 24, 1941, Murnau) German political activist who was the principal economic theoretician of the initial phase of German Nazism.
Feder, a civil engineer, gained notoriety in 1919 for his vaguely socialistic “Manifest zur Brechung der Zinsknechtschaft” (“Manifesto on Breaking the Shackles of Interest”), and his speech before a German Workers’ Party meeting at Munich in September of that year provided the immediate inspiration for Adolf Hitler’s entry into politics. Feder’s socialist and anticapitalist ideas subsequently found expression in Hitler’s 25-point program for the National Socialist German Workers’ (Nazi) Party in March 1920, as well as in Feder’s own book, Der deutsche Staat auf nationaler und sozialer Grundlage (1923; “National and Social Bases of the German State”), considered by Hitler to be “the catechism of the [Nazi] movement.” Between 1924 and 1936 Feder sat in the German Reichstag and served as chairman of the Nazi Party’s economic council (1931), state secretary of the German Ministry of Economics (1933), and state housing commissioner (1934). With the general accommodation of Nazi policy to the existing economic system, however, Feder’s role in party affairs drastically diminished, and by 1936 he had been relegated to virtual obscurity.
