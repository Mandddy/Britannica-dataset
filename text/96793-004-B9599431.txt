Eurovision Song Contest, also called Le Grand-Prix Eurovision de la Chanson Européenne,  annual singing contest organized by the European Broadcasting Union. The competition, begun in 1956, gathers performers—selected at the national level by each participating country’s public broadcasting service—from across Europe and representing virtually every genre of popular music.
First held on May 24, 1956, in Lugano, Switzerland, the contest was one of the earliest attempts to broadcast a live televised event to a large international market. The inaugural proceedings featured solo artists (duos were admitted in 1957, but groups would not be allowed to compete until 1971) from just seven countries. That number would more than double by the time the 1961 contest was held in Cannes, France.
