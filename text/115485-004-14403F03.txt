Little Missouri River, river, northwestern United States. It rises along the western slopes of the Missouri Buttes formation (just west of Devils Tower National Monument) in northeastern Wyoming. The river then flows northeast across the southeastern corner of Montana and, after entering the northwestern corner of South Dakota, turns northward. It continues north into southwestern and western North Dakota, turning east to empty into the Missouri River after a course of 560 miles (900 km). The river traverses both the North and South units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota, where it forms scenic badlands.
