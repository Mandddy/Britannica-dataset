Brooks &amp; Dunn, popular American country music duo that became a fixture in the genre in the early 1990s. The band comprised Leon Eric (“Kix”) Brooks (b. May 12, 1955, Shreveport, Louisiana, U.S.) and Ronnie Gene Dunn (b. June 1, 1953, Coleman, Texas, U.S.).
By age six Brooks was playing the ukulele; by the time he was a student at Louisiana State University, he was performing regularly in nightclubs. He moved around the United States, working on the Alaska oil pipeline and at an advertising job in Maine. Finally he went to Nashville, where he took a position on the staff of Tree Publishing, writing hit songs for acts such as Sawyer Brown and the Oak Ridge Boys. He also recorded a self-titled solo album before teaming with Dunn in 1990.
