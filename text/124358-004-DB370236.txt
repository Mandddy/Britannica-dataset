Riot, in criminal law, a violent offense against public order involving three or more people. Like an unlawful assembly, a riot involves a gathering of persons for an illegal purpose. In contrast to an unlawful assembly, however, a riot involves violence. The concept is obviously broad and embraces a wide range of group conduct, from a bloody clash between picketers and strikebreakers to the behaviour of a street-corner gang.
In Anglo-American legal systems, the offense of riot lies mainly in a breach of the peace. Under continental European codes, the offense requires interference with or resistance to public authority. In the United States, the United Kingdom, and India, riot is usually a misdemeanour punishable by light sentences. However, laws in the United Kingdom provide for harsher penalties when rioters refuse to disperse after they have been ordered to do so by a magistrate. In the United States, Canada, and India, the penalty is increased for a riot against public authority, though it is not as harsh as that of the United Kingdom, and the violation of public authority through riot does not require the formal presence of a magistrate.
