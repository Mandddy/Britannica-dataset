Rihanna, byname of Robyn Rihanna Fenty  (born February 20, 1988, St. Michael parish, Barbados) Barbadian pop and rhythm-and-blues (R&amp;B) singer who became a worldwide star in the early 21st century, known for her distinctive and versatile voice and for her fashionable appearance.
Fenty grew up in Barbados with a Barbadian father and a Guyanese mother. As a child, she listened to Caribbean music, such as reggae, as well as American hip-hop and R&amp;B. She especially enjoyed singing and won a high-school talent show with a rendition of a Mariah Carey song. About the same time, she started a girl group with two friends, and in 2004 she attracted the attention of Evan Rogers, an American record producer. He helped Fenty record a demo that led to an audition with the rapper Jay-Z, who at the time headed the Def Jam record label, and he soon signed the budding vocalist. For her professional career, she adopted her middle name, Rihanna.
