Bai Juyi, also spelled Bo Juyi, Wade-Giles romanization Pai Chü-i or Po Chü-i, courtesy name (zi) Letian, literary name (hao) Xiangshan Jushi  (born 772, Xinzheng, Henan province, China—died 846, Luoyang, Henan province) Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty (618–907) who used his elegantly simple verse to protest the social evils of his day, including corruption and militarism.
Bai Juyi began composing poetry at age five. Because of his father’s death in 794 and straitened family circumstances, Bai did not take the official examinations for the bureaucracy until the late age of 28. He passed them and also did extremely well at another examination he took two years later. As a result, he was given a minor post at the palace library, as was another successful examination candidate and poet, Yuan Zhen. They shared views on the need for both literary and political reform, and their lifelong friendship became perhaps the most famous in Chinese history. In 807 Bai became a member of the prestigious Hanlin Academy in Chang’an, the capital, and he rose steadily in official life, except for his banishment in 814 to a minor post at Jiujiang, which arose from the slander of rival courtiers. He assumed the important posts of governor of Zhongzhou (818), Hangzhou (822), and, later, Suzhou. In 829 he became mayor of Luoyang, the eastern capital, but he retired from that post in 842 because of illness.
