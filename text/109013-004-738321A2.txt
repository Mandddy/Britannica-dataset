Miliband was the son of a Belgian father and a Polish mother, Jewish (and Marxist) refugees who had fled Nazi Germany. He grew up in a home devoted to fierce political debate. Like his younger brother, Ed (who also became a member of Brown’s cabinet in 2007), Miliband attended a local comprehensive school in North London.
