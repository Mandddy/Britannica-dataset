Microburst, pattern of intense winds that descends from rain clouds, hits the ground, and fans out horizontally. Microbursts are short-lived, usually lasting from about 5 to 15 minutes, and they are relatively compact, usually affecting an area of 1 to 3 km (about 0.5 to 2 miles) in diameter. They are often but not always associated with thunderstorms or strong rains. By causing a sudden change in wind direction or speed—a condition known as wind shear—microbursts create a particular hazard for airplanes at takeoff and landing because the pilot is confronted with a rapid and unexpected shift from headwind to tailwind.
In arid regions, the rain commonly associated with microbursts often evaporates before the downdraft reaches the ground; the resulting dry microbursts produce no visible clue to their presence. Wet microbursts, typical of more humid areas, are generally accompanied by a visible rain shaft. Bursts can be detected by modern weather radar and by wind sensors on the ground. The mechanics of microburst phenomena are not yet completely understood. Their existence was first observed in 1974 by meteorologist T. Theodore Fujita, and since then they have been identified as the cause of several airline crashes.
