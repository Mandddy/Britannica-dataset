Antoinette Brown Blackwell, née Antoinette Louisa Brown   (born May 20, 1825, Henrietta, N.Y., U.S.—died  Nov. 5, 1921, Elizabeth, N.J.) first woman to be ordained a minister of a recognized denomination in the United States.
Antoinette Brown was a precocious child and at an early age began to speak at meetings of the Congregational church to which she belonged. She attended Oberlin College, completing the literary (nondegree) course in 1847 and, after overcoming objections by family, faculty, and friends (even reformer Lucy Stone was taken aback by the idea), completed the theological course in 1850. Although her professors had allowed her to preach, they refused to license her or allow her to graduate. She was an itinerant preacher and lecturer until September 1853, when she was ordained minister of the Congregational church in South Butler, New York; she became thereby the first ordained woman minister in the country.
