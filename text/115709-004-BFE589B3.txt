Thelon River, stream in eastern Fort Smith region, Northwest Territories, and central Keewatin region, Nunavut territory, Canada. It drains a major portion of the Barren Grounds (a sub-Arctic prairie region). Arising from several lakes, including Whitefish and Lynx, east of Great Slave Lake, the river flows through Thelon Wildlife Sanctuary (where there are musk-oxen) in an easterly direction for 562 miles (904 km), draining Beverly, Aberdeen, Schultz, and Baker lakes before emptying into the west end of the 140-mile- (225-kilometre-) long Chesterfield Inlet, an arm of Hudson Bay. The Canadian geologist Joseph B. Tyrrell and his brother James explored the river and its main tributaries, the Dubawnt and Kazan rivers, in 1893â€“98. The vast tundra region, inhabited by a dispersed Inuit population and drained by the Thelon, is served by the trading posts of Baker Lake (Qamanittuaq; known for its Inuit tapestry) and Chesterfield Inlet (Igluligaarjuk).
