Dan Flavin,  (born April 1, 1933, Jamaica, Queens, New York, U.S.—died November 29, 1996, Riverhead, New York) American artist whose installations featuring fluorescent lighting tubes in geometric arrays emit a rich ambient monochrome or multicoloured light that subtly reshapes the interior spaces in which they are displayed, creating intense visual sensations for the viewer. He was one of the leading exponents of Minimalist art and importantly influenced the direction of international contemporary art.
From an early age Flavin was interested in art, particularly drawing. But, following his father’s wishes, he attended a seminary in Brooklyn from 1947 to 1952. He was never ordained, but he clearly maintained some interest in the spiritual, as his signature explorations of light (a phenomenon in art historically associated with the divine or the numinous) reveal. In 1952 he graduated from Cathedral College of the Immaculate Conception in Douglaston, New York, and he then served in the military in Korea for a year. When he returned to New York City, he studied art history at the New School and at Columbia University. As a studio artist, Flavin was generally self-taught.
