Giovanni Pascoli,  (born December 31, 1855, San Mauro di Romagna, Kingdom of Sardinia [now San Mauro Pascoli, Italy]—died April 6, 1912, Bologna, Italy) Italian classical scholar and poet whose graceful and melancholy Italian lyric poems, perfect in form, rhythmic in style, and innovative in wording, were an important influence on the crepuscolari (“twilight poets”; see crepuscolarismo).
Pascoli had an extremely painful childhood: his father was mysteriously assassinated when he was 12, his mother died when he was 13, and five other children in the family died by the time he reached adulthood. He also experienced a long period of psychological duress while studying on a scholarship at the University of Bologna under the great poet Giosuè Carducci. Pascoli was arrested and imprisoned for a few months in 1879 for preaching political anarchy. Following his imprisonment, he took his younger siblings to live with him, and from 1882 began a career of teaching, first in secondary schools and then in various Italian universities, as professor of Greek, Latin, and Italian literature. In 1905 he was appointed to the chair of Italian literature at the University of Bologna.
