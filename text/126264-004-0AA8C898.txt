Razor, keen-edged cutting implement for shaving or cutting hair. Prehistoric cave drawings show that clam shells, sharkâ€™s teeth, and sharpened flints were used as shaving implements. Solid gold and copper razors have been found in Egyptian tombs of the 4th millennium bce. According to the Roman historian Livy, the razor was introduced in Rome in the 6th century bce by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, legendary king of Rome; but shaving did not become customary until the 5th century bce.
Steel razors with ornamented handles and individually hollow-ground blades were crafted in Sheffield, England, the centre of the cutlery industry, in the 18th and 19th centuries. The hard crucible steel produced there by Benjamin Huntsman in 1740 was first rejected and then, later, after its adoption in France, deemed superior by the local manufacturers.
