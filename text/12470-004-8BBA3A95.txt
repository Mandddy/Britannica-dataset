Daikoku,  in Japanese mythology, one of the Shichi-fuku-jin (Seven Gods of Luck); the god of wealth and guardian of farmers. He is depicted in legend and art as dark-skinned, stout, carrying a wish-granting mallet in his right hand, a bag of precious things slung over his back, and sitting on two rice bags. Rats are sometimes shown nibbling at the rice, further emphasizing the theme of prosperity.
Daikoku is generally associated with the Indian deity Mahākāla (the Hindu god Śiva in his aspect as time, the great destroyer), who travelled to Japan along with Buddhism. In Shintō worship, he is often identified with the deity and mythological hero Ōkuni-nushi, whose name written in Chinese ideograms is pronounced Daikoku. See also Shichi-fuku-jin.
