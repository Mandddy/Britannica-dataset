Bud Selig, byname of Allan H. Selig  (born July 30, 1934, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.) American businessman who served as the de facto (1992–98) and official (1998–2015) commissioner of Major League Baseball (MLB).
After earning a bachelor’s degree in history and political science from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1956, Selig served two years in the military before returning to Milwaukee to work as a car dealer. An avid baseball fan, he eventually became the largest public stockholder in the Milwaukee Braves franchise, and, when the team moved to Atlanta in 1965, he organized a group of investors to bring a major league baseball team back to Milwaukee. His group failed in an attempt to buy the Chicago White Sox in 1969, but the following year they succeeded in acquiring—for $10.8 million—the bankrupt Seattle Pilots, which the group renamed the Milwaukee Brewers. With Selig as club president, the Brewers grew into a successful franchise, making it to the World Series in 1982.
