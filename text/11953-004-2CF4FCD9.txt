Fantail, also called fan-tailed flycatcher ,  any of numerous birds of the family Rhipiduridae. The fantails constitute the genus Rhipidura. Fantails are native to forest clearings, riverbanks, and beaches from southern Asia to New Zealand; some have become tame garden birds. Most of the two dozen species are coloured in shades of gray, black, brown, or rufous, often accented with areas of white, especially on the belly, eyebrows, and tail. They are named from their habit of constantly wagging and spreading their long, rounded tails. They build small cup nests, which are so finely bound in cobweb that they seem shellacked.
Examples are the white-browed fantail (R. aureola), a brownish resident of Bangladesh and India, 18 cm (7 inches) long; and the gray fantail, or cranky fan (R. fuliginosa), 16 cm (6.25 inches) long, a common species in Australia, New Zealand, and nearby islands. The best known Australian fantail is the willy-wagtail (R. leucophrys), found northward to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. One of the larger fantails (22 cm [8.5 inches]), it has a short, sweet song, sometimes uttered at night.
