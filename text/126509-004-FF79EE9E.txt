Chrysler, American automotive company first incorporated as Chrysler Corporation in 1925. It was reorganized and adopted its current name, Chrysler Group LLC, in 2009, and in 2014 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat SpA. It was for many years the third largest (after General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company) of the “Big Three” automakers in the United States.
Chrysler’s origins lie in the Maxwell Motor Company, Inc. (formed in 1913). The first Maxwell car was made in 1904 by Jonathan Maxwell and Benjamin Briscoe, who in 1909 joined the short-lived United States Motor Company. With the collapse of this combine in 1913, Maxwell continued on alone until the postwar recession. In 1920, deeply in debt and facing ruin, the company convinced Walter P. Chrysler, who had resigned from the Buick division of General Motors, to join the effort to revitalize the company. In 1922 the Maxwell company took over Chalmers Motor Car Co. (founded in 1908). In the following year Chrysler bought control. Under Chrysler’s leadership, the company began to manufacture competitive automobiles, beginning with a revolutionary six-cylinder vehicle that was introduced at the 1924 New York Automobile Show. In 1925 the Maxwell Motor Company became the Chrysler Corporation, with Chrysler as president. With the purchase of Dodge Brothers, Inc. (founded in 1914), and the introduction of Plymouth in 1928, the Chrysler Corporation became a major presence in the American automotive industry.
