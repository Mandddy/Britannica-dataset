Motorcycle trial,  either of two forms of motorcycle competition based on point systems, as opposed to a race for a finish line. The first form includes time trials, which are cross-country events over rugged terrain in which riders are issued route and time cards. These are stamped at control points along the course, and contestants lose a point for every two minutes that they are late in arriving at the stations (the standard is determined at the end by the time of the fastest rider). The highest point total wins.
The second form of motorcycle trial includes observation trials, which are run over hazard-strewn terrain, often uphill, that has been divided into observed sections. The goal is to negotiate these sections without losing points for touching the ground with any part of the body (a “dab,” one point), touching twice or more with the body (a “footing,” three points), or failing to complete the section (five points). The rider with the fewest points lost wins. The premier events are the Scottish Six Days Trial and the International Six Days Trial.
