Uragami Gyokudō, also called Hyōuemon Gyokudō   (born 1745, Bizen, Japan—died October 10, 1820, Kyōto) Japanese painter and musician who excelled in depicting scenes of nature realistically and in the art of playing the seven-stringed zither.
The son of a retainer of Lord Ikeda of Okayama, Uragami took zither lessons early in life and continued his musical training after he himself became a retainer. He also studied Confucianism and a southern school of Chinese art with emphasis on scholarly and literary themes. After abruptly resigning his retainership in 1795, he wandered through various parts of Japan and finally settled down in Edo (now Tokyo) to help revive gagaku, or imperial court music. Although self-taught, he became a first-rate painter, gifted enough to carry on the tradition of the school of painting called Nan-ga (“Southern Painting”). He had a keen appreciation of nature, reproducing scenes with an amazing degree of realism. His Snow Sifted Through Frozen Clouds is considered a masterpiece.
