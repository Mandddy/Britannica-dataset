Shot put, sport in athletics (track and field) in which a spherical weight is thrown, or put, from the shoulder for distance. It derives from the ancient sport of putting the stone.
The first to use a shot (cannon ball) instead of a stone competitively were British military sports groups. Although the weight varied in early events from 3.63 to 10.9 kg (8 to 24 pounds), a standard, regulation-weight 7.26-kg (16-pound) shot was adopted for men in the first modern Olympic Games (1896) and in international competition. The event was added to the women’s Olympic program in 1948. The weight of the shot used for women’s competition is 4 kg (8.8 pounds); lighter weights are also used in school, collegiate, and veteran competitions.
