Parashurama, (
        Sanskrit: “Rama with the Ax”) one of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of the Hindu god Vishnu.
The Mahabharata and the Puranas record that Parashurama was born to the Brahman sage Jamadagni and the princess Renuka, a member of the Kshatriya class. When Jamadagni suspected Renuka of an unchaste thought, he ordered Parashurama to cut off her head, which the obedient son did. Later, to avenge the murder of his father by a Kshatriya, he killed all the male Kshatriyas on earth 21 successive times (for, each time, their wives survived and gave birth to new generations) and filled five lakes with their blood. In the Ramayana he encounters another avatar, Rama, who wins the bow of the god Shiva, which Parashurama had given to Rama’s father-in-law. Rama later subdues Parashurama when challenged to a fight. Parashurama is the traditional founder of Malabar and is said to have bestowed land there on members of the priestly class whom he brought down from the north in order to expiate his slaughter of the Kshatriyas. Temples dedicated to Parashurama are found throughout India.
