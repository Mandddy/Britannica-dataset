James G. Blaine, in full James Gillespie Blaine   (born Jan. 31, 1830, West Brownsville, Pa., U.S.—died  Jan. 27, 1893, Washington, D.C.) a leading Republican politician and diplomat for 25 years (1868–93), who was particularly influential in launching the Pan-American Movement with Latin-American countries.
Blaine graduated from Washington (now Washington and Jefferson) College in Washington, Pa., in 1847 and then taught school for the next six years. He moved to Augusta, Maine, in 1854 to become editor and part owner of the Kennebec Journal, a crusading Republican newspaper. In 1856 he attended the first national convention of the newly organized Republican Party. He served in the Maine state legislature from 1858 until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1862. After the Civil War, he favoured a more moderate Reconstruction policy than the radicals of his party, although he was a strong advocate of black suffrage.
