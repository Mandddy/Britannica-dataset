Ravenna, city, Emilia-Romagna regione, northeastern Italy. The city is on a low-lying plain near the confluence of the Ronco and Montone rivers, 6 miles (10 km) inland from the Adriatic Sea, with which it is connected by a canal. Ravenna was important in history as the capital of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century ad and later (6th–8th century) of Ostrogothic and Byzantine Italy.
In ancient times the Adriatic lay nearer Ravenna, which rested on coastal lagoons that later silted up. The earliest inhabitants of Ravenna were probably Italic peoples who moved southward from Aquileia about 1400 bc. According to tradition, it was occupied by the Etruscans and later by the Gauls. It came under Roman control in 191 bc and soon became important because it possessed one of the few good port sites on the northeastern coast of Italy. The Roman emperor Augustus built the port of Classis, about 3 miles (5 km) from the city, and by the 1st century bc Ravenna had become the base for Rome’s naval fleet in the Adriatic Sea.
