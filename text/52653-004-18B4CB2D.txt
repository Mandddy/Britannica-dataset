Mehmed V, original name Mehmed Reşad   (born Nov. 2, 1844, Constantinople—died  July 3, 1918, Constantinople) Ottoman sultan from 1909 to 1918, whose reign was marked by the absolute rule of the Committee of Union and Progress and by Turkey’s defeat in World War I.
Having lived in seclusion most of his life, Mehmed Reşad became sultan after his brother Abdülhamid II was forced to abdicate. A kind and gentle man, educated in traditional Islāmic subjects and Persian literature, he showed a keen interest in Ottoman and Islāmic history; nevertheless, he lacked the ability to govern. Attempting to rule as a constitutional monarch, he surrendered all authority to the Committee of Union and Progress, the liberal–nationalist organization of the Young Turk movement.
