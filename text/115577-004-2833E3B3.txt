Johann Christian Günther,  (born April 8, 1695, Striegau, Silesia—died  March 15, 1723, Jena) one of the most important German lyric poets of the period between the Middle Ages and the early Goethe.
He studied medicine at Wittenberg but after two years of dissolute life went in 1717 to Leipzig, where an effort to procure him the post of stipendiary poet at the Saxon-Polish court at Dresden ended in a fiasco, for which Günther was partly to blame. In 1719 his father, who for long had opposed his son’s poetical ambitions, disinherited him, despite Günther’s pathetic attempts at reconciliation.
