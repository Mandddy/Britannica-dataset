George Colman the Elder,  (born April 1732, Florence [Italy]—died August 14, 1794, London, England) a leading English comic dramatist of his day and an important theatre manager who sought to revive the vigour of Elizabethan drama with adaptations of plays by Beaumont and Fletcher and Ben Jonson.
He was the son of Francis Colman, envoy to the grand duke of Tuscany. After his father’s death in 1733, he became the ward of an uncle, William Pulteney (later 1st earl of Bath). Colman abandoned a legal career for literature and the theatre, and his first play, Polly Honeycombe (1760), satirized the current craze for romantic novels. It was presented as an afterpiece by the great actor-manager David Garrick at London’s Drury Lane Theatre. His next play, The Jealous Wife (1761), an adaptation of Henry Fielding’s novel Tom Jones, was one of the best comedies of the age and held its place in the stock theatrical repertoire for nearly a century. Colman collaborated with Garrick on The Clandestine Marriage (1766), a play blending sentiment with satire, which is still stage-worthy. In 1767 Colman bought a quarter share in Covent Garden theatre, London, which he managed for seven years, during which time he appreciably raised the standard of acting and of drama. In 1776 he bought the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, London, a summer theatre that reached the peak of its fame under his management. In 1785 Colman suffered a stroke, from which he never fully recovered.
