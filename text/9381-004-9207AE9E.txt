Igor Sikorsky, in full Igor Ivan Sikorsky  (born May 25, 1889, Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died October 26, 1972, Easton, Connecticut, U.S.) pioneer in aircraft design who is best known for his successful development of the helicopter.
Sikorsky’s father was a physician and professor of psychology. His mother also was a physician but never practiced professionally. Her great interest in art and in the life and work of Leonardo da Vinci undoubtedly stimulated her son’s early interest in experimenting with model flying machines; when he was 12 years old, he made a small rubber-powered helicopter that could rise in the air.
