Masada, Hebrew H̱orvot Meẕada (“Ruins of Masada”),  ancient mountaintop fortress in southeastern Israel, site of the Jews’ last stand against the Romans after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 ce. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001.
Masada occupies the entire top of an isolated mesa near the southwest coast of the Dead Sea. The rhomboid-shaped mountain towers 1,424 feet (434 metres) above the level of the Dead Sea. It has a summit area of about 18 acres (7 hectares). Some authorities hold that the site was settled at the time of the First Temple (c. 900 bce), but Masada is renowned for the palaces and fortifications of Herod the Great (reigned 37–4 bce), king of Judaea under the Romans, and for its resistance to the Roman siege in 72–73 ce.
