Steven Soderbergh, in full Steven Andrew Soderbergh  (born January 14, 1963, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.) American film director who worked in disparate genres, directing both idiosyncratic independent films and popular box-office successes.
Soderbergh spent much of his adolescence in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father was a professor and administrator at Louisiana State University. Soderbergh enrolled in a film animation course at the university while still a high school student, and it was then that he began making short films. After graduating from high school he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter, but his efforts were met with rejection. A year later he returned to Baton Rouge, where he worked at a video arcade while continuing to write and shoot low-budget short films.
