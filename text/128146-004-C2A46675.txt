Sirius, also called Alpha Canis Majoris or the Dog Star,  brightest star in the night sky, with apparent visual magnitude −1.44. It is a binary star in the constellation Canis Major. The bright component of the binary is a blue-white star 24.7 times as luminous as the Sun. It has a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun and a surface temperature of 9,800 kelvins (K), which is 4,000 K higher than that of the Sun. Its distance from the solar system is about 8.6 light-years, only twice the distance of the nearest known star beyond the Sun. Its name probably comes from a Greek word meaning “sparkling” or “scorching.”
Sirius was known as Sothis to the ancient Egyptians, who were aware that it made its first heliacal rising (i.e., rose just before sunrise) of the year at about the time the annual floods were beginning in the Nile River delta. They long believed that Sothis caused the Nile floods, and they discovered that the heliacal rising of the star occurred at intervals of 365.25 days rather than the 365 days of their calendar year, a correction in the length of the year that was later incorporated in the Julian calendar. Among the ancient Romans, the hottest part of the year was associated with the heliacal rising of the Dog Star, a connection that survives in the expression “dog days.”
