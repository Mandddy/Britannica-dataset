Suzaku, also called Astro-EII,  Japanese-U.S. satellite observatory designed to observe celestial X-ray sources. Suzaku was launched on July 10, 2005, from the Uchinoura Space Center and means “the vermilion bird of the south” in Japanese. It was designed to complement the U.S. Chandra X-Ray Observatory and Europe’s XMM-Newton spacecraft. Suzaku was equipped with X-ray instruments to study hot plasmas that occur in star clusters, around black holes, and in other regions. Among Suzaku’s discoveries was a white dwarf star that emits pulses of X-rays like a pulsar and evidence that cosmic rays are accelerated by magnetic fields in supernova remnants.
