Merrimack River,  stream in the northeastern United States, rising in the White Mountains of central New Hampshire at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers and flowing southward into Massachusetts, then northeastward to its mouth on the Atlantic Ocean. Of its total length of 110 miles (177 km), the lower 22 miles (35 km) are tidal. The main cities along the river—Concord, Manchester, and Nashua in New Hampshire, and Lowell, Lawrence, and Haverhill in Massachusetts—used the Merrimack’s waterpower to produce a large portion of the textiles and hosiery made in New England from about 1850 to the 1930s. While the river remains an important source of waterpower, its valley has become a central artery for tourist travel to the vacation centres in the White Mountains.
