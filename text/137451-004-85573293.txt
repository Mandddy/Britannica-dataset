Martin Scorsese, original name Martin Marcantonio Luciano Scorsese  (born November 17, 1942, Queens, New York, U.S.) American filmmaker known for his harsh, often violent depictions of American culture. From the 1970s Scorsese created a body of work that was ambitious, bold, and brilliant. But even his most acclaimed films are demanding, sometimes unpleasantly intense dramas that have enjoyed relatively little commercial success. Thus, Scorsese bears the not totally undeserved reputation as a cult director who works with big budgets and Hollywood’s most desirable stars. In terms of artistry, he was perhaps the most significant American director of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
Scorsese was a frail, asthmatic child who grew up in the Italian American neighbourhood of Little Italy on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His early interest in film returned after he tried unsuccessfully to enter the Roman Catholic priesthood, and he went on to earn undergraduate (1964) and graduate (1966) degrees in film from New York University, where he subsequently taught. His student films showed a wide range of influences, from foreign classics to Hollywood musicals. Among them were shorts such as What’s a Nice Girl like You Doing in a Place like This? (1963) and It’s Not Just You, Murray! (1964).
