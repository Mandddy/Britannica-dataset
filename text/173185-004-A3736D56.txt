Esther Williams, in full Esther Jane Williams  (born August 8, 1921, Inglewood, California, U.S.—died June 6, 2013, Beverly Hills, California) American swimming champion who became one of the most popular and profitable Hollywood movie stars of the 1940s and ’50s.
Williams was a teenaged swimming champion who set a record for the 100-metre breaststroke in 1939 and won national titles in Seattle, Washington, and Miami, Florida. She won a spot on the 1940 U.S. Olympic team, but the games, which were scheduled to be held in Helsinki, Finland, were cancelled because of the outbreak of World War II. Williams then worked briefly as a model before turning professional swimmer in 1940 when she costarred with Johnny Weissmuller in Billy Rose’s San Francisco Aquacade. While performing in the Aquacade, she was spotted by a Hollywood talent scout, which led to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM patterned Williams’s career after that of the former Olympic figure skater-turned-Hollywood sensation Sonja Henie, promoting Williams as “Hollywood’s Mermaid” and “Queen of the Surf.”
