Originally named Buchtel College after its chief early benefactor, John R. Buchtel, the university was established in 1870 by the Ohio Universalist Convention and opened in 1872. The denominational affiliation was dropped in 1913 when the city took ownership of the school and changed its name to Municipal University of Akron. In 1967 it became a state university. In response to the growth of the city’s rubber industry, the university offered the first collegiate course in rubber chemistry in 1909. It was also one of the first universities to offer cooperative engineering education programs, sending students out to work in local factories. Wayne College, a junior college open since 1972, is affiliated with the University of Akron.
