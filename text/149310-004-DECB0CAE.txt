Farnsworth House, pioneering steel-and-glass house in Plano, Ill., U.S., designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and completed in 1951. The structure’s modern classicism epitomizes the International Style of architecture and Mies’s dictum “less is more.” It is set on the floodplain of the Fox River and is one of only three houses built by Mies in the United States. (The other two are the Robert McCormick house [now part of the Elmhurst Art Museum] in Elmhurst, Ill., and the Morris Greenwald house in Weston, Conn.) The house invites nature in through continuous glass walls and is anchored delicately to the forest floor. The simplicity of the design, precision in detailing, and careful choice of materials made this and others of Mies’s buildings stand out from the mass of midcentury Modernism.
Edith Farnsworth, a medical doctor based in Chicago, commissioned Mies to design a house on the Fox River, 60 miles outside the city. To give the occupant full advantage of the site’s natural beauty, Mies’s design featured an all-glass exterior. Intended as a vacation home or weekend retreat, the house lacked storage space, closets, and other necessities of full-time living, which the architect ignored in favour of an aesthetic perfectionism. A rumoured romance between client and architect reportedly soured as the house was built and cost overruns spurred lawsuits between Farnsworth and Mies. Farnsworth continued to spend weekends in the glass house for the next 20 years, until a nearby bridge and roadway made the setting less bucolic. In 1972 she sold the property to Peter Palumbo (later Lord Palumbo). He held it until 2003, when it was auctioned at Sotheby’s and purchased by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which offers public tours.
