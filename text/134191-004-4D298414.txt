Chern graduated from Nankai University in Tianjin, China, in 1930; he received an M.S. degree in 1934 from Tsinghua University in Beijing and a doctor of sciences degree from the University of Hamburg (Germany) in 1936. A year later he returned to Tsinghua as professor of mathematics. Chern was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey, from 1943 to 1945. In 1946 he returned to China to become acting director of the Institute of Mathematics at the Academia Sinica in Nanjing.
