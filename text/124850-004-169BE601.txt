Lucky Luciano, byname of Charles Luciano, original name Salvatore Lucania  (born Nov. 11, 1896, Lercara Friddi, Sicily, Italy—died Jan. 26, 1962, Naples) the most powerful chief of American organized crime in the early 1930s and a major influence even from prison, 1936–45, and after deportation to Italy in 1946.
Luciano emigrated with his parents from Sicily to New York City in 1906 and, at the age of 10 was already involved in mugging, shoplifting, and extortion; in 1916 he spent six months in jail for selling heroin. Out of jail, he teamed up with Frank Costello and Meyer Lansky and other young gangsters; he earned his nickname “Lucky” for success at evading arrest and winning craps games. In 1920 he joined the ranks of New York’s rising crime boss, Joe Masseria, and by 1925 he had become Masseria’s chief lieutenant, directing bootlegging, prostitution, narcotics distribution, and other rackets. In October 1929 he became the rare gangster to survive a “one-way ride”; he was abducted by four men in a car, beaten, stabbed repeatedly with an ice pick, had his throat slit from ear to ear, and was left for dead on a Staten Island beach—but survived. He never named his abductors. (Soon after, he changed his name to Luciano.)
