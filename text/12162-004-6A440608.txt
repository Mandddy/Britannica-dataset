Eastern red cedar, also called pencil cedar,  (Juniperus virginiana), an evergreen ornamental and timber tree of the cypress family (Cupressaceae), native to poor or limestone soils of eastern North America. An eastern red cedar can grow to 12 to 15 metres (about 40 to 50 feet) tall and 30 to 60 cm (about 1 to 2 feet) in diameter. It has needlelike juvenile foliage and dark green, scalelike mature leaves. The green, fleshy, rounded cones are about 0.7 cm (about 0.25 inch) in diameter. Mature dark blue cones are covered by a gray, waxy material. The fibrous bark may be reddish brown or ashy gray, and it separates into long, fringed scales. The fragrant wood is made into cabinets, fence posts, and pencils. In much of its range, the species invades glades, pastures, prairies, and other open grassy areas, and it is thus considered an undesirable weed by some botanists and land managers.
