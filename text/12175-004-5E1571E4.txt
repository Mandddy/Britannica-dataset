Thomas D’Urfey,  (born 1653, Exeter?, Devon, Eng.—died  February 1723, London) English dramatist, satirist, and songwriter with a light satirical touch whose plays were very popular in their time; his comedies, with complicated plots carried forward by lively dialogue, to some extent pointed the way to sentimental comedy of the later 18th century.
D’Urfey was descended from French Huguenot refugees and was a prolific and adaptable writer. Patronized by King Charles II, whom he entertained as a jester and singer, and more cautiously by James II, D’Urfey changed his religious and political allegiance on the accession of William and Mary and was, in turn, favoured by them. He befriended such literary figures as the essayists Richard Steele and Joseph Addison. D’Urfey wrote 32 plays between 1676 and 1688. Like others, he was attacked by the English bishop Jeremy Collier for the supposed immorality of his plays. He also wrote some 500 songs, many of which were inserted in contemporary ballad operas, and wrote texts to be set to music by Henry Purcell, notably an ode, “The Yorkshire Feast Song,” and an epilogue for Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas. Near the end of his life he published a large popular collection of songs and ballads, Wit and Mirth; or, Pills to Purge Melancholy (1719–20).
