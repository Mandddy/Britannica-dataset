Lee Kernaghan, in full Lee Raymond Kernaghan  (born April 15, 1964, Corryong, Vic., Austl.) Australian popular singer who reinvigorated Australian country music in the 1990s, synthesizing traditional country themes with energetic styles of contemporary rock and roll and images of an evolving Australian rural culture.
Kernaghan was the eldest child of Ray Kernaghan, who rose to great popularity as a country music singer during Lee’s teen years. In the mid-1970s Lee formed his first band with his brother Greg and his sister Tania—the latter of whom also went on to become a successful country singer—and he later wrote two of the songs on his father’s album Jet Set Country (1979). In 1982 Lee received a Star Maker Award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. He released his first single—with “Cheaters” on one side and “Advance Australia Again” on the other—the following year, and in 1986 he and his father represented Australia at the International Country Music Fan Fair in Nashville.
