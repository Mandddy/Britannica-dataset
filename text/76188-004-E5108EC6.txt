Horatio Alger, also called Horatio Alger, Jr.   (born Jan. 13, 1832, Chelsea, Mass., U.S.â€”died July 18, 1899, Natick, Mass.) one of the most popular American authors in the last 30 years of the 19th century and perhaps the most socially influential American writer of his generation.
Alger was the son of a Unitarian minister, Horatio Alger, Sr., who tutored him in reading from the age of six. The young Alger showed an interest in writing, and at Harvard University he distinguished himself in the classics and graduated in 1852 with Phi Beta Kappa honours. After leaving Harvard, Alger worked as a schoolteacher and contributed to magazines. In 1857 he enrolled in the Harvard Divinity School, from which he took his degree in 1860. He then took a seven-month tour of Europe and returned to the United States shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War. During the war he was rejected for army service.
