Boreas,  in Greek mythology, the personification of the north wind. He carried off the beautiful Oreithyia, a daughter of Erechtheus, king of Athens; they lived in Thrace as king and queen of the winds and had two sons, Calais and Zetes, and two daughters, Cleopatra and Chione. To show friendliness toward the Athenians, Herodotus wrote, Boreas wrecked the fleet of the Persian king Xerxes off the beach Sepias in Thessaly; in return the Athenians built him a sanctuary or altar near the Ilissus and held a festival in his honour. In works of art Boreas was represented as winged, bearded, and powerful; he wears a short, pleated tunic.
