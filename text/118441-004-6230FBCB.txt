Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin,  (born Oct. 27 [Oct. 15, Old Style], 1855, Vershino estate, near Dolgoye, Russia—died  June 7, 1935, Michurinsk, Russian S.F.S.R.) Russian horticulturist who earned the praise of the Soviet government by developing more than 300 new types of fruit trees and berries in an attempt to prove the inheritance of acquired characteristics. When Mendelian genetics came under attack in the Soviet Union, Michurin’s theories of hybridization, as elaborated by T.D. Lysenko, were adopted as the official science of genetics by the Soviet regime, despite the nearly universal rejection of this doctrine by scientists throughout the world.
