Henry Blake Fuller,  (born January 9, 1857, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died July 28, 1929, Chicago) American novelist who wrote about his native city of Chicago.
Fuller came from a prosperous Chicago family and attended the city’s schools. After a foray into business he lived for a year abroad, mostly in Italy, to which he returned several times. His first two novels—The Chevalier of Pensieri-Vani (1890; written under the pseudonym Stanton Page) and The Chatelaine of La Trinité (1892)—were gracefully told, brief but unhurried tales about Europe.
