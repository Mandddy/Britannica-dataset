Adolf Erik, Baron Nordenskiöld, in full Nils Adolf Erik, Baron Nordenskiöld   (born November 18, 1832, Helsinki, Finland—died August 12, 1901, Dalbyö, Sweden) Swedish geologist, mineralogist, geographer, and explorer who sailed from Norway to the Pacific across the Asiatic Arctic, completing the first successful navigation of the Northeast Passage.
In 1858 Nordenskiöld settled in Stockholm, joined an expedition to the Arctic island of Spitsbergen, between Norway and Greenland, and became professor and curator of mineralogy at the Swedish State Museum. He returned to Spitsbergen again in 1861 and led his own expeditions there in 1864, 1868, and 1872–73, adding to geologic knowledge of the area. In 1870 he also led an expedition to western Greenland to study the inland ice.
