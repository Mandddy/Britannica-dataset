Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, in full Jeffery Amherst, 5th duke de Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, also called (1761–87) Sir Jeffery Amherst   (born Jan. 29, 1717, Sevenoaks, Kent, Eng.—died  Aug. 3, 1797, Sevenoaks) army commander who captured Canada for Great Britain (1758–60) during the French and Indian War (1754–63). Amherst, Mass., and several other American and Canadian places are named for him.
Amherst received a commission in the foot guards in 1731 and was selected as aide-de-camp first by Lord Ligonier and then by the duke of Cumberland. William Pitt and Ligonier selected him for the Canadian command in 1758. With a force of 14,000 men, he besieged and captured Louisbourg (on Cape Breton Island) and was promoted to chief command in America. He then drew up a plan for a concentric advance on Montreal by three columns, one moving westward up the St. Lawrence River and capturing Quebec, the second northward from Albany by Ticonderoga and Crown Point, and the third eastward from Fort Niagara. The first column, under the command of James Wolfe, captured Quebec in 1759, and the final offensive was launched in 1760, when Montreal surrendered and Canada passed into British hands.
