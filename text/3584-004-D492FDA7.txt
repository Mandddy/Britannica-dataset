Portland Vase, Roman vase (1st century ad) of dark blue glass decorated with white figures, the finest surviving Roman example of cameo glass. Originally owned by the Barberini family (and sometimes called the Barberini Vase), it came into the possession of the duchess of Portland in the 18th century. The vase has been extensively copied, particularly during the Victorian period. The most accurate copies, however, were those made by Josiah Wedgwood, who, in 1790, copied it in jasperware with white figures in relief, and by John Northwood of Stourbridge, Eng., who copied it in glass (completed 1876). In 1845, while in the British Museum (where it is now), the original vase was smashed, necessitating skillful and painstaking restoration.
