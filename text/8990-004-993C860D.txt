George Carew, earl of Totnes, also called (1586–1605) Sir George Carew or (1605–26) Baron Carew of Clopton  (born May 29, 1555—died  March 27, 1629, London, Eng.) English soldier, administrator, and antiquary noted for his service in Ireland during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England.
He was the son of George Carew, dean of Windsor. In 1574 he went to Ireland as a soldier and distinguished himself in 1577 in defending Leighlin Castle, County Carlow, from the Irish rebels. Well liked by Elizabeth and the powerful Cecil family, he was in 1586 knighted and made master of the ordnance in Ireland. He became lieutenant general of the ordnance in England in 1592, in which capacity he accompanied Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, on the English naval raid on Cádiz, Spain, in 1596 and on the expedition to the Azores in 1597. In 1598 he attended Sir Robert Cecil, the ambassador, to France. He was appointed treasurer at war to Essex in Ireland in March 1599, and, on the latter’s sudden departure in September of the same year, leaving the island in disorder, Carew was appointed a lord justice.
