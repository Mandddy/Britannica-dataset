Dorothy Fields,  (born July 15, 1905, Allenhurst, N.J., U.S.—died March 28, 1974, New York, N.Y.) American songwriter who collaborated with a number of Broadway’s top composers during the heyday of American musical theatre, producing the lyrics for many classic shows.
Fields was the daughter of Lew M. Fields of the vaudeville comedy team of Weber and Fields. After graduating from high school in New York City, she taught drama and published a few poems in magazines before she found her career. Her lyrics for Jimmy McHugh’s song “Our American Girl” led to their successful collaboration on Blackbirds of 1928, a lavish Cotton Club show featuring “I Can’t Give You Anything but Love, Baby” and “Diga Diga Doo.”
