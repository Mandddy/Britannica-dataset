Tokugawa Yoshinobu, original name Tokugawa Keiki   (born Oct. 28, 1837, Edo, Japan—died  Jan. 22, 1913, Tokyo) the last Tokugawa shogun of Japan, who helped make the Meiji Restoration (1868)—the overthrow of the shogunate and restoration of power to the emperor—a relatively peaceful transition.
Born into the ruling Tokugawa family, Keiki was the son of Tokugawa Nariaki, who was the head of the feudal fief of Mito. The Hitotsubashi family, a Tokugawa branch that, like the Mito extension, was eligible to succeed to the shogunate, had no male heirs during this period. Thus, when Keiki, seventh son of Nariaki, was adopted into the Hitotsubashi family, he greatly increased his chance to succeed to the shogunate. When the shogun Tokugawa Iesada died without heir in 1858, Nariaki attempted to push his son’s candidacy as a way of implementing his own reformist policies. A more moderate group prevailed, however, and an infant boy (Tokugawa Iemochi) was chosen as the new shogun. Keiki and his father, along with other radicals, were forced into domiciliary confinement.
