Uranus, seventh planet in distance from the Sun and the least massive of the solar system’s four giant, or Jovian, planets, which also include Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. At its brightest, Uranus is just visible to the unaided eye as a blue-green point of light. It is designated by the symbol ♅.
Uranus is named for the personification of heaven and the son and husband of Gaea in Greek mythology. It was discovered in 1781 with the aid of a telescope, the first planet to be found that had not been recognized in prehistoric times. Uranus actually had been seen through the telescope several times over the previous century but dismissed as another star. Its mean distance from the Sun is nearly 2.9 billion km (1.8 billion miles), more than 19 times as far as is Earth, and it never approaches Earth more closely than about 2.7 billion km (1.7 billion miles). Its relatively low density (only about 1.3 times that of water) and large size (four times the radius of Earth) indicate that, like the other giant planets, Uranus is composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, water, and other volatile compounds; also like its kin, Uranus has no solid surface. Methane in the Uranian atmosphere absorbs the red wavelengths of sunlight, giving the planet its blue-green colour.Planetary data for Uranus      mean distance from Sun 2,870,658,000 km (19.2 AU)   eccentricity of orbit 0.0472   inclination of orbit to ecliptic 0.77°   Uranian year (sidereal period of revolution) 84.02 Earth years   visual magnitude at mean opposition 5.5   mean synodic period* 369.66 Earth days   mean orbital velocity 6.80 km/sec   equatorial radius** 25,559 km   polar radius** 24,973 km   mass 8.681 x 1025 kg   mean density 1.27 g/cm3   gravity** 887 cm/sec2   escape velocity** 21.3 km/sec   rotation period (magnetic field) 17 hr 14 min (retrograde)   inclination of equator to orbit 97.8°   magnetic field strength at equator 0.23 gauss   tilt angle of magnetic axis 58.6°   offset of magnetic axis 0.31 of Uranus’s radius   number of known moons 27   planetary ring system 13 known rings   *Time required for the planet to return to the same position in the sky relative to the Sun as seen from Earth. **Calculated for the altitude at which 1 bar of atmospheric pressure is exerted.
