Oslo, formerly (1624–1877) Christiania or (1877–1925) Kristiania,  capital and largest city of Norway. It lies at the head of Oslo Fjord in the southeastern part of the country. The original site of Oslo was east of the Aker River. The city was founded by King Harald Hardraade about 1050, and about 1300 the Akershus fortress was built by Haakon V. After the city was destroyed by fire in 1624, Christian IV of Denmark-Norway built a new town farther west, under the walls of the Akershus fortress, and called it Christiania. The growth of Christiania’s population in the 19th century was due in part to the absorption of surrounding municipalities, and the city replaced its rival, the west-coast port of Bergen, as Norway’s largest and most influential city.
The city was renamed Oslo in 1925 and developed rapidly after World War II. In 1948 Oslo incorporated the nearby township of Aker, and in the following decades a number of satellite towns and residential areas grew up to the east and west of the city. On July 22, 2011, the city centre was the target of a massive bomb attack that damaged government buildings, including the prime minister’s office. Eight people were killed and dozens were injured in the blast.
