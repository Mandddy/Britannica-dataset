Ed Miliband, in full Edward Samuel Miliband  (born December 24, 1969, London, England) British politician who served as leader of the Labour Party (2010–15).
Miliband was the son of Jewish (and Marxist) refugees who had survived the Holocaust during World War II. Ralph Miliband, who had fled Belgium in 1940, became a prominent Marxist intellectual in London, where he met and married Marion Kozak, who had been sheltered by a Roman Catholic family in Poland throughout the war. Their sons, David and Ed, thus grew up in a household in which intense political debate was seldom absent for long. Ed followed his brother to Haverstock Comprehensive School and then to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to study politics, philosophy, and economics before forging his own path with a master’s degree from the London School of Economics. In 1993, after a brief period as a television researcher, he started working for Labour Party MP Harriet Harman.
