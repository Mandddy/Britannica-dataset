Tsavo National Park, national park, southeastern Kenya, east of Mount Kilimanjaro. The largest (8,036 square miles [20,812 square km]) of Kenyaâ€™s national parks, it was established in 1948. Later that year, for administrative purposes, the park was divided into two smaller units: Tsavo East and Tsavo West. Drained by the Tsavo and Galana rivers, and the Tiva River in the north, the park comprises semiarid plains covered by dormant vegetation (which bursts into luxuriant bloom after a light rain) and acacia and baobab trees. Tsavo East is relatively flat, while Tsavo West is volcanic and dotted with springs and water holes. Wildlife includes elephants, as well as lions, rhinoceroses, buffalo, hippopotamuses, hartebeests and several other species of antelope, and hundreds of species of birds. Poaching, particularly for rhinoceroses and elephants, and brush fires are constant problems. Tsavo East and Tsavo West are separated by the Nairobi-Mombasa highway and railway line.
