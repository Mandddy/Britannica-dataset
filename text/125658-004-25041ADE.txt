Robber crab (Birgus latro), also called coconut crab,  large nocturnal land crab of the southwest Pacific and Indian oceans. It is closely related to the hermit crab and king crab. All are decapod crustaceans (order Decapoda, class Crustacea). Adult robber crabs are about 1 metre (about 40 inches) from leg tip to leg tip and weigh about 4.5 kg (10 pounds). The full-grown adult ranges in colouring from light violet to brown and deep purple. Young adults are brown, with black stripes on their legs.
Though the robber crab is known in popular lore for its ability to use its massive pincers (chelae) to crack open coconuts, it is likely that this is a myth. While the robber crab will feed on meat from coconuts that have already cracked or been opened by other animals, studies of captive crabs have demonstrated that the creatures do not possess the strength to penetrate the tough husk and shell themselves. Rather, they are generalist scavengers that feed on fallen fruit, carrion, and, to ingest calcium, the shells of other crabs.
