Norman Douglas, in full George Norman Douglas  (born December 8, 1868, Thüringen, Austria—died February 9, 1952, Capri, Italy) essayist and novelist who wrote of southern Italy, where he lived for many years, latterly on the island of Capri—the setting of his most famous book, South Wind. All his books, whether fiction, topography, essays, or autobiography, have a charm arising from Douglas’s uninhibited expression of a bohemian, aristocratic personality. His prose is considered somewhat near the perfection of the conversational style.
Douglas was born of an old Scottish landowning family, which had intermarried with German aristocrats, and he attended the Gymnasium at Karlsruhe, Germany, where he showed a precocious gift for both languages and natural science. He entered the British Foreign Office in 1893 but spent only about three years on diplomatic service (in Russia), after which he travelled widely in India, Italy, and North Africa.
