Boston terrier, breed of dog developed in the latter half of the 19th century in Boston. Bred from the English bulldog and a white English terrier, the Boston terrier is one of the few breeds to have originated in the United States. It has a terrier-like build, dark eyes, a short muzzle, and a short, fine coat of black or brindle, with white on the face, chest, neck, and legs. At maturity, it stands 15 to 17 inches (38 to 43 cm); weight may range from less than 15 to about 25 pounds (7 to 11 kg). The breed is characteristically gentle and affectionate.
