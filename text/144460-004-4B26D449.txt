Pyrrhotite,  iron sulfide mineral (Fe1â€“xS) in the niccolite group; in it, the ratio of iron to sulfur atoms is variable but is usually slightly less than one. It commonly is found with pentlandite and other sulfides in silica-poor igneous rocks, as at Kongsberg, Nor.; Andreas-Berg, Ger.; Trentino, Italy; and Sudbury, Ont. The variety troilite, with a composition near that of iron sulfide (FeS), is an important constituent of some meteorites. The crystals possess hexagonal symmetry; for detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
