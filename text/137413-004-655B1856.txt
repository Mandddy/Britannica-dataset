Frogmouth (family Podargidae), any of numerous birds, comprising the family Podargidae in the order Caprimulgiformes, named for their characteristic broad, froglike gape. Frogmouths inhabit the forests of southeastern Asia and Australia. Unlike the weak bill of the nightjars, that of the frogmouths is substantial and slightly hooked. Their food consists of large insects, small lizards, and mice, taken at night; some frogmouths in Australia also eat berries and fruit. They sleep in a crouching position, lengthwise along a branch, during the day. Frogmouths are protectively coloured, reddish brown or grayish, and range in length from about 10 to 22 inches (25 to 55 cm). There are 12 species in two genera.
The large frogmouth (Batrachostomus auritus), a 16-inch (40-cm) species of the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra and Borneo, lays a single egg on a pad of down covered with lichens and spiderwebs. The tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides), of the Australian mainland and Tasmania, is about 20 inches (50 cm) long. It lays two or three eggs on a flimsy nest of twigs in the crotch of a tree. Other species occur in the Philippines, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.
