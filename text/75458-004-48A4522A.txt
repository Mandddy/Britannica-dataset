K-selected species, also called K-strategist,  species whose populations fluctuate at or near the carrying capacity (K) of the environment in which they reside. Such species make up one of the two generalized life-history strategies posited by American ecologist Robert MacArthur and American biologist Edward O. Wilson; r-selected species—that is, species whose populations are governed by their biotic potential (maximum reproductive capacity)—make up the second strategy.
K-selected species possess relatively stable populations and tend to produce relatively low numbers of offspring; however, individual offspring tend to be quite large in comparison with r-selected species. K-selected species are characterized by long gestation periods lasting several months, slow maturation (and thus extended parental care), and long life spans. In addition, they tend to inhabit relatively stable biological communities, such as late-successional or climax forests (see ecological succession).
