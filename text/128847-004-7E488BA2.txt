Triconodon, genus of extinct mammals found in European deposits of the late Jurassic Period (about 161 million–146 million years ago). Triconodon is representative of the triconodonts, known from fossils throughout North America, Europe, Africa, and China. Triconodon, being about the size of a domestic cat, was relatively large for its time, since most early mammals were very small. Its brain was smaller than that of most living mammals. The canine teeth were large and strongly developed, so it is probable that Triconodon was an active predator. The premolars are simple, but the molars—for which the genus is named—have three distinctive cone-shaped cusps.
