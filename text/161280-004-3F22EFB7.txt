Eastland disaster, capsizing of the passenger liner SS Eastland on the Chicago River in Chicago on July 24, 1915. The event, which claimed at least 844 lives, ranks as one of the worst maritime disasters in American history. It also is among the city’s deadliest catastrophes: hundreds more lives were lost in the Eastland disaster than in the Chicago fire of 1871.
Early on the morning of July 24, thousands of people gathered in the rain for the fifth annual picnic for the employees of the Western Electric Company. The retreat was scheduled to begin with a boat ride from Chicago across Lake Michigan to Michigan City, Indiana. About 6:30 am passengers began boarding the Eastland—one of five boats chartered for the excursion—at a dock in downtown Chicago. The liner, which had been built in 1902, was known as the “Speed Queen of the Great Lakes.” It also had a history of being unstable, nearly capsizing on several previous occasions.
