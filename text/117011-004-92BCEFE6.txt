Founded in 1863, Kansas State was one of the first land-grant universities established under the Morrill Act of 1862. It initially occupied the vacant campus of the Bluemont Central College, moving to its current site in 1875. The university, originally named Kansas State Agricultural College, was coeducational from the outset. The Salina campus was created in 1991 after the merger of the Kansas College of Technology with Kansas State.
