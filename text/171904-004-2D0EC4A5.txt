Sir Maui Pomare, in full Sir Maui Wiremu Pita Naera Pomare   (born January 13, 1876, Pahou Pa, New Zealand—died June 27, 1930, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) Maori statesman and physician whose public health work helped revive New Zealand’s Maori population, which had declined nearly to extinction by the late 19th century.
Pomare was educated at Te Aute College in Hawkes Bay, where he helped form the Young Maori Party. He became a Maori health officer in 1900 and worked to improve medical care and hygiene in Maori settlements in an effort to overcome resistance to European medical practices. Largely through Pomare’s efforts, the Tohunga Suppression Act (1907) was passed, which prohibited unqualified medical treatment in native communities.
