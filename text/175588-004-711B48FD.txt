The Nutty Professor, American screwball comedy, released in 1963, that was a variation of the classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme. It is considered to be a highlight in the film career of Jerry Lewis.
Lewis played nerdy accident-prone professor Julius Kelp, who has grown tired of being mocked for his social awkwardness and skinny physique. Deciding that exercise is not the answer, Kelp creates a potion that transforms him into Buddy Love, a handsome, conceited playboy. Though this alter ego is an instant social success, the potion has a tendency to wear off quickly, complicating Loveâ€™s pursuit of a lovely young coed (played by Stella Stevens).
