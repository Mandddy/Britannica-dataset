Coati (genus Nasua), also called coatimundi or coatimondi,  any of three species of omnivore related to raccoons (family Procyonidae). Coatis are found in wooded regions from the southwestern United States through South America.
The coati has a long, flexible snout and a slender, darkly banded tail that it often carries erect as it moves about. It has coarse fur that is gray to reddish or brown with lighter underparts and light facial markings. The male coati measures about 73 to 136 cm (29 to 54 inches) in length—half of which is tail—and weighs roughly 4.5 to 11 kg (10 to 24 pounds). The female is somewhat smaller.
