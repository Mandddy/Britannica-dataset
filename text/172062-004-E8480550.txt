Antoine Pevsner, original name Natan Borisovich Pevzner  (born January 18, 1886, Oryol, Russia—died April 12, 1962, Paris, France) Russian-born French sculptor and painter who—like his brother, Naum Gabo—advanced the Constructivist style.
Pevsner studied art in Russia at Kiev and St. Petersburg. In 1911 and 1913 he visited Paris, where he was influenced by Cubism; he subsequently introduced Cubist techniques of geometric simplification into his own paintings. To avoid serving in the Russian imperial army, in 1915 he joined his brother Naum Gabo in Oslo, Norway. There they experimented with art that was “capable of utilizing emptiness and liberating us from the compact mass.” Gabo created his first abstract constructions, while Pevsner continued to work with Cubist approaches to representational painting.
