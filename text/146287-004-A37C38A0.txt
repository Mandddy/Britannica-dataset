New York City Marathon, 26.2-mile footrace held every November through the five boroughs of New York City. The New York City Marathon often draws the largest number of participants of all annual marathons, and it is—with the Berlin, Boston, Chicago, London, and Tokyo marathons—one of the world’s six major marathons.
The first New York City Marathon was held in 1970, and the route consisted of a series of laps through Manhattan’s Central Park. The course took on its current shape, which begins on Staten Island and ends in Manhattan, in 1976. Norway’s Grete Waitz won the women’s New York City Marathon a record nine times, and American Bill Rogers holds the men’s record with four wins.
