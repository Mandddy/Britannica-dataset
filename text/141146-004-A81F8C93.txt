Victoria Nile, river in Uganda that forms the upper section of the Nile River, flowing some 300 miles (480 km). It issues from the northern end of Lake Victoria at Ripon Falls (now submerged), west of Jinja, and flows northwest over the Nalubaale and Kiira dams at Owen Falls, through Lake Kyoga, and past Masindi Port and Atura. In its lower course the Victoria Nile is impeded by a series of rapids culminating in the Kabalega (Murchison) Falls on the edge of the Western Rift Valley. At the northern end of Lake Albert (Lake Mobutu Sese Seko) it forms a swampy estuary. Navigation is possible only on Lake Kyoga between Namasagali and Masindi Port.
