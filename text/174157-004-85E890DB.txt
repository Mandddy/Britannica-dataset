Elisabet Ney, in full Franzisca Bernadina Wilhelmina Elisabeth Ney  (born January 26, 1833, Münster, Westphalia, Prussia [now in Germany]—died June 29, 1907, Austin, Texas, U.S.) sculptor remembered for her statues and busts of European and Texas personages of the mid- to late 19th century.
Ney was the daughter of a stonecutter, and from him she inherited artistic ambitions. She studied drawing privately in her home city of Münster and at the Royal Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, Germany. In 1855 she went to Berlin to study with the noted sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch, through whom she was introduced to the literati and cultural leaders of that city. Ney exhibited her work successfully at the Berlin Exposition of 1856, and on the death of Rauch the following year she took over some of his unfinished commissions. She established her fame with busts of the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, a personal friend, and of King George V of Hanover. In 1863, after three years in Münster working on a number of busts and statues, she married Edmund Duncan Montgomery, whom she had met as a student in Munich; a staunch feminist, she retained her own name.
