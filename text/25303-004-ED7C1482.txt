Peter Minuit, Minuit also spelled Minnewit  (born c. 1580, Wesel, Kleve [Germany]—died June 1638, Caribbean Sea) Dutch colonial governor of New Amsterdam who is mainly remembered for his fabulous purchase of Manhattan Island (the nucleus of New York City) from the Indians for trade goods worth a mere 60 guilders.
Though probably of French or Walloon ancestry, Minuit wrote in Dutch (Netherlandic) and was a deacon in the local Dutch Church in his hometown of Wesel (now in Germany). In 1625 he left Wesel, perhaps in flight from the Spanish who had occupied the town, and from Holland he sailed to the Dutch colony of New Netherland. He apparently returned to Holland the same year, for in January 1626 he sailed westward again, arriving at the mouth of the Hudson River on May 4, 1626. On September 23 the Dutch West India Company named him director general of the colony on Manhattan. To legitimize European occupation of the territory, he met with Indian sachems (variously characterized by historians as having belonged to the Lenape, Delaware, Munsee, or Algonquin people) and persuaded them to transfer “ownership” (a concept that was foreign to Native Americans when relating to land) of the entire island to the settlers. According to legend, the “purchase” was made for glass beads. Glass beads were an important trading item, but while the deal almost certainly involved trade goods, there is no historical evidence that beads were used. Historical records, on the other hand, indicate that the island was purchased for “the value of 60 guilders” (with the often-cited equivalance of $24 first introduced in an account from 1846). On the southern tip he founded New Amsterdam, building a fort around which the early Dutch settlers could make their homes.
