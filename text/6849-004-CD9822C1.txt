Negro River, Portuguese Rio Negro, Spanish Río Negro,  major tributary of the Amazon. It originates in several headstreams, including the Vaupés (Mapés) and the Guainía, which rise in the rain forest of eastern Colombia. The Guainía flows east and then arches northeast and southeast, forming the Colombian–Venezuelan border. Below its junction near San Carlos de Río Negro with the Brazo Casiquiare, a natural waterway that brings water from the Orinoco River in Venezuela, the river acquires the name Negro and enters Brazil. The Negro meanders generally east-southeastward, picking up the Branco River and other tributaries, to Manaus. There it joins the Solimões River to form the Amazon. Its length is about 1,400 miles (2,250 km), of which 850 miles (1,370 km) are in Brazil. It is navigable for about 450 miles (725 km) above its mouth. Although settlement along its banks is sparse, the river is a major transportation artery.
The clear jet-black colour of the Negro’s water, whence comes the river’s name, is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in marginal swamps and its low silt content. The black waters contrast dramatically with the yellowish silt-laden waters of the Branco and with the Amazon.
