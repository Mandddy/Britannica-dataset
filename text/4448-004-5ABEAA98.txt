Simon Stevin,  (born 1548, Bruges—died  1620, The Hague or Leiden, Neth.) Flemish mathematician who helped standardize the use of decimal fractions and aided in refuting Aristotle’s doctrine that heavy bodies fall faster than light ones.
Stevin was a merchant’s clerk in Antwerp for a time and eventually rose to become commissioner of public works and quartermaster general of the army under Prince Maurice of Nassau. He engineered a system of sluices to flood certain areas and drive off any enemy, an important defense of Holland. He also invented a 26-passenger carriage with sails for use along the seashore.
