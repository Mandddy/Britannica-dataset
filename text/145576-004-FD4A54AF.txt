Alma Bridwell White, née Mollie Alma Bridwell   (born June 16, 1862, Kinniconick, Lewis county, Ky., U.S.—died June 26, 1946, Zarephath, N.J.)  American religious leader who was a founder and major moving force in the evangelical Methodist Pentecostal Union Church, which split from mainstream Methodism in the early 20th century.
Alma Bridwell grew up in a dour family of little means. She studied at the Millersburg (Kentucky) Female College and in 1882 moved to Bannack, Montana Territory, where she taught school for a time. In 1887 she married Kent White, a Methodist seminarian. In a succession of small, out-of-the-way pastorates in Colorado, she led hymns and prayers and occasionally preached. Her tall, homely appearance and commanding voice proved of great effect, and she soon discovered the ability to move congregations to tears or to shouts of joy.
