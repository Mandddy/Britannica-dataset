Johnny Unitas, byname of John Constantine Unitas, also called Johnny U  (born May 7, 1933, Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.—died Sept. 11, 2002, Timonium, Md.) American professional gridiron football player who is considered to be one of the greatest all-time National Football League (NFL) quarterbacks.
Unitas excelled in football at St. Justin’s High School in Pittsburgh, but his slight stature (he weighed only 145 pounds [66 kg]) prevented him from earning an athletic scholarship to the University of Notre Dame. He instead played for the University of Louisville (Kentucky), where he grew to 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres) and 190 pounds (86 kg). Unitas became Louisville’s starting quarterback during his freshman season, but he played on mediocre teams throughout his collegiate career and was not considered a great pro prospect upon his graduation. He was selected by the NFL’s Pittsburgh Steelers in the ninth round of the 1955 draft but was released before the regular season began. He worked at construction jobs and played for a semiprofessional team in the Pittsburgh area for $6 a game until he was signed by the Baltimore Colts in 1956.
