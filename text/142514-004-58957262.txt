Myspace, social networking Web site owned by online advertising company Specific Media and singer Justin Timberlake and headquartered in Beverly Hills, Calif.
Myspace is a free, advertising-supported service that allows users to create Web “profile” pages that feature photographs, express their interests, and, most importantly, link to other people’s profiles. The site can be used to keep in touch with friends, “meet” and become friends with new people, or find potential romantic partners. Members must be at least 13 years old, and the profiles of members younger than 16 cannot be viewed by members older than 18, in order to reduce access by potential sexual predators.
