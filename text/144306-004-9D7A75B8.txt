Palpation, medical diagnostic examination with the hands to discover internal abnormalities. By palpation the physician may detect enlargement of an organ, excess fluid in the tissues, a tumour mass, a bone fracture, or, by revealing tenderness, the presence of inflammation (as in appendicitis). Irregular heartbeat or vibrations of the chest can sometimes be diagnosed by palpation.
