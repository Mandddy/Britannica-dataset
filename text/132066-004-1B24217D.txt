Pâté,  (French: “paste”), in French cuisine, a filled pastry, analogous to the English pie. The term pâté is also used, with modifiers, to denote two other distinct preparations: pâté en terrine, a meat, game, or fish mixture wrapped in suet or other animal fat or lining and cooked in a deep oval or oblong dish, without pastry, and served cold; and pâté en croûte, a meat, game, or fish filling cooked in a crust and served hot or cold. It is from pâté en terrine, more properly abbreviated terrine, that the pâté of British and American usage derives.
Certain pâtés are traditionally associated in France with specific occasions. The Pâté de Pâques, for example, which is filled with either ground meat, slices of pork, chicken, or rabbit, and hard-boiled egg slices, is an Easter specialty of the Poitou region. Pâté de foie gras, a pastry that is filled with liver of specially fattened goose or duck, is a world-renowned delicacy.
