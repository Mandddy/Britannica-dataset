Pirithous, also spelled Peirithous,  in Greek mythology, the son of Ixion and the companion and helper of the hero Theseus in his many adventures, including the descent into Hades to carry off Persephone, the daughter of the goddess Demeter. They were detained in Hades until the Greek hero Heracles rescued Theseus but not Pirithous.
Pirithous originally belonged to the Lapiths, a northern mountain tribe, and probably his earliest legend was that of his marriage to Hippodamia (daughter of Butes the beemaster). The Centaurs, who had come to the wedding as guests, in drunken fury tried to violate the bride and her attendants; this led to the battle of the Lapiths and the Centaurs, a favourite subject of Greek art.
