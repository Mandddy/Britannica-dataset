Theodor Benfey,  (born Jan. 28, 1809, Nörten, near Göttingen, Hanover [Germany]—died  June 26, 1881, Göttingen, Ger.) German scholar of Sanskrit and comparative linguistics whose works, particularly his edition of the ancient collection of Indian animal fables known as the Pañca-tantra, contributed in a major way to Sanskrit studies.
Concerned initially with research in classical languages, Benfey worked, while settled as a teacher at Frankfurt am Main (1830–32), on translating the comedies of the Roman playwright Terence. In 1834 he became a Privatdozent at the University of Göttingen and began teaching classical-language studies. While increasingly occupied with Sanskrit, he published a lexicon of Greek roots (1839–42) and a study of the relation of Semitic and Egyptian languages (1844). In 1848 he became an assistant professor and published an edition and translation with glossary of the Sāmaveda, or ancient Vedic religious chants. Two works by Benfey on Sanskrit grammar (1852–54 and 1858) were followed by his edition and translation of the Pañca-tantra (1859), which included a commentary that proved to be a valuable contribution to comparative literature. Appointed professor in 1862, he next published a Sanskrit grammar in English (1863–66) and a Sanskrit-English dictionary (1866). Benfey’s final significant work was Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft und orientalischen Philologie in Deutschland seit dem Anfange des 19. Jahrhunderts (1869; “History of Linguistics and Oriental Philology in Germany Since the Beginning of the 19th Century).
