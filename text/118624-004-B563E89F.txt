Niccolò dell’Arca, also called Niccolò d’Apulia, Niccolò da Ragusa, Nichollò de Bari, and Nicolaus de Apulia  (born c. 1435–40—died 1494, Bologna) early Renaissance sculptor famed for his intensely expressionistic use of realism combined with southern Classicism and a plastic naturalism typical of the Burgundian School and especially the work of Claus Sluter. The Ragusa, Bari, and Apulia variants of his name suggest that he might have come from southern Italy.
Niccolò takes his name from the monumental tomb (arca in Italian) of St. Dominic in the church of San Domenico, Bologna, where he made the canopy and most of the freestanding figures (1469–94). Three of the figures were later added by Michelangelo. His most famous work, the passionately dramatic Lamentation over the Dead Christ (seven freestanding polychrome terra-cotta figures, Santa Maria della Vita, Bologna, completed either 1462–63 or c. 1485) may have been inspired by similar groups by Guido Mazzoni.
