Nap Lajoie, in full Napoleon Lajoie  (born September 5, 1874, Woonsocket, Rhode Island, U.S.—died February 7, 1959, Daytona Beach, Florida) American professional baseball player who was one of the game’s best hitters and an outstanding fielder. Lajoie had a .338 career batting average, the second highest ever for a second baseman, with 3,242 hits, the 14th highest total in major league history.
Lajoie’s formal education ended by age 11, when his father’s unexpected death forced him to find work at a textile mill. As a young adult, he worked as a livery driver and played semiprofessional baseball on the weekends. His exploits on the diamond drew the attention of major league scouts, and he was signed by the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League (NL) in 1896.
