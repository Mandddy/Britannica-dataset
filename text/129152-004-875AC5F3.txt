International Council of Women (ICW), organization, founded in 1888, that works with agencies around the world to promote health, peace, equality, and education.
Founded by Susan B. Anthony, May Wright Sewell, and Frances Willard, among others, the ICW held its first convention March 25–April 1, 1888, in Washington, D.C. Nine countries—England, Ireland, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, India, Canada, and the United States—sent 49 delegates. Though the council’s primary goal was the advancement of women, it did not demand woman suffrage so as not to alienate the more conservative members. A constitution was drafted with international assemblies to be held every five years and national meetings occurring every three. The early international conferences were extensively covered by the press, especially the 1899 meeting in which Anthony met Queen Victoria.
