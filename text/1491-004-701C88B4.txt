Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, annual dogsled race run in March between Anchorage and Nome, Alaska, U.S. The race can attract more than 100 participants and their teams of dogs, and both male and female mushers (drivers) compete together. A short race of about 25 miles (40 km) was organized in 1967 as part of the centennial celebration of the Alaska Purchase and evolved in 1973 into the current race. The architects of the race were Dorothy G. Page, chairman of one of Alaska’s centennial committees, and Joe Redington, Sr., a musher and kennel owner; they are known as the mother and father of the Iditarod. Enthusiasts call it the “last great race on Earth.”
The course of the race, roughly 1,100 miles (1,770 km) long, partially follows the old Iditarod Trail dogsled mail route blazed from the coastal towns of Seward and Knik to the goldfields and mining camps of northwestern Alaska in the early 1900s. Sled teams delivered mail and supplies to such towns as Nome and Iditarod and carried out gold. The trail declined in use in the 1920s, when the airplane began to replace the dogsled as the primary means of crossing the difficult terrain. But when no capable pilot was available during Alaska’s diphtheria epidemic of 1925, a team of mushers battled blizzard conditions and rushed serum to icebound Nome. This heroic action, called the “Great Race of Mercy,” brought renewed international fame to the trail and the dog teams, particularly to Balto, the lead dog of the team that finally reached Nome. In memory of the serum run’s principal musher, Leonhard Seppala, the Iditarod was originally called the Iditarod Trail Seppala Memorial Race. Today’s race commemorates both the serum run and Alaska’s frontier past, and it is patterned after the famed All Alaska Sweepstakes Race between Nome and Candle that began in 1908.
