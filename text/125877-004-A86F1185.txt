Gambia River, river in western Africa, 700 miles (1,120 km) long, rising in the Republic of Guinea and flowing westward through The Gambia into the Atlantic Ocean. Its major tributaries are the Sandougou and the Sofianiama. The Gambia is one of the finest waterways in Africa and the only western African river that is easily accessible to oceangoing shipping. It constitutes a unifying factor for the independent state of The Gambia, which consists of a narrow strip of land along both banks of the river. The political separation between The Gambia and Senegal has, however, long hindered the development of the resources of the river and its basin, though in 1978 the two countries established the Gambia River Development Organization (joined in 1980 by Guinea).
From its source in the highlands of the Fouta Djallon, the Gambia follows a winding course to its mouth, which is a ria, or drowned estuary. The dividing and reuniting of river channels—a phenomenon known as braiding—has created several islands along the river’s middle course, of which the two largest are Elephant Island and MacCarthy Island. The river is joined by numerous creeks called bolons, the largest of these being Bintang Bolon, which flows into it from the south. The width of the river’s valley varies considerably along its course. The river valley is cut into a plateau of sandstone dating from Paleogene and Neogene times (i.e., about 65 to 2.6 million years ago).
