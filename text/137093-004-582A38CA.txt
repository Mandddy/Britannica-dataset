David Robinson, in full David Maurice Robinson, byname the Admiral  (born Aug. 6, 1965, Key West, Fla., U.S.) American basketball player who won two National Basketball Association (NBA) titles with the San Antonio Spurs (1999, 2003).
Robinson played basketball at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Md., leading the academy team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament in 1985, 1986, and 1987. Although Robinson proved himself one of the best collegiate players in the country, some observers considered it a gamble when the Spurs chose him with the first pick of the 1987 NBA draft, since he had to serve two years of active duty in the U.S. Navy after graduationâ€”time when he would not play for the Spurs or play regularly against top-flight competition.
