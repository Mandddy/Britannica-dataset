Dermestid beetle (family Dermestidae), any of approximately 700 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) that at one time were important household pests because the larvae feed on furs, skins, feathers, horn, and hair. Adults are usually brown or black, although some are brightly coloured or patterned and are covered with either hairs or scales that easily rub off. They vary in shape from elongated to oval, and range in size from 1 to 12 mm (up to 1/2 inch). The wormlike larvae are the only beetle larvae that are covered with hair.
The larder beetle larva (Dermestes lardarius) feeds on cheese and dried meats, especially ham and bacon. The adult beetle is oval, black or brown with yellowish bands and dark spots, and 6 to 7.5 mm (0.236 to 0.295 in) long. The beetles are usually discovered inside a house when the adult emerges from its pupal stage and is seen around windows trying to get outside to feed on pollen.
