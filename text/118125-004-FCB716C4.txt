Voyageurs National Park, region of lakes and wilderness in northern Minnesota, U.S. The park lies along the Canadian border, east of International Falls. Authorized in 1971 and established in 1975, it was named for the mostly French Canadian frontiersmen called voyageurs (French: “travelers”), who were involved in fur trading in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The voyageurs used large birch bark canoes to carry beaver pelts and trade goods between the Canadian Northwest and Montreal. The park occupies an area of 341 square miles (883 square km).
The park consists of a network of lakes—the largest of which are Rainy (partly in the park), Namakan, and Kabetogama—and connecting streams in the heart of the North Woods. The Kabetogama Peninsula is the central focus of the park and is almost completely surrounded by the three large lakes. Stands of fir, spruce, pine, aspen, and birch are found throughout the park. Wildlife includes deer, moose, beavers, wolves, coyotes, and many varieties of native waterfowl and other birds. Access to the park is chiefly by boat in the summer and snowmobile and skis in the winter; there are no permanent roads on the Kabetogama Peninsula, but a road on the ice of Rainy Lake allows motor vehicles to travel 7 miles (11 km) along the northern edge of the peninsula in the winter.
