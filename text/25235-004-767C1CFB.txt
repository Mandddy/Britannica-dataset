Sophus Otto Müller,  (born May 24, 1846, Copenhagen, Den.—died  Feb. 23, 1934, Copenhagen) Danish archaeologist who, during the late 19th century, discovered the first of the Neolithic battle-ax cultures in Denmark.
Assistant (1878) and inspector (1885) at the Museum of National Antiquities, Copenhagen, Müller became codirector of the Danish prehistoric and ethnographic collections at the National Museum, Copenhagen, when it was established in 1892. His discovery in central Jutland of single burial graves enclosed within barrows (burial mounds) was the first evidence of the later Middle Neolithic Periods in Scandinavia. Excavations uncovered chronological sequences of graves containing well-proportioned battle-axes, flint axes, amber beads, beakers, and cups.
