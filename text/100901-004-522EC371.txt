Count Kuroda Kiyotaka,  (born Nov. 21, 1840, Satsuma province, Japan—died  Aug. 25, 1900, Tokyo) Japanese statesman who played a leading role in the Meiji Restoration, the 1868 overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate and reestablishment of imperial rule in Japan. He served as prime minister from April 1888 to October 1889. Kuroda was one of the original genro, the handful of statesmen from Satsuma and Chōshū, who officially and unofficially dominated the Japanese government from 1868 until the end of World War I.
Having commanded the imperial forces that captured the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido for the Meiji government, Kuroda in 1870 was put in charge of colonizing and developing that relatively primitive area. He hired American agricultural experts, subsidized immigrants, and encouraged new industry. Within a decade the population of the island quadrupled, and the productivity markedly increased. As a result, Hokkaido became a secure part of the Japanese islands, safe from the threat of Russian penetration.
