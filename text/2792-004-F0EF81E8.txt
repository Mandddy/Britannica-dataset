Moscow 1980 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Moscow that took place July 19–August 3, 1980. The Moscow Games were the 19th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
The Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979 led to the largest boycott in the history of the Olympic movement. U.S. Pres. Jimmy Carter took the lead in the call for a boycott of the 1980 Olympics, and approximately 60 other countries joined the United States in staying away from Moscow. A number of Western countries did not observe the boycott, notably Great Britain, France, Italy, and Sweden. In all, about 5,000 athletes representing 81 countries did attend the Games. Protests against the Soviet presence in Afghanistan continued, however. Several of the participating countries refused to attend the opening ceremony, and the Olympic hymn was played at several medal ceremonies, rather than the appropriate national anthem. The Games were also hurt by rowdy behaviour from spectators, cheating by officials, and security so intrusive that winners in track events were physically prevented from taking victory laps.
