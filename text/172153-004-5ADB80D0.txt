Hugh Peter, Peter also spelled Peters  (born 1598, Fowey, Cornwall, England—died October 16, 1660, London) English Independent minister, army preacher, and propagandist during the Civil War and Commonwealth.
Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was ordained a priest in the Anglican Church in 1623. He went to London in 1626 and was appointed preacher at St. Sepulchre’s, but his unorthodox views led to the suspension of his preaching license in 1627. He was in Holland from 1628 to 1635. He returned to England and then sailed to Massachusetts, where he succeeded Roger Williams as preacher at Salem in December 1636. He played a leading part in the colony’s affairs and helped in the founding of Connecticut. Peter returned to England in 1641 as an agent for Massachusetts, but after the Irish Insurrection (October 1641) he went to Ireland as chaplain to a company of adventurers under Alexander, Lord Forbes, which fought against the Irish rebels (June–September 1642). As chaplain to the New Model Army, Peter preached during the campaigns of 1645 and 1646.
