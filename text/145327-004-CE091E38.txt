Linnaeite,  a cobalt sulfide mineral (Co3S4) or any member of a series of similar substances with the general formula (Co,Ni)2(Co, Ni, Fe, Cu)S4. The other known members of the series are siegenite, (Co,Ni)3S4 with Co:Ni = 1:1; carrollite, Co2CuS4; violarite, Ni2FeS4; and polydymite, Ni3S4. The linnaeites are usually associated with other metal sulfides in hydrothermal veins. A typical occurrence is the Siegen district, Germany. The members of this series crystallize in the isometric system; they all have spinellike structures. For chemical formulas and detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
