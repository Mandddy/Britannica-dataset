Inherit the Wind, American film drama, released in 1960, that was inspired by the famous Scopes Trial of 1925, in which a Tennessee high-school teacher was arrested and prosecuted for teaching Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of evolution.
Although the film was based on real events, the names of all the participants were changed. Spencer Tracy and Fredric March portrayed characters based on Clarence Darrow (the defense attorney) and William Jennings Bryan (the prosecutor), respectively. The men square off in famous courtroom battles at the heart of an important chapter in American history. Gene Kelly was cast as a cynical reporter who was modeled after H.L. Mencken.
