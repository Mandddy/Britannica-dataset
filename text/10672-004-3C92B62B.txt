George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys,  (born May 15, 1645?, Acton, Denbighshire, Wales—died April 18, 1689, London) English judge notorious for his cruelty and corruption. He presided over the “Bloody Assizes” of 1685 following the failure of the duke of Monmouth’s rebellion and was in charge of executing the unpopular religious policy of the Roman Catholic king James II.
Born into the Welsh gentry, Jeffreys was admitted to the bar in 1668, and in 1677 he obtained an appointment as solicitor general to Charles II’s Roman Catholic brother James, duke of York (later James II). During the panic that followed Titus Oates’s fabricated revelations (1678) of a popish plot against the government, Jeffreys served as a prosecuting counsel or judge in many of the trials of suspected Catholic conspirators. He earned notoriety by savagely ridiculing and bullying the defendants.
