Battle of Santiago, (Juneâ€“July 1898), concluding engagement fought near Santiago de Cuba in the Spanish-American War, in which U.S. successes on land and sea resulted in final victory over the Spaniards.
On May 19, 1898, a month after the outbreak of hostilities between the two powers, a Spanish fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera arrived in Santiago harbour on the southern coast of Cuba. U.S. naval squadrons in the Atlantic, under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson and Commodore Winfield S. Schley, thereupon blockaded the harbour entrance.
