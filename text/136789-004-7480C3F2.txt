John McPhee, in full John Angus McPhee  (born March 8, 1931, Princeton, N.J., U.S.) American journalist whose nonfiction books are accessible and informative on a wide variety of topics—particularly profiles of figures in sports, science, and the environment. Many of his books are adaptations of articles he published in The New Yorker magazine.
After graduating from Princeton University (A.B., 1953), McPhee studied for a year at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He served as an associate editor at Time magazine (1957–64) and a staff writer at The New Yorker (from 1965). His first book, A Sense of Where You Are (1965), is based on an article he wrote for The New Yorker on Bill Bradley, basketball player and Rhodes scholar (and from 1978 to 1996, U.S. senator). Subjects of McPhee’s subsequent profiles include a preparatory school administrator in The Headmaster (1966); tennis players in Levels of the Game (1969) and Arthur Ashe Remembered (1993); a conservationist in Encounters with the Archdruid (1971); a boat craftsman in The Survival of the Bark Canoe (1975); and a merchant marine in Looking for a Ship (1990).
