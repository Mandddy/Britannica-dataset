Narmada River, also called Narbada or Nerbudda,  river in central India that has always been an important route between the Arabian Sea and the Ganges (Ganga) River valley. The river was called Namade by the 2nd-century-ce Greek geographer Ptolemy.
The Narmada rises at an elevation of about 3,500 feet (1,080 metres) in the Maikala Range in eastern Madhya Pradesh state on the border with Chhattisgarh state. It first follows a tortuous course through the hills near Mandla and then turns northwest to pass the city of Jabalpur. There it turns southwest and then enters the structural trough between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges at Marble Rocks Gorge. Turning more westward, the river continues across Madhya Pradesh until it passes into Gujarat state. The Narmada enters the Gulf of Khambhat through an estuary 13 miles (21 km) wide, just below Bharuch.
