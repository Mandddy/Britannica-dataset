Paul Dukas,  (born Oct. 1, 1865, Paris, Fr.—died  May 17, 1935, Paris) French composer whose fame rests on a single orchestral work, the dazzling, ingenious L’Apprenti sorcier (1897; The Sorcerer’s Apprentice).
Dukas studied at the Paris Conservatory and, after winning a second Grand Prix de Rome with his cantata Velléda (1888), established his position among the younger French composers with the overture, first performed in 1892, to Pierre Corneille’s Polyeucte and with the Symphony in C Major (1896). The rest of his output (never large, owing to his own strict censorship of his works) was mainly dramatic and program music and compositions for piano. Dukas, a master of orchestration, was from 1910 to 1912 professor of the orchestral class at the Paris Conservatory, and from 1927 until his death he was professor of composition there. He also contributed musical criticism to several Paris papers, and his collected writings, Les Écrits de Paul Dukas sur la musique (1948), include some of the best essays ever published on Jean-Philippe Rameau, Christoph Gluck, and Hector Berlioz.
