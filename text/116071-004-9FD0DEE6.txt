Warwickshire, administrative and historic county of central England, in the Midlands region. As an administrative and geographic unit, the county dates from the 10th century, with the historic county town (seat) of Warwick lying roughly at its centre.
Covering a smaller and somewhat different area than the historic county, the present administrative county of Warwickshire comprises a largely rural landscape of woodlands, fields, and pastures, with only a few large towns. It includes five districts: Stratford-on-Avon, Warwick, and the boroughs of North Warwickshire, Nuneaton and Bedworth, and Rugby. The administrative county lies mostly within the historic county, but it includes three areas in Stratford-on-Avon district that belong to other historic counties. The parish of Oldberrow and an area along the River Stour extending from north of Alderminster to south of Shipston-on-Stour lie within the historic county of Worcestershire. An area south of the River Avon (Upper, or Warwickshire, Avon) and west of the Stour, including Welford and Upper Quinton, belongs to the historic county of Gloucestershire.
