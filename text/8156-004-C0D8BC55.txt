Bearded collie, dog breed developed in Great Britain for herding sheep and driving cattle to market; it is one the oldest British breeds, and its ancestors may have included herding dogs from the Continent. The bearded collie is a medium-sized dog covered with a long, shaggy coat covering even the hanging ears, tail, legs, and muzzle (hence, bearded); its long eyebrows blend into the coat on the head. Consequently, it requires regular attention to keep the coat in good condition. It stands 20 to 22 inches (51 to 56 cm) and occurs in light or dark shades of several coat colours, including black, blue, fawn, or brown, frequently with large areas of white on the legs and feet, belly, chest, neck, and face, and the tip of the tail. It is esteemed as a cheerful, loyal, alert, playful family pet and companion as well as a working dog.
