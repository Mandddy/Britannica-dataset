Randolph Caldecott,  (born March 22, 1846, Chester, Cheshire, Eng.â€”died  Feb. 12, 1886, St. Augustine, Fla., U.S.) English artist chiefly known for the gently satirical drawings and coloured book illustrations that won him great popularity.
While a bank clerk at Whitchurch, Shropshire, and at Manchester, Caldecott began drawing for local magazines. Through his acquaintance with George Du Maurier he began contributing to the periodical London Society in 1871; the next year he settled in London and turned professional, ultimately drawing for Punch and Graphic, among other periodicals. He increased his skill by painting under Sir Edward Poynter and by sketching and modelling in the studio of J. Dalou.
