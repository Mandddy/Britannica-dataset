Cixi, Wade-Giles romanization Tz’u-hsi, also called Xitaihou, or Xiaoqin Xianhuanghou, byname Empress Dowager  (born November 29, 1835, Beijing, China—died November 15, 1908, Beijing) consort of the Xianfeng emperor (reigned 1850–61), mother of the Tongzhi emperor (reigned 1861–75), adoptive mother of the Guangxu emperor (reigned 1875–1908), and a towering presence over the Chinese empire for almost half a century. Ruling through a clique of conservative, corrupt officials and maintaining authority over the Manchu imperial house (Qing dynasty, 1644–1911/12), she became one of the most powerful women in the history of China.
Cixi was one of the Xianfeng emperor’s low-ranking concubines, but in 1856 she bore his only son. On Xianfeng’s death, the six-year-old boy became the Tongzhi emperor, and state business was put in the hands of a regency council of eight elder officials. A few months later, after Gong Qinwang (Prince Gong), the former emperor’s brother, was victorious in a palace coup, the regency was transferred to Cixi and Xianfeng’s former senior consort, Ci’an. Gong became the prince counsellor.
