Roger Ailes, in full Roger Eugene Ailes  (born May 15, 1940, Warren, Ohio, U.S.) American television producer and political consultant who became the founding president of Fox News Channel (1996–16).
Ailes, the son of a foreman at a Packard Electric plant, grew up in an Ohio factory town. He began a career in television the year that he graduated from Ohio University (B.A., 1962), serving as a property assistant for the Cleveland-based program The Mike Douglas Show. By 1965 he was working as a producer for the show, and in 1967–68 he served as executive producer, receiving an Emmy Award for his work both years. It was during his tenure as executive producer that he met Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon, who appeared as a guest on the show. Ailes subsequently left The Mike Douglas Show to serve as a media adviser for Nixon’s presidential campaign. Aided by Ailes’s television expertise, Nixon won the presidency in 1968.
