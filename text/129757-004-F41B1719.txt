Herschel, European Space Agency space telescope, launched on May 14, 2009, that studied infrared radiation from astronomical objects. It was named in honour of German-born British astronomer Sir William Herschel, who discovered infrared radiation in 1800. Herschel was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket that also carried Planck, a satellite that studied the cosmic microwave background.
Herschel was the largest telescope launched into space. Its primary mirror was 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) across. Herschel had three instruments: a high-resolution spectrometer that operated in two bands to observe light with wavelengths from 157 to 212 micrometres and from 240 to 625 micrometres (1 micrometre = 10âˆ’6 metre), a combined camera/spectrometer that saw infrared radiation between 55 to 210 micrometres, and another combined camera/spectrometer that observed three wavelength bands at 250, 350, and 500 micrometres. The instruments were shielded by a hatch until June 14, 2009, when the pyrotechnic bolts holding it in place were manually triggered from the ground; the hatch had remained in place for a month in order to ensure that contaminants such as water vapour had evaporated. Removal of the hatch allowed the telescope to begin functioning upon reaching its orbit. Galaxies forming in the early universe, the interstellar medium in other galaxies, and nascent planetary systems were some of the objects that Herschel was particularly well suited to study.
