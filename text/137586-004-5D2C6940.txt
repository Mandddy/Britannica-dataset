Keteleeria, genus in the family Pinaceae, containing three to seven species of coniferous evergreen trees, native to Southeast Asia. The trees resemble true firs (members of the genus Abies) but have clusters of 5 to 10 male reproductive structures on short, scaly stalks; spine-tipped leaves on young plants; buds with many overlapping scales that form a sheath around the shoot base; and cones whose scales do not fall at maturity.
