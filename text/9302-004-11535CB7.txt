Spiny eel,  any of two groups of fishes, those of the freshwater family Mastacembelidae (order Perciformes) and of the deep-sea family Notacanthidae (order Notacanthiformes). Members of both groups are elongated and eel-like but are not related to true eels.
The freshwater spiny eels comprise about 73 species found in the tropics from Africa to China. Carnivorous, they are usually nocturnal, burrowing into the bottom by day. They have a long, movable snout and a row of spines preceding the soft portion of the dorsal fin. There are no pelvic fins, and the soft dorsal, anal, and tail fins are usually joined. The largest is about 90 cm (3 feet) long, but most are much smaller. Depending on the authority, these fishes may be placed in the suborder Mastacembeloidei or in a distinct order, Mastacembeliformes.
