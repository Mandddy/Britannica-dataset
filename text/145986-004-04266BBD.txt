Donato Bramante, Donato also spelled Donino or Donnino  (born c. 1444, probably at Monte Asdrualdo, Duchy of Urbino [Italy]—died April 11, 1514, Rome) architect who introduced the High Renaissance style in architecture. His early works in Milan included the rectory of Sant’Ambrogio and the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In Rome, Bramante served as principal planner of Pope Julius II’s comprehensive project for rebuilding the city. St. Peter’s Basilica, of which he was the chief architect, was begun in 1506. Other major Roman works were the Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio (1502) and the Belvedere court in the Vatican (begun c. 1505).
Donato Bramante was born of a family of well-to-do farmers. In his childhood, says the 16th-century biographer and artist Giorgio Vasari, “besides reading and writing, he practiced much at the abacus.” His father probably directed him toward painting.
