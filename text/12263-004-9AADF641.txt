Donald Douglas, in full Donald Wills Douglas  (born April 6, 1892, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died February 1, 1981, Palm Springs, California) American aircraft designer who founded the Douglas Aircraft Company.
Douglas assisted Jerome C. Hunsaker in building the first wind tunnel, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge (1914–15), and was chief engineer for the Glenn L. Martin Company before organizing his own firm in 1920. His early government contracts included an order for the Douglas World Cruiser biplanes. Two of the four planes that set out on the first around-the-world flight, on April 6, 1924, completed the trip on September 28. The prototype DC-1 commercial transport (flown July 1933) and the production model DC-2 were succeeded (1935) by the larger and more powerful DC-3 (military designation C-47 [Dakota]). The four-engined DC-4 (military versions, Air Force C-54 and Navy R5D-1) and the DC-6 and DC-7 series were commercially successful.
