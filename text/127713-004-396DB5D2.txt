Samuel Lover,  (born Feb. 24, 1797, Dublin, Ire.—died  July 6, 1868, St. Helier, Isle of Jersey) Anglo-Irish novelist, songwriter, and painter. Privately educated, Lover fled his father’s stockbroking office and became a successful painter, largely of portraits. He also wrote songs, notably “Rory O’More” (1826), which he also developed as a novel (1837) and a play (1837). His best known novel is Handy Andy (1842), often seen as one of the sources of the “stage Irishman,” a popular theatrical stereotype. After failing eyesight forced him to give up painting, he gave successful entertainments using his own writings in both Great Britain and North America.
