Mikhail Vasilyevich Matyushin ,  (born 1861, Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire—died October 14, 1934, Leningrad, Russia, U.S.S.R. [now St. Petersburg, Russia]) Russian painter, composer, and theoretician who was a leading member of the Russian avant-garde.
Matyushin attended the Moscow Conservatory from 1878 to 1881 and was already a professional musician—first violinist of the St. Petersburg Court Orchestra (1881–1913)—when he began painting. He initially worked as a self-taught artist and completed art studies at the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in 1898. After this training, he enrolled at the studio of Yan Tsionglinsky (1898–1906), where he met Yelena Guro (his future [second] wife), and studied for two semesters (1906–08) at the private studio of Yelizaveta Zvantseva with Léon Bakst and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky.
