Cloud, any visible mass of water droplets, ice crystals, or a mixture of both that is suspended in the air, usually at a considerable height (see video). Fog is a shallow layer of cloud at or near ground level.
Clouds are formed when relatively moist air rises. As a mass of air ascends, the lower pressures prevailing at higher levels allow it to expand. In expanding, the air cools adiabatically (i.e., without heat exchange with the surrounding air) until its temperature falls below the dew point, upon which the air becomes supersaturated such that water vapour condenses onto cloud condensation nuclei or tiny water droplets (or deposits onto ice nuclei or tiny ice crystals). Condensation nuclei are composed of microscopic particles in the air. This process rapidly gives rise to droplets on the order of 0.01 mm (0.0004 inch) in diameter. These droplets, usually present in concentrations of a few hundred per cubic centimetre, constitute a nonprecipitating water cloud. Clouds consist entirely of water droplets, entirely of ice crystals, or of a mixture of water droplets and ice crystals, with crystals predominating in the colder, upper regions of the troposphere. Mixed clouds occur only when the cloud temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F). In such clouds the ice crystals will grow preferentially with respect to the water droplets as water vapour evaporates from the droplets and deposits onto the ice crystals. Thus, mixed clouds last for only short times before becoming all ice crystals.
