Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft,  (born March 16, 1581, Amsterdam, Netherlands—died May 21, 1647, The Hague) Dutch dramatist and poet, regarded by many as the most brilliant representative of Dutch Renaissance literature. Hooft’s prose style continued to provide a model into the 19th century.
During three years spent in France and Italy, Hooft came completely under the spell of the new learning and art; the impact of that experience is shown by the contrast between his letter in pre-Renaissance verse sent from Florence to his friends in Amsterdam and the first poetry he wrote after his return: love lyrics and the pastoral play Grandida (1605). That play is noted for the delicacy of its poetry and the simplicity of its moral—that individuals and nations can be at peace only when rulers and subjects alike shun ambition and seek only to serve.
