Gustavo Dudamel,  (born January 26, 1981, Barquisimeto, Venezuela) Venezuelan conductor and music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (2009– ) who earned acclaim for his ability to draw fresh, dynamic performances from orchestras.
By the age of five, Dudamel had begun studies with the National System of Youth and Children’s Orchestras of Venezuela (popularly known as El Sistema), the country’s acclaimed training program in music. He first took up the violin and then studied composition and conducting. In 1999 José Antonio Abreu, who had founded El Sistema in the 1970s, gave Dudamel additional instruction in conducting and appointed him music director of the Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela (SBYOV; later renamed the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela), the chief performing group. The next year Dudamel and the orchestra toured Germany, and in following years they made additional trips to Europe, all to ecstatic reviews. They played their first concerts in the United States in 2007 and in Japan in 2008.
