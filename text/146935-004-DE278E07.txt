Luwian language, also called Luvian or Luish,  one of several ancient extinct Anatolian languages. The language is preserved in two closely related but distinct forms, one using cuneiform script and the other using hieroglyphic writing.
Luwian influence on the vocabulary of the Hittite language began before the earliest surviving texts, but it greatly increased in the Hittite New Empire period (1400–1190 bce), leading to minor effects even on nominal (noun) and verb inflection. The archives at the empire’s capital city of Hattusa (near the modern town of Boğazkale, formerly Boğazköy, Turkey) include examples where Cuneiform Luwian incantations were inserted into Hittite rituals. There are also many Luwianisms scattered throughout the Hittite cuneiform texts, both as foreign words and as genuine loanwords adopted into the Hittite language.
