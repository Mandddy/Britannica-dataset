William Holabird,  (born September 11, 1854, Amenia Union, New York, U.S.—died July 19, 1923, Evanston, Illinois) American architect who, with his partner, Martin Roche, was a leading exponent of the influential Chicago School of commercial architecture; their Tacoma Building (Chicago, 1886–89) established the use of a total steel skeleton as a framework for building skyscrapers—a significant advance over the pioneering use of metal supports in the Home Insurance Building by William Le Baron Jenney (Chicago, 1884–85).
Holabird attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, but after two years he resigned (1875) and moved to Chicago. He worked as draftsman for Jenney, then for the eminent firm of Burnham and Root. He established his own practice in 1880 with Ossian C. Simonds, who subsequently left for a career in landscape architecture. Roche joined the firm in 1881. Holabird and Roche were responsible for many innovations identified with the Chicago School, such as the so-called Chicago School windows, which resulted in a facade almost entirely made of glass, as in their Marquette Building (1894, Chicago). Their Gage Building (1898, Chicago), with a facade by the brilliant architect Louis Sullivan, was cited as a Chicago architectural landmark in 1962. Although their buildings lack the virtuosity of Sullivan’s or Root’s, Holabird and Roche were unequalled in their perseverance in perpetuating the Chicago School. Long after others gave up the Chicago style in favour of historic styles or the newer Prairie School architecture, Holabird and Roche continued to produce their tall commercial buildings in the Chicago style until their deaths. The Republic Building (Chicago, begun 1905), one of their best 20th-century buildings, was demolished in 1961.
