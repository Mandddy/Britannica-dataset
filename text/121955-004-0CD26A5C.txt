Mato Grosso, inland estado (state) of central Brazil. It is bounded on the northwest by the states of Rondônia and Amazonas, on the northeast by Pará, on the east by Tocantins and Goiás, on the south by Mato Grosso do Sul, and on the southwest and west by Bolivia. Mato Grosso, whose name means “great woods,” is one of the remaining great frontier regions of the world. The state capital is Cuiabá.
Mato Grosso was settled first by pioneering gold seekers from São Paulo after they had been forced to retreat by the emboabas (Portuguese colonists) of Minas Gerais in the so-called war of the emboabas in 1708, over mining rights in gold fields. With the founding in 1719 of Cuiabá, where rich placer mines had been found, Mato Grosso became a district of the captaincy of São Paulo, and in 1748 it became an independent captaincy. In 1761 the capital was transferred to Vila Bela, on the Guaporé River, but in 1820 it was returned to Cuiabá. During the colonial period and until deposits were largely exhausted, the region’s placer mines supplied substantial quantities of gold and some diamonds. After the decline of mining, cattle ranching emerged as the principal activity. Mato Grosso became a province of the empire in 1822 and a state of the federal union in 1889.
