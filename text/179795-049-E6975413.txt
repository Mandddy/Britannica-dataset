Gir National Park, national park in Gujarat state, west-central India, located about 37 miles (60 km) south-southwest of Junagadh in a hilly region of dry scrubland. It has an area of about 500 square miles (1,295 square km). Vegetation consists of teak with an admixture of deciduous trees, including sal (Shorea robusta), dhak (Butea frondosa), and thorn forests.
The Gir Forests Reserve, created in 1913 to protect the largest of the surviving groups of Asiatic lions, was accorded sanctuary status in 1965. Several hundred Asiatic lions have been bred in the sanctuary since it was established. “Lion shows” consisting of guided tours in protected vehicles are held regularly for visitors. Other fauna include leopards, wild pigs, spotted deer, nilgai (a type of antelope), four-horned antelope, and chinkaras (a type of gazelle). A large central water hole contains a few crocodiles. The park also has a small temple dedicated to Krishna near the Tulsi-Shyam Springs.
