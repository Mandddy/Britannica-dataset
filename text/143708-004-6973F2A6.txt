Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, also called Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove, Pinyin romanization Zhulinqixian, Wade-Giles romanization Chu-lin ch’i-hsien ,  a group of Chinese scholars and poets of the mid-3rd century ad who banded together to escape from the hypocrisy and danger of the political world of government officialdom to a life of drinking wine and writing verse in the country. Their retreat was typical of the Daoist-oriented qingtan (“pure conversation”) movement that advocated freedom of individual expression and hedonistic escape from the corrupt court politics of the short-lived Wei dynasty (ad 220–265/266; Three Kingdoms period).
The group of friends gathered in a bamboo grove near the country estate of the writer and alchemist Ji Kang in Shanyang (in the south of present-day Henan province). Ji’s independent thinking and scorn for court custom led to his execution by the state, which was strongly protested by his several thousand followers; his execution testifies to the very real dangers that forced the Sages’ retirement from palace life.
