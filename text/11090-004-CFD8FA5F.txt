Herāt, also spelled Harāt,  city in western Afghanistan, lying on the Harīrūd River, south of the Sefīd Kūh (Paropamisus Range), at an elevation of 3,026 feet (922 metres). Herāt is the focus of one of the country’s most densely populated and fertile agricultural areas, irrigated from the Harīrūd. It is a highway crossroads and the economic centre of western Afghanistan.
Several ancient cities have stood near the site of Herāt. The highly productive agricultural area watered by the Harīrūd was known in ancient times as Ariea (Old Persian: Haraiva). The area is mentioned in the Avesta, the sacred text of the Zoroastrians, and appears in the Achaemenid inscription at Bīsitūn (c. 520 bce). The Macedonian conquerer Alexander the Great took control of the area in 330 bce. The capital of Ariea, Artacoana, was subdued, and a new city named Alexandria in Ariea was constructed with a fortress at the city centre. It remains uncertain whether Alexandria in Ariea was built on the site of Artacoana and whether the site of modern Herāt corresponds to either.
