Keck Observatory, in full W.M. Keck Observatory,  astronomical observatory located near the 4,200-metre (13,800-foot) summit of Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on north-central Hawaii Island, Hawaii, U.S. Keckâ€™s twin 10-metre (394-inch) telescopes, housed in separate domes, constitute the largest optical telescope system of the burgeoning multi-observatory science reserve located on Mauna Kea.
Construction of the Keck Observatory was funded primarily by the W.M. Keck Foundation, a philanthropic organization established by William Myron Keck, founder of Superior Oil Company. The first Keck telescope, Keck I, was completed in 1992 and the second, Keck II, in 1996. The observatory is operated as a consortium led by the California Institute of Technology and the University of California, which created the California Association for Research in Astronomy to maintain and operate the facility. Since 1996 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has participated as a full partner. With the University of Hawaii, which manages the Mauna Kea reserve, they share the use of the facility.
