Glacier National Park,  park in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, lying in the heart of the Selkirk Mountains, within the great northern bend of the Columbia River, east of Revelstoke. Established in 1886, it occupies an area of 521 square miles (1,349 square km). Majestic snowcapped peaks, such as Hermit, Cheops, Grizzly, Sifton, Grant, Avalanche, and Sir Donald, flanked by immense ice fields and glaciers, form an impressive alpine panorama, with canyons, turbulent rivers, waterfalls, and flower-filled meadows. Outstanding features are the Illecillewaet Glacier, which has an area of 10 square miles (26 square km) and falls more than 3,500 feet (1,100 m) from its névé (partially compacted snow at its upper end), and the Nakimu Caves in the Cougar Valley. The park is crossed by the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Trans-Canada Highway.
