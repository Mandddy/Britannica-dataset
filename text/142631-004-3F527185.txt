Orangery,  garden building designed for the wintering of exotic shrubs and trees, primarily orange trees. The earliest orangeries were practical buildings that could be completely covered by planks and sacking and heated in the cold season by stoves; such buildings existed in Great Britain and France as early as the second half of the 16th century.
The great period of the orangery, when few great gardens were without one, extended from the latter half of the 17th century into the early 18th century. Great numbers of orange trees were fruited in what became the most elaborate architectural feature of princely gardens. Many famous orangeries survive, notably those at the gardens of Versailles in France and Kew House, Greater London.
