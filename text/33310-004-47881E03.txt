Dresden Codex, Latin Codex Dresdensis ,  one of the few collections of pre-Columbian Mayan hieroglyphic texts known to have survived the book burnings by the Spanish clergy during the 16th century (others include the Madrid, Paris, and Grolier codices). It contains astronomical calculations—eclipse-prediction tables, the synodical period of Venus—of exceptional accuracy. These figures have given the Maya a strong reputation as astronomers. The codex was acquired by the Saxon State Library, Dresden, Saxony, and was published by Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough, in Antiquities of Mexico (1830–48). King erroneously attributed the codex to the Aztecs. The first scientific edition of the codex was made by E. Förstemann (Leipzig, 1880). See also Madrid Codex; Paris Codex.
