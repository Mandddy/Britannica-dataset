EHarmony, American company providing online personal-relationship and matchmaking services. Founded in 2000 by Neil Clark Warren, a clinical psychologist, eHarmony is based in Pasadena, Calif. The company aims to unite compatible individuals in long-term relationships via scientific methods.
After signing up with the service, a user completes a lengthy survey designed to evaluate his or her emotional health, values, beliefs, characteristics, and skills. From the survey, a personality profile of the user is created, as well as a compatibility profile, which describes the type of person for whom the user is ideally suited. Once the survey and profiles have been completed, eHarmony attempts to match the applicant with a suitable partner by using a patented matching system. This system was developed by the company after researching 5,000 married couples and identifying the factors that make marriages succeed or fail. Once a list of partners is produced, eHarmony assists the user in narrowing the list and making initial contact.
