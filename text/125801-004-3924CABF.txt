Team roping,  timed rodeo event in which two mounted contestants attempt to rope and immobilize a full-grown steer. The ropers wait on both sides of the steer’s chute. The first roper (header) begins behind a rope barrier to give the steer a head start. If the header leaves too soon (“breaks the barrier”), a 10-second penalty is assessed. The header chases after the steer and ropes either both horns, the head and one horn, or the neck. The header “dallies” his rope (wraps it around the saddle horn one or more times) and rides to the left, towing the steer behind his horse while the heeler ropes both hind legs. If one of the steer’s feet comes free, there is a five-second penalty. Time stops when both riders face each other with tight ropes. The steer may remain upright or rolled onto its side. The fastest time wins. Team ropers acquire their championship points (header and heeler points) separately, as they often rope with different partners. The event has its practical origin as the method used by ranchers to immobilize cows for medical treatment.
