Atsina, also called Gros Ventres of the Prairie, self-name A’aninin ,  North American Indian tribe related to the Algonquian-speaking Arapaho, from which they may have separated as early as 1700. The variant name Gros Ventres (French: “Big Bellies”) was a misinterpretation by French trappers of Plains Indian sign language. The Blackfoot called the Atsina the “Belly People,” and the sign for that name was similar to one referring to the chest tattooing practiced by a neighbouring subgroup of unrelated Hidatsa, also known as the Gros Ventres de la Riviere (“of the River”). The Atsina were thereafter distinguished from the Hidatsa with the addition of “des Plaines” (“of the Prairie”) to their misnomer. Their self-name means “White Clay People.”
The Atsina were living in what is now northern Montana and adjacent regions of Canada in late prehistoric times and were culturally similar to other Plains Indians. They spoke an Algonquian language unusual in having different pronunciations for men and women. The Atsina were mentioned in the journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–06). In the late 1800s they were relocated to Fort Belknap Reservation in northern Montana, which they shared with the Assiniboin. Atsina descendants numbered more than 6,000 in the early 21st century.
