Jonas Brothers, American soft-rock band noted for its combination of optimism, catchy tunes, and cover-boy good looks. The members were Paul Kevin Jonas II (b. November 5, 1987, Teaneck, New Jersey, U.S.), Joseph Adam Jonas (b. August 15, 1989, Casa Grande, Arizona), and Nicholas Jerry Jonas (b. September 16, 1992, Dallas, Texas).
The three brothers were raised in a musical family and imbued with a strong sense of Christian values, notably by their father, an Assembly of God minister. Family sing-alongs in their New Jersey home set the stage for Nick’s precocious performances on Broadway beginning at the age of six. In 2004 he released a Christian-themed solo album. The pleasure of making music together prompted the brothers to form a band, with Kevin and Nick on guitar (with keyboard work mixed in) while Nick and Joe shared the lead vocal chores. Their first album, It’s About Time (2006), featured songs cowritten by Desmond Child and pop star Adam Schlesinger of the band Fountains of Wayne. Although it was given only a limited marketing push, the album sold 62,000 copies; still, the label dropped the band.
