Jacques-Paul Migne,  (born Oct. 25, 1800, Saint-Flour, France—died  Oct. 24, 1875, Paris) French Roman Catholic priest who became one of the foremost 19th-century publishers of theological literature.
Migne studied theology at Orléans, France, where he was ordained priest in 1824. He was then assigned to the French parish of Puiseaux. In 1833 he went to Paris and started a newspaper, L’Univers Religieux (“The Religious World”). At Petit-Montrouge, near Paris, he opened (1836) a publishing house that produced vast collections of religious works at popular prices. The original establishment was destroyed by fire in 1868, but Migne subsequently founded a new house in Paris.
