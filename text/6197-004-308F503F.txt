Francis Maitland Balfour,  (born Nov. 10, 1851, Edinburgh—died  July 19, 1882, near Martigny-Ville, Switz.) British zoologist, younger brother of the statesman Arthur James Balfour, and a founder of modern embryology.
His interest in the subject was aroused by the lectures of the British physiologist Michael Foster, and, after graduation from Cambridge in 1873, Balfour obtained one of the university’s chairs at the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, an international centre for marine biological research. During the next five years, he made many original observations about the embryonic development of vertebrate urogenital organs (e.g., kidneys, sex organs) and the origin of spinal nerves. These discoveries, along with his descriptions of the initial changes in the ovum after fertilization and of the early stages of the embryo, provided crucial information on the evolution of invertebrates to vertebrates.
