Taos, county, a scenic region in northern New Mexico, U.S., bordered on the north by Colorado. It lies in the Southern Rocky Mountains. The Sangre de Cristo range in the eastern portion of the county features high, aspen-covered mountainsides; much of it is more than 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) above sea level, culminating in Mount Wheeler (13,161 feet [4,011 metres]), the highest point in New Mexico. Western Taos county is a plateau region with isolated mountains, including Ute Peak (10,093 feet [3,076 metres]). The Rio Grande flows through the Picuris Range in a deep gorge, curving from north to southwest. Carson National Forest, including the Latir Peak and Wheeler Peak wildernesses, covers much of the county. The Taos and Picuris Pueblo Indian reservations, Wild Rivers and Orilla Verde national recreation areas, Kit Carson State Park, and the Ski Rio, Red River, Taos, and Sipapu ski areas are among the countyâ€™s other attractions.
The Taos pueblo has been inhabited since 1350 ce. Spanish explorers first arrived in 1540, and a mission church was built at the pueblo in 1617. The Indians at Taos revolted against Spanish rule in 1631, 1680, and 1695; in the 18th century they joined forces with settlers to defend themselves against Ute, Navajo, and Comanche raids; and in 1847 they revolted against U.S. rule. The county was established by Mexico in 1844 and reestablished by the New Mexico Territory of the United States in 1852.
