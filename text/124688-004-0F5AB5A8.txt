Shravasti, Pali Savatthi,  city of ancient India, located near the Rapti River in northeastern Uttar Pradesh state. In Buddhist times (6th century bceâ€“6th century ce), Shravasti was the capital of the kingdom of Kosala and was important both as a prosperous trading centre and for its religious associations. It stood at the junction of three great roads connecting it with the great cities of eastern, northern, and western India. It was closely associated with the life of the Buddha and with figures significant in later Buddhist history. Its most important religious place was the Jetavana Monastery, which was erected in a garden outside the walls of the city and presented to the Buddha by a wealthy banker, Anathapindaka. Other important Buddhist monasteries were the Rajakarama and the Purvarama. Shravasti was also an important centre for the Jainas.
The city has been identified with the twin villages of Saheth and Maheth, northwest of Balrampur. Today it is surrounded by a great rampart of earth and brick. Excavation has been undertaken by the Archaeological Survey of India, and remains of stupas, temples, and monasteries representing three main historical periods have been recognized.
