Max Klinger,  (born February 18, 1857, Leipzig, Germany—died July 5, 1920, near Naumburg) German painter, sculptor, and engraver, whose art of symbol, fantasy, and dreamlike situations belonged to the growing late 19th-century awareness of the subtleties of the mind. Klinger’s visionary art has been linked with that of Arnold Böcklin; the expression of his vivid, frequently morbid imaginings, however, was not noted for technical excellence. His work had a deep influence on Giorgio de Chirico.
Klinger, who had received some training at the Karlsruhe art school, created a sensation at the Berlin Academy exhibition in 1878 with two series of pen-and-ink drawings—Series upon the Theme of Christ and Fantasies upon the Finding of a Glove. Their daring originality caused an outburst of indignation; nonetheless, the Glove series, on which Klinger’s contemporary reputation is based, was bought by the Berlin National Gallery. These 10 drawings (engraved in three editions from 1881) tell a strange parable of a hapless young man and his obsessive involvement with a woman’s elbow-length glove.
