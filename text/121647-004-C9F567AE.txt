Exegesis, the critical interpretation of the biblical text to discover its intended meaning. Both Jews and Christians have used various exegetical methods throughout their history, and doctrinal and polemical intentions have often influenced interpretive results; a given text may yield a number of very different interpretations according to the exegetical presuppositions and techniques applied to it. The study of these methodological principles themselves constitutes the field of hermeneutics.
A brief treatment of exegesis follows. For full treatment, see biblical literature: The critical study of biblical literature: exegesis and hermeneutics.
