Guillaume Farel,  (born 1489, Gap, Dauphiné, France—died September 13, 1565, Neuchâtel, Switzerland) Reformer and preacher primarily responsible for introducing the Reformation to French-speaking Switzerland, where his efforts led to John Calvin’s establishment of the Reformed church in Geneva.
As a student at the University of Paris, Farel was the pupil and friend of the scholar Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples, who helped him obtain a professorship to teach grammar and philosophy at the Collège Cardinal Lemoine in Paris. Farel soon became regent of the college. He embraced the tenets of Christian humanism sometime before 1521, the year he was appointed a diocesan preacher by the Reformist bishop of Meaux, Guillaume Briçonnet.
