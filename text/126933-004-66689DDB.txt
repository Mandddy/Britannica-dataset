The Boswell Sisters, American jazz vocal trio noted for intricate harmonies and rhythmic experimentation; they were also a major influence on vocal artists such as Ella Fitzgerald and the Andrews Sisters. The three sisters were Martha (b. June 9, 1905, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.—d. July 2, 1958, Peekskill, New York), Connee (original name Connie; b. December 3, 1907, New Orleans, Louisiana—d. October 11, 1976, New York, New York), and Helvetia (also called Vet; b. May 20, 1909, Birmingham, Alabama—d. November 12, 1988, Peekskill, New York).
Reared in New Orleans during the early years of jazz, the Boswell Sisters learned music from their black household staff. Trained as instrumentalists, the sisters’ first public performances (including one with the New Orleans Philharmonic) featured Martha on piano, Helvetia (known to all as “Vet”) on violin, guitar, and banjo, and Connee on cello, saxophone, and trombone. By 1925 they had evolved into a singing group, but the few records they cut that year attracted little notice. During an early broadcast engagement, the group accidentally discovered the sound that brought them success. Lead singer Connee found her voice weakened from a cold; to compensate, she moved closer to the microphone and sang at half-volume. The resulting sound gave greater emphasis to the group’s intimate, close harmonies, and Connee Boswell was subsequently regarded by many as the first popular singer to use a microphone for maximum effect.
