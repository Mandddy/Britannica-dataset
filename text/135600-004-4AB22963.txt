Joseph McKenna,  (born Aug. 10, 1843, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Nov. 21, 1926, Washington, D.C.) U.S. Supreme Court justice from 1898 to 1925.
McKenna grew up in California and was admitted to the state bar in 1865. A Republican, he served as Solano county district attorney (1866–70) and in the California state legislature (1875–76). Despite the prevailing anti-Roman Catholic sentiments that contributed to two defeats at the polls, McKenna was elected in his third Congressional bid to the U.S. House of Representatives (1885–92).
