During the Song (960–1279) and Yuan (1279–1368) dynasties, Xiamen was known as Jiahe Island and formed a part of Tong’an county. It was notable chiefly as a lair of pirates and a centre of contraband trade. The name Xiamen first appeared when the island was fortified as one of a series of measures taken against piracy in 1387. During the 1650s it was under the control of Zheng Chenggong, or Koxinga (1624–62), the ruler of Taiwan, at which time it was called Siming prefecture. In 1680 it was taken by the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12), after which it became the headquarters of the Quanzhou naval defense force.
