Chromosphere, lowest layer of the Sun’s atmosphere, several thousand kilometres thick, located above the bright photosphere and below the extremely tenuous corona. The chromosphere (colour sphere), named by the English astronomer Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer in 1868, appears briefly as a bright crescent, red with hydrogen light, during solar eclipses when the body of the Sun is almost obscured by the Moon. The chromosphere can be observed at other times across the face of the Sun in filters that let through the red light of the hydrogen alpha line at 6562.8 angstroms (Å; 1 Å = 10−10 metre). The lower chromosphere is more or less homogeneous. The upper contains comparatively cool columns of ascending gas known as spicules, having between them hotter gas much like that of the corona, into which the upper chromosphere merges gradually. Spicules occur at the edges of the chromosphere’s magnetic network, which traces areas of enhanced field strength. Temperatures in the chromosphere range from about 4,500 to 100,000 Kelvins (K), increasing with altitude; the mean temperature is about 6,000 K. Solar prominences are primarily chromospheric phenomena.
