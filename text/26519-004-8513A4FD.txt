John Montagu, 4th earl of Sandwich,  (born Nov. 13, 1718—died  April 30, 1792, London, Eng.) British first lord of the Admiralty during the American Revolution (1776–81) and the man for whom the sandwich was named.
Having succeeded his grandfather, Edward Montagu, the 3rd Earl, in 1729, he studied at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and traveled abroad and then took his seat in the House of Lords in 1739. He served as postmaster general (1768–70) and secretary of state for the northern department (1763–65, 1770–71). In the latter capacity he took a leading part in the prosecution (1763) of John Wilkes, the British politician and agitator, whose friend he once had been, thereby earning the sobriquet of “Jemmy Twitcher,” after a treacherous character in John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera. He also was first lord of the Admiralty (1748–51, 1771–82). During the latter period his critics accused him of using the office to obtain bribes and to distribute political jobs. Although he was frequently attacked for corruption, his administrative ability has been recognized. However, during the American Revolutionary War he insisted upon keeping much of the British fleet in European waters because of the possibility of French attack, and he was subjected to considerable criticism for insufficient naval preparedness.
