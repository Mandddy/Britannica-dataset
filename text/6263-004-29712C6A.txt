Bandy-bandy (genus Vermicella), Australian snake of the cobra family Elapidae, strikingly ringed with black and white or yellowish bands. Adults are about 50–80 cm (20–31 inches) long and are venomous but inoffensive. Five species of Vermicella are recognized.
The bandy-bandy has a small head and eyes and a slender, cylindrical body. To frighten off enemies the bandy-bandy raises a few coils of its body vertically, presenting an unusual silhouette. It preys exclusively or nearly so on blindsnakes, and females lay eggs in clutches of 2 to 13.
