Ina Donna Coolbrith, original name Josephine Donna Smith  (born March 10, 1841, Nauvoo, Ill., U.S.—died Feb. 29, 1928, Berkeley, Calif.) popular American poet of moderate talent who nonetheless became a major figure in literary and cultural circles of 19th- and early 20th-century San Francisco.
Coolbrith, a niece of Joseph Smith (the founder of Mormonism), was born in the first major Mormon settlement. Shortly thereafter her widowed mother took the family to live in St. Louis, Missouri. About 1851 the family traveled by wagon train to California, and young Josephine, on the saddle of famed scout James P. Beckwourth, became the first white child to cross Beckwourth Pass through the Sierra Nevadas. She attended school in the then small town of Los Angeles and in 1858 married Robert B. Carsley, from whom she was divorced three years later. By that time she had published a few poems in the local newspaper under the name Ina. In 1862, adopting the name Ina Donna Coolbrith (her mother’s maiden name), she moved to San Francisco, where she taught school and continued to write and publish and became a recognized member of the San Francisco literary group that included Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, Charles W. Stoddard, and Cincinnatus H. Miller, whose nickname, Joaquin, she is said to have suggested. When Harte began editing the Overland Monthly in 1868, she became an editorial assistant. Her poems appeared not only in California publications but also in Harper’s, Scribner’s, and other national magazines, and the popularity of her verse spread to England.
