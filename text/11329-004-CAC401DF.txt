Guppy,  (Poecilia reticulata or Lebistes reticulatus), colourful, live-bearing freshwater fish of the family Poeciliidae, popular as a pet in home aquariums. The guppy is hardy, energetic, easily kept, and prolific. The male guppy, much the brighter coloured of the sexes, grows to about 4 centimetres (1 1/2 inches) long; the female is larger and duller in colour. Guppies have been bred in a number of ornate strains characterized by colour or pattern and by shape and size of the tail and dorsal fins. See also live-bearer.
