Kanha National Park, national park in Madhya Pradesh state, central India. The park extends over 122 square miles (316 square km) of the central highlands at an elevation of about 2,000 to 3,000 feet (600 to 900 metres). Originally established as the Banjar Valley Sanctuary in 1935, it became a national park in 1955 and was enlarged in 1964. Rolling, sometimes rugged hills that tend to be flat-topped enclose on three sides a large meadowlike grassland. Although there are occasional patches of bamboo, dense bush, or tall grass high on the slopes and on the hilltops, much of the park consists of dry deciduous woodlands. Fauna includes langurs, wild dogs, tigers, leopards, wild pigs, barking deer, chitals, sambars, swamp deer, gaur, quail, red and gray jungle fowl, and peafowl. The park can be reached by road from Nagpur, Jabalpur, and Mandla. There are observation towers, or machans, and elephants are used for transport in the park, especially when motorable tracks become impassable during the summer monsoon rains.
