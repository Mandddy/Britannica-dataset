Robert Gober,  (born September 12, 1954, Wallingford, Connecticut, U.S.) American sculptor and installation artist known for his eerie and evocative reconsiderations of everyday objects. His common motifs include the human body and domestic objects, with which he examined, often with humour, such notions as religion, sexuality, childhood, and change.
Gober studied at Middlebury College (1972–76), spending his junior year abroad at the Tyler School in Rome, before settling in New York City. After a brief period as a painter, he drew notice in the 1980s with a series of haunting sculptures loosely based on the forms of household items such as sinks, drains, and playpens. Nonfunctional and often altered in scale from their sources—Open Playpen (1987), for example, lacks the protective bars on one side, while X Playpen (1987) effectively reduces the “play” area to one of two tiny triangular spaces—those sculptures seemed exercises in wistful memory, exposing a stark poetry embedded within the mundane and the domestic.
