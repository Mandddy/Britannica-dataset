Henri-Gratien, Comte Bertrand,  (born March 28, 1773, Châteauroux, Fr.—died  Jan. 31, 1844, Châteauroux) French military engineer and general, friend of Napoleon I and his companion in exile, first at Elba (1814–15), then at St. Helena (1815–21). His diary is considered invaluable for its frank account of Napoleon’s character and life in exile. It was decoded, annotated, and published by P. Fleuriot de Langle as Cahiers de Sainte-Hélène, 1816–21, 3 vol. (1949–59, “Notebooks from St. Helena”).
Bertrand entered the army at age 19 as an engineer. After service in Italy (1797), where he first met Napoleon, he was sent to Egypt (1798–99) and directed the fortification of Alexandria. He was appointed brigadier general in 1800. Named aide-de-camp to Napoleon in 1804, he further distinguished himself during the Austrian campaign. The bridges he built for the French crossing of the Danube at Wagram in 1809 were described by Napoleon as the finest since the Romans. Bertrand was created a count in 1808. Appointed grand marshal of the palace in 1813, he later accompanied Napoleon into exile.
