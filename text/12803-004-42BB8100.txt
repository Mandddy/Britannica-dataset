Coach,  railroad passenger car. In early railroad operation, passenger and freight cars were often intermixed, but that practice very soon gave way to running separate freight and passenger trains. The flexible gangway between coaches, introduced about 1880, made the entire train accessible to passengers and so made possible the introduction of the dining car and the club or lounge car. Early coaches were built of wood and usually heated with stoves, making them vulnerable to fire in case of accident; modern coaches are made of steel and heated electrically.
Until recently the standard coach in Europe was divided into six- or eight-seat compartments, with a corridor extending along one side. These have now been largely replaced with coaches on the U.S. model, which have a centre-aisle arrangement, uncompartmented seats, and doors usually at each end of the car.
