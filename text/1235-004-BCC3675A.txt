Rickey Henderson, in full Rickey Henley Henderson   (born December 25, 1958, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) professional baseball player who in 1991 set a record for the most stolen bases in major league baseball and in 2001 set a record for the most career runs scored.
Henderson was an All-American running back in football as a high school athlete in Oakland, California. He chose to play baseball over football, however, and competed in the minor leagues for four seasons. Henderson’s career in the major leagues began with the Oakland Athletics in June 1979. In 1980, his first full season, he became one of only three players ever to have stolen 100 bases, breaking Ty Cobb’s American League record of 96 bases. It was the first of seven consecutive seasons in which Henderson led the American League in stolen bases. In 1982 he broke Lou Brock’s single-season record of 118 stolen bases, set in 1974, with 130 stolen bases. Henderson added 108 stolen bases the following year.
