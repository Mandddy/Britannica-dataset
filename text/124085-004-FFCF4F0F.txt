Pigeon racing, also called Pigeon Flying,  racing for sport the homing pigeon, a specialized variety developed through selective crossbreeding and training for maximum distance and speed in directed flight.
The earliest record of the domestication of pigeons is from the fifth Egyptian dynasty (about 3000 bc). The sultan of Baghdad established a pigeon post system in ad 1150, and Genghis Khan used such a system as his conquests spread. Pigeons were widely used for messenger service in Europe during the Revolution of 1848, and in 1849 pigeons were used to carry messages during interruptions in telegraphic service between Berlin and Brussels. Pigeons were used as emergency message carriers in war well into the 20th century. The record flight for a U.S. Army Signal Corps pigeon was a flight of 2,300 miles (3,700 km). Flights of 1,000 miles (1,600 km) were routine.
