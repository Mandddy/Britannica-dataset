Saint Ansgar,  Ansgar also spelled Anskar, or Anschar   (born probably 801, near Corbie, Austrasia [France]—died  Feb. 3, 865, Bremen, Saxony [Germany]; canonized 865; feast day February 3) missionary of medieval Europe, first archbishop of Hamburg, and the patron saint of Scandinavia.
Of noble birth, Ansgar entered the Benedictine abbey of Corbie in Picardy, where he was educated. After 823 he taught in the monastic school at Corvey (“New Corbie”), Westphalia, where he also began his pastoral work. When Harald, an exiled Danish king, appealed to the Carolingian emperor Louis I the Pious for support, Louis dispatched Ansgar to accompany and assist the king in evangelizing Denmark. Ansgar in 826 began short-lived missionary work in Schleswig. Harald’s downfall in 827 and the death of his assistant, Autbert, were blows to the mission, and in 829 Ansgar returned to the Franks. With the help of Witmar, a monk from Corvey, Ansgar began his evangelization of Sweden. The first to preach the gospel in Sweden, he was cordially received by King Björn.
