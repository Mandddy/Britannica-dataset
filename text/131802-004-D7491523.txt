Barry Byrne, in full Francis Barry Byrne  (born December 19, 1883, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died December 17, 1967, Evanston, Illinois) American architect who emerged from the Prairie school of architecture influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright to develop a number of highly individual styles, especially in his designs for Roman Catholic ecclesiastical buildings. One of his finest works, the reinforced-concrete Church of Christ the King, Cork, Ireland (from 1928), is said to be the first European Catholic church designed by an American architect.
Trained in Wright’s studio in Oak Park, Illinois (1901–07), Byrne worked with Wright’s former associates Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony in Chicago (1907–10, 1914–17), practiced alone in Chicago and then (1930–45) in New York City, and later established an office in the Chicago suburb of Evanston. His square-cut but elegant residence for John Valentine (Muncie, Indiana, 1917) was likened to the best contemporary work of the Viennese avant-garde architect Josef Hoffmann.
