Brook trout, also called Speckled Trout, or Squaretail,   (Salvelinus fontinalis), popular freshwater game fish, a variety of char, regarded for its flavour and its fighting qualities when hooked. The brook trout belongs to the salmon family, Salmonidae. A native of the northeastern United States and Canada, it has been transplanted to many parts of the world. It lives in cold, clean fresh water and is recognized by dark, wormlike markings on the back, red and whitish spots on the body, and white on the leading edge of the lower fins and lower tail-fin lobe. It may weigh up to about three kilograms (six pounds). Some individuals migrate to large lakes or the sea and grow much larger and more silvery.
