Pearl Jam, American band that helped popularize grunge music in the early 1990s. The original members were lead vocalist Eddie Vedder (original name Edward Louis Severson III; b. December 23, 1964, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard (b. July 20, 1966, Seattle, Washington), bassist Jeff Ament (b. March 10, 1963, Havre, Montana), lead guitarist Mike McCready (b. April 5, 1966, Pensacola, Florida), and drummer Dave Krusen (b. March 10, 1966, Tacoma, Washington). Later members included Jack Irons (b. July 18, 1962, Los Angeles, California), Dave Abbruzzese (b. May 17, 1968, Stamford, Connecticut), and Matt Cameron (b. November 28, 1962, San Diego, California).
Pearl Jam came into being in Seattle in 1990 when Gossard and Ament of the glam-influenced rock combo Mother Love Bone decided to form a new band following the death of their group’s lead singer, Andrew Wood. The band was originally named Mookie Blaylock, after a professional basketball player, but settled on the words pearl and jam separately—the latter reportedly after seeing musician Neil Young in concert and admiring his “jam session” style. The band released its first album, Ten, in 1991. Alternative rock had already begun to receive mainstream acceptance, thanks largely to the popularity of Nirvana—who, like Pearl Jam, were part of Seattle’s vibrant music scene—and Ten (featuring the major hits “Jeremy,” “Evenflow,” and “Alive”) became a multimillion-seller.
