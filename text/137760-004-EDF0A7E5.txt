Calgary, city, southern Alberta, Canada. The physical setting of Calgary distinguishes it from other cities of the Prairie Provinces. It is situated on the western edge of the Great Plains, in the foothills of the spectacular Canadian Rockies (about 60 miles [100 km] to the west), and the surrounding valleys and uplands are a distinct change from the flat prairie landscapes typical of the region. A relatively young Canadian city and the administrative and financial headquarters of the country’s petroleum industry, Calgary also celebrates its history as a cattle-ranching capital, an image enhanced by the city’s hosting of the annual Calgary Stampede, a 10-day rodeo-centred event. In the early 21st century Calgary was one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada. Area city, 319 square miles (825 square km); metro. area, 1,972 square miles (5,108 square km). Pop. (2006) 988,812; metro. area, 1,079,310; (2011) 1,096,833; metro. area, 1,214,839.
In 1875 a North-West Mounted Police (later Royal Canadian Mounted Police) post known unofficially as Fort Brisebois was founded on the site of present-day Calgary. The following year it was officially named Fort Calgary for a town on the Scottish island of Mull. The main duty of the police was to bring order to the illegal whiskey trade in the region. In 1877 the British and Canadian governments signed a peace agreement (Treaty 7) with a number of First Nations (Native American) peoples, and the region rapidly converted to a cattle-ranching frontier.
