Charlotte Corday, in full Marie-Anne-Charlotte Corday d’Armont  (born July 27, 1768, Saint-Saturnin, near Séez, Normandy, France—died July 17, 1793, Paris) the assassin of the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat.
Descended from a noble family, educated in a convent at Caen, and royalist by sentiment, yet susceptible also to the ideals of the Enlightenment, Corday was living with an aunt in Caen when it became a centre of the “federalist” movement against the National Convention after the expulsion of the Girondins in May–June 1793. Inspired especially by Charles Barbaroux among the Girondin refugees, she left for Paris to work for the Girondin cause.
