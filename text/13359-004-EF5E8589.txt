Arsinoe II,  (born c. 318–314 (316?) bce—died July 270/268 bce) queen (basilissa) of Thrace and Macedonia and, later, the wife of her younger brother, King Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt, and possibly his coruler. It has been inferred by modern historians that she wielded great power in both roles, though the extent of that power is contested. Some scholars contend that the impression of her puissance in Egypt was the effect of symbolic efforts by her brother-husband.
Various—and sometimes contradictory—accounts, or references to, the life of Arsinoe are found in the writings of Pausanias, Memnon (by way of Nymphis), Strabo, Polybius, Plutarch, Polyaenus, and Justin. She was the daughter of Berenice I and Ptolemy I Soter, who was one of the Diadochi (“successors”) of Alexander the Great and the founder of the Macedonian (Ptolemaic) dynasty in Egypt following Alexander’s death in 323 bce.
