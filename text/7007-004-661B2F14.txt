The adult bush pig stands 64–76 cm (25–30 inches) tall at the shoulder. Its coat colour ranges from reddish brown to blackish, with black-and-white face markings and a white crest on the back. There are several subspecies of bush pig, among them the reddish brown animal called the red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus porcus).
