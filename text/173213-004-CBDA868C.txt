Martin Opitz, in full Martin Opitz von Boberfeld  (born December 23, 1597, Bunzlau, Silesia [now Bolesławiec, Poland]—died August 20, 1639, Danzig [now Gdańsk, Poland]) German poet and literary theorist who introduced foreign literary models into German poetry and who was a pioneer in establishing a national German literature.
Opitz studied at universities in Frankfurt an der Oder, Heidelberg, and Leiden, where he met the Dutch poet Daniël Heinsius. He led a wandering life in the service of various territorial nobles. In 1625, as a reward for a requiem poem on the death of Charles Joseph of Austria, he was crowned laureate by the Holy Roman emperor Ferdinand II, who later ennobled him. In 1629 he was elected to the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, the most important of the literary societies that aimed to reform the German language. He went to Paris in 1630, where he made the acquaintance of the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius. He lived from 1635 until his death at Danzig (Gdańsk), where Władysław IV of Poland made him his historiographer and secretary.
