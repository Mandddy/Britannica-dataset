Paulo Coelho,  (born August 24, 1947, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) Brazilian novelist known for employing rich symbolism in his depictions of the often spiritually motivated journeys taken by his characters.
Coelho was raised in Rio de Janeiro. He rebelled against the conventions of his Roman Catholic upbringing and, as a result, was temporarily committed to a psychiatric hospital by his parents. Coelho dropped out of law school in 1970 and traveled through South America, Mexico, North Africa, and Europe. In 1972 he returned home and began writing pop and rock music lyrics with Raul Seixas, a well-known Brazilian singer and songwriter. In 1974 Coelho was briefly imprisoned for alleged subversive activities against the Brazilian government.
