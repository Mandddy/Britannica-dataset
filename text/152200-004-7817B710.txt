Crurotarsan, also called pseudosuchian or crocodylotarsan,  any member of clade Crurotarsi, the group of archosaurs, or “ruling reptiles,” more closely related to modern crocodiles than modern birds. Although the group flourished during the Triassic Period (251 million to 200 million years ago) and most lineages have become extinct, some representatives, the crocodilians, still survive. Crurotarsi means “cross-ankles” in Latin, a name derived from the arrangement of the bones in their ankles that allows for two distinct walking postures.
The crurotarsans make up one of the two major clades of archosaurs. (The members of clade Avemetatarsalia, which include dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and modern birds, make up the second group.) Crurotarsans are distinguished from other archosaurs by the arrangement of the bones in their ankles; the connection between the astragalus (the talus, or medial proximal ankle bone) and the calcaneum (the lateral proximal ankle bone) in crurotarsans is a peg-in-socket, which allows for ankle rotation. This adaptation enables the animal to display a “high walk” (which elevates the body when the animal’s legs are brought inward toward the midline of the body) and a sprawling stance (which lowers the body when the legs are spread far apart from one another). In contrast, the ankle bones in other archosaurs allow the foot to bend only one way, which limited these animals to a more-erect posture.
