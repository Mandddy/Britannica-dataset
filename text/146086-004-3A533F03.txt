Váh River,  tributary of the Danube River in Slovakia. Rising in the Tatra Mountains as the Biely Váh (in the High Tatras) and Čierny Váh (in the Low Tatras), the river describes a long arc to the west and south. It joins the Little Danube to become the Váh Danube (Vážský Dunaj), which forms the eastern limit of Great Rye Island, and after several miles enters the Danube River at Komárno, in extreme southern Slovakia, after a course of 242 miles (390 km). The area of its drainage basin is 4,109 square miles (10,641 square km). The Váh has a large number of tributaries, many of which fall steeply off the Tatras and the outer ranges of the Carpathians. The east-west valley formed by its upper course provides a natural transportation route across Slovakia that is followed by major road and rail arteries; the river’s north-south valley between Žilina and Bratislava similarly serves as a corridor. The river flows rapidly—particularly when swollen by seasonal meltwater, since the Tatras have few storage lakes—through a picturesque valley. There are numerous small hydroelectric-power stations along the Váh.
