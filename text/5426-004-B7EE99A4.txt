Vasily Pavlovich Aksyonov, Aksyonov also spelled Aksenov   (born Aug. 20, 1932, Kazan, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died July 6, 2009, Moscow, Russia) Russian novelist and short-story writer, one of the leading literary spokesmen for the generation of Soviets who reached maturity after World War II.
The son of parents who spent many years in Soviet prisons, Aksyonov was raised in a state home and graduated from medical school in 1956. After working for a few years as a doctor, he turned to writing, and in the cultural thaw of the late 1950s and early ’60s he published a number of short stories and novels. His novels Kollegi (1960; Colleagues), Zvezdnyi bilet (1961; A Ticket to the Stars), and Apelsiny iz Morokko (1963; “Oranges from Morocco”) are fast-moving narratives dealing with youthful rebels and misfits in Soviet society. In these books Aksyonov excels in reproducing the racy slang and jargon of characters who are attracted to Western culture even though they share the collectivist ideals of the previous generation.
