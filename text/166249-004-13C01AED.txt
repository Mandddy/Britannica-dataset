Adams family, Massachusetts family with deep roots in American history whose members made major contributions to the nation’s political and intellectual life for more than 150 years.
Established in America by Henry Adams, who emigrated from England to Massachusetts Bay Colony about 1636, the family made no special mark until the time of John Adams (1735–1826). Perhaps the most profound political philosopher of the Revolutionary and early national periods of U.S. history, Adams also served as the country’s second president (1797–1801). His wife, Abigail Adams (1744–1818), left a voluminous correspondence testifying to her wit, literary capabilities, and political insight. John’s cousin Samuel Adams (1722–1803) was the firebrand of Revolutionary Boston, constantly organizing protests against British policies and shrewdly directing public opinion toward the goal of independence.
