Carmarthenshire, also called Carmarthen, Welsh Sir Gaerfyrddin,  county of southwestern Wales, extending inland from the Bristol Channel. The present county is coterminous with the historic county of the same name. It rises from sea level along the Bristol Channel to an elevation of more than 2,000 feet (600 metres) at Black Mountain in the east. Carmarthen is the administrative centre and the historic county town (seat) of Carmarthenshire.
On the hills above the 600-foot (180-metre) contour, there are Stone Age tumuli and cairns and, especially in the northwest, various stone monuments. Roman hilltop camps stood on spurs of the high ground. During the post-Roman centuries the Celtic saints reflected the Christian faith of the county, which suffered numerous raids by the Irish and the Scandinavians. The strong reign of Rhodri Mawr (c. 870) is said to have brought a measure of peace, and his grandson Howel the Good (Hywel Dda) was the first to codify the ancient laws of Wales at his palace, Ty-Gwyn-ar-DÃ¢f (near modern Whitland). After 1080 the Normans entered the area, built castles along the coast, and gradually penetrated the valleys to Carmarthen and Llandeilo. The campaigns of the English king Edward I gave the Normans a more unified control of the principality, and the Statutes of Rhuddlan (1284) created the county of Carmarthenshire. In 1536, under Henry VIII, the county was enlarged. The hill country, an area ideal for sheep raising, made Carmarthenshire famous for its wool in the later Middle Ages.
