Nikolaos Sokrates Politis,  (born Feb. 7, 1872, Corfu, Greece—died  March 4, 1942, Cannes, Fr.) Greek jurist and diplomat, a champion of disarmament and the peaceful settlement of disputes. He was president of the Institute of International Law (1937–42) and was largely responsible for the founding of the Academy of International Law at The Hague.
After holding law professorships at Aix-en-Provence, Poitiers, and Paris, Politis was summoned in 1914 to reorganize the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of which he became director general. After becoming Greece’s minister of foreign affairs in 1916, he attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 as the Greek delegate. Later, as the representative of Greece in the League of Nations, he wrote the report on the Geneva Protocol (1924), and, as vice president of the Disarmament Conference, he framed the official League definition of aggression. Among Politis’ published works on jurisprudence are La Justice internationale (1924) and Les Nouvelles Tendances du droit international (1927; New Aspects of International Law).
