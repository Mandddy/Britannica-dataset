Jonas Kaufmann,  (born July 10, 1969, Munich, West Germany) German opera tenor renowned for his extraordinary technique, his versatility as a performer of German, French, and Italian repertoire, and his charismatic projection of a range of emotions.
Kaufmann was raised in a family of music lovers but not of professional musicians. His mother was a kindergarten teacher, and his father worked for an insurance company. From an early age Kaufmann developed an inclination toward classical music, largely through listening to his father’s records and attending special performances for children at the Bavarian State Opera. He started to take piano lessons when he was about eight years old, but he was not particularly enchanted with the activity. By contrast, he was captivated whenever his grandfather took a seat at the piano to play from opera scores by Richard Wagner while singing the various vocal parts. It was these performances that ultimately kindled Kaufmann’s desire to become an opera singer.
