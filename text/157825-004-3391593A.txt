Ben Affleck, in full Benjamin Geza Affleck-Boldt  (born August 15, 1972, Berkeley, California, U.S.) American actor and filmmaker who played leading roles in action, drama, and comedy films but who was perhaps more renowned for his work as a screenwriter, director, and producer.
Affleck grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he formed a lasting friendship with his neighbour Matt Damon. Affleck’s first role was in a Burger King commercial, and in 1984 he appeared in the Public Broadcasting Service’s miniseries The Voyage of the Mimi. He continued acting as a teenager in the TV movie Hands of a Stranger (1987) and in The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988). Affleck briefly attended both the University of Vermont and Occidental College but left before graduating, to focus on acting. During his early career his height and stature often got him cast as a bully, and he played minor characters in independent films such as the cult hits Dazed and Confused (1993) and Kevin Smith’s Mallrats (1995). Smith was impressed by Affleck and cast him as the lead in his next film, Chasing Amy (1997).
