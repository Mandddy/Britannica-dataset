Thaddeus Stevens,  (born April 4, 1792, Danville, Vermont, U.S.—died August 11, 1868, Washington, D.C.) U.S. Radical Republican congressional leader during Reconstruction (1865–77) who battled for freedmen’s rights and insisted on stern requirements for readmission of Southern states into the Union after the Civil War (1861–65).
Admitted to the Maryland bar, he moved to Pennsylvania to practice law in 1816. Having witnessed the oppressive slave system at close range, he early developed a fierce hatred of bondage and defended numbers of fugitives without fee. An anti-Masonic member of the state legislature (1833–41), he proved himself a friend of banks, internal improvements, and public schools and a foe of Freemasons, Jacksonian Democrats, and slaveholders. Serving as a Whig in the U.S. House of Representatives (1849–53), he advocated tariff increases and opposed the fugitive slave provision of the Compromise of 1850.
