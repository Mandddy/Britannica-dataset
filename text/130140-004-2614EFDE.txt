Iglesia ni Cristo  (INC), (
        Tagalog: “Church of Christ”) Cristo also spelled Kristo,  international Christian religious movement that constitutes the largest indigenous Christian church in the Philippines. It was established by Félix Ysagun Manalo in 1914.
Manalo (birth name Félix Manalo ý Ysagun) was raised in the Roman Catholic Church but left as a teenager. During his teens and 20s he adopted Methodism and then Seventh-day Adventism before preaching the need for a return to the original Christian church established by Jesus Christ. Manalo first founded a church in Manila but soon left to preach throughout the country. He attracted some followers who identified him with the “angel ascending from the East,” which is mentioned in chapter 7, verse 2 of the Revelation to John, the last book of the New Testament. That claim gained credence among his followers after the outbreak of World War I, which coincidentally occurred on July 28, 1914, one day after Manalo registered Iglesia ni Cristo with the Philippine government. Church members saw Manalo not only as the angel from Revelation but also as God’s last sugo, or messenger.
