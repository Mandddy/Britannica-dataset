Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), also called intermedin or melanotropin,  any of several peptides derived from a protein known as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and secreted primarily by the pituitary gland. In most vertebrates, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) peptides are secreted specifically by the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and function primarily in skin darkening, with an array of other, minor activities.
The MSH peptides include α-MSH, β-MSH, and γ-MSH. They are distinguished from one other by their preferential binding to different melanocortin receptors (MCRs), through which they exert their effects, and by their structure, with each arising from a different region of POMC. The α-MSH peptide, for example, is derived from the middle region of POMC, whereas β-MSH is derived from the C-terminus (the end containing a carboxyl group) and γ-MSH from the N-terminus (the end containing an amine group). Another peptide produced from the cleavage of POMC is adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which can be further cleaved to form α-MSH. The α-MSH peptide contains 13 amino acids, which are found in the same sequence in all species studied. β-MSH and γ-MSH vary in length and sequence. The different amino-acid sequences of the MSH peptides are thought to account for their ability to activate different MCRs.
