Urban VIII, original name Maffeo Barberini  (baptized April 5, 1568, Florence—died July 29, 1644, Rome) pope from 1623 to 1644.
The son of an aristocratic Florentine family, Barberini filled many distinguished church appointments. He served as papal legate in France (1601) and was simultaneously appointed (1604) archbishop of Nazareth and nuncio to Paris. Pope Paul V made him cardinal in 1606 and bishop of Spoleto in 1608. He became an astute politician during these years, acquiring many friends and making few enemies. He was elected Pope Gregory XV’s successor on Aug. 6, 1623.
