Ultraviolet radiation, that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum extending from the violet, or short-wavelength, end of the visible light range to the X-ray region. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is undetectable by the human eye, although, when it falls on certain materials, it may cause them to fluoresce—i.e., emit electromagnetic radiation of lower energy, such as visible light. Many insects, however, are able to see ultraviolet radiation.
Ultraviolet radiation lies between wavelengths of about 400 nanometres (1 nanometre [nm] is 10−9 metre) on the visible-light side and about 10 nm on the X-ray side, though some authorities extend the short-wavelength limit to 4 nm. In physics, ultraviolet radiation is traditionally divided into four regions: near (400–300 nm), middle (300–200 nm), far (200–100 nm), and extreme (below 100 nm). In biology, three conventional divisions have been observed: near (400–315 nm), which is absorbed relatively poorly by organisms; actinic (315–200 nm), which is absorbed most readily by organic matter and thus has the greatest effects on organisms; and vacuum (less than 200 nm), which is absorbed by most substances, including oxygen in the air (and below 100 nm nitrogen), and so is of little use in biological experimentation. Based on the interaction of wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation with biological materials, three divisions have been designated: UVA (400–315 nm), also called black light; UVB (315–280 nm), responsible for the radiation’s best-known effects on organisms; and UVC (280–100 nm), which does not reach Earth’s surface.
