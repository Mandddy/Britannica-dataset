Vaulting, gymnastics exercise in which the athlete leaps over a form that was originally intended to mimic a horse. At one time the pommel horse (side horse) was used in the vaulting exercise, with the pommels (handles) removed. Later a cylindrical form made especially for vaulting was used. The sanctioning body for gymnastic sport, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), decreed in 2001 that a vaulting table would replace the horse. With its curved front, the vaulting table was designed for the greater safety of the gymnast.
In men’s vaulting the horse was placed lengthwise, and the vaulting table is placed in that same position whether for men or for women. For men the height of the apparatus is 1.35 metres (4.43 feet) measured from the floor. A Reuther board (also called a beatboard), a special type of springboard developed in Germany, is placed in front of the near end of the apparatus. The gymnast takes a run, gathers momentum as he or she nears the apparatus, rebounds off the springboard, and, with hands on the apparatus, vaults over it. A variety of tricks may be performed, such as vaulting over with straddled legs, with legs together and bent into a squatting position, or with legs straight and the hips bent, as well as handsprings, cartwheels, and other more difficult movements. Each vault is evaluated according to a table of standards of difficulty.
