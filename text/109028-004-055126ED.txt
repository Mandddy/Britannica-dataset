Art market, physical or figurative venue in which art is bought and sold. At its most basic an art market requires a work of art, which might be drawn from a very wide range of collectible objects; a seller; and a buyer, who may participate directly in negotiations or be represented by agents.
Historically, some of the most significant art transactions have taken place outside the framework of what is now understood as an art market. The most common of these transactions involved the artist or craftsman and a patron, who might be either a private individual or, as was often the case in the European Middle Ages (approximately 450–1400 ce), an institution such as the Roman Catholic Church. In such cases the work of art might be site-specific, as with a fresco or an altarpiece. These works of art would not, and indeed could not, be traded on the open market, and the artist was not the “owner” in the modern sense. Instead, the patron and the artist would draw up a contract in which the price of materials, the subject of the piece, and the number of figures were generally determined in advance. The price of the artist’s skill and labour was often agreed upon separately, through an external adjudication. In addition to these and other direct commissions, there was an open market of growing importance in more portable commodities, such as textiles, curiosities, and antiquities.
