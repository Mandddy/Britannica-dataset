Ann Preston,  (born December 1, 1813, West Grove, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 18, 1872, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) American physician and educator who struggled for the rights of women to learn, practice, and teach medicine in the mid-1800s.
Preston was educated in Quaker schools and later became active in the abolition and temperance movements. Her temperance work had aroused in her an interest in physiology and hygiene, and she studied those subjects as well as Latin on her own for a time. She began to teach classes in physiology and hygiene to other interested women and in 1847 became a medical apprentice in the office of a physician friend in Philadelphia. Two years later, having completed her apprenticeship, Preston was refused admission to all four Philadelphia medical colleges because of her sex. In October 1850, however, she entered the newly established Female (later Woman’s) Medical College of Pennsylvania with the first class, and she graduated in 1851. After further study she was appointed professor of physiology and hygiene at the college in 1853.
