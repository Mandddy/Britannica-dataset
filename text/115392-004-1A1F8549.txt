Peter Abrahams, in full Peter Henry Abrahams   (born March 19, 1919, Vrededorp, near Johannesburg, S.Af.) most prolific of South Africa’s black prose writers, whose early novel Mine Boy (1946) was the first to depict the dehumanizing effect of racism upon South African blacks.
Abrahams left South Africa at the age of 20, settling first in Britain and then in Jamaica; nevertheless, most of his novels and short stories are based on his early life in South Africa. Mine Boy, for example, tells of a country youth thrown into the alien and oppressive culture of a large South African industrial city. Abrahams’s semiautobiographical Tell Freedom: Memories of Africa (1954; new ed. 1970) deals with the related theme of his struggles as a youth in the slums of Johannesburg. The Path of Thunder (1948) depicts a young “mixed” couple who love under the menacing shadow of enforced segregation. Wild Conquest (1950) follows the great northern trek of the Boers, and A Night of Their Own (1965) sets forth the plight of the Indian in South Africa. The novel A Wreath for Udomo (1956; new ed. 1971) and the travel book This Island Now (1966; new ed. 1971) are set in western Africa and the Caribbean, respectively. Abrahams’s The View from Coyaba (1985) chronicles four generations of a Jamaican family and their experiences with racism. He also wrote the memoir The Coyaba Chronicles: Reflections on the Black Experience in the 20th Century (2000).
