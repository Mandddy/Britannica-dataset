James Kirke Paulding,  (born Aug. 22, 1778, Dutchess county, N.Y., U.S.—died  April 6, 1860, Hyde Park, N.Y.) dramatist, novelist, and public official chiefly remembered for his early advocacy and use of native American material in literature.
At 18 he went to New York City, where he formed a lasting friendship with the Irving brothers. This association aroused his enthusiasm for literature, and he, with William and Washington Irving, founded the Salmagundi (1807–08), a periodical consisting mainly of light satires on local subjects. The outbreak of hostilities between England and America encouraged the assertion of Paulding’s nationalism. He satirized England’s conduct toward America during the war in The Diverting History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan (1812) and The Lay of the Scottish Fiddle: A Tale of Havre de Grace (1813), the latter a burlesque of Sir Walter Scott. The same spirit of nationalism found expression in two later satires also directed at the British: A Sketch of Old England: by a New England Man (1822) and John Bull in America (1825).
