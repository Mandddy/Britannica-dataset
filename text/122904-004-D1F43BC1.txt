Gazpacho,  cold soup of Spanish cuisine, especially that of Andalusia. It is an ancient dish mentioned in Greek and Roman literature, although two of the main ingredients of the modern version, tomatoes and green peppers, were brought to Spain from the New World only in the 16th century. Spanish cookbooks classify gazpacho as a salad.
The most frequently encountered gazpacho is an uncooked mixture of tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, water, vinegar, onions, cucumbers, and green peppers, thickened with bread crumbs. The word gazpacho is derived from the Arabic for “soaked bread.” Gazpacho may be served with croutons, additional chopped vegetables, and chopped egg that the diners add to taste. The gazpacho of Málaga province in Andalusia is based on almonds and contains grapes.
