Boletaceae, a family of fungi of the order Boletales (phylum Basidiomycota, kingdom Fungi), in which the fruiting structures bear pores rather than gills (as in the Agaricales). Some edible mushrooms are included in the family’s more than 250 cosmopolitan species. They usually can be found in the woods during hot, rainy periods.
Several of the 50 species of the genus Boletus are edible. The undersurfaces range from red to brown in colour. The cepe (B. edulis) is found in woods and groves of trees during July and August. The 50 species of Suillus form mycorrhizal associations (nutritional “partnerships”) between the filaments of the fungus and the roots of certain trees.
