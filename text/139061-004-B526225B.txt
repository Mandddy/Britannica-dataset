Anthony Kennedy, in full Anthony McLeod Kennedy  (born July 23, 1936, Sacramento, California, U.S.) associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1988.
Kennedy received a bachelor’s degree from Stanford University in 1958 and a law degree from Harvard University in 1961. He was admitted to the bar in 1962 and subsequently practiced law in San Francisco and Sacramento, California. In 1965 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at the University of the Pacific’s McGeorge School of Law, where he taught until 1988. In 1975 Kennedy was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and in that capacity he established himself as a distinguished candidate to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court created by the retirement of Justice Lewis Powell in 1987. Instead, President Ronald Reagan nominated Robert H. Bork, whose outspoken demeanour and sharply conservative views on constitutional law and social policy led to his rejection by the Senate. The quieter Kennedy was eventually nominated and was unanimously confirmed.
