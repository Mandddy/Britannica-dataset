Little Caesar, American gangster film, released in 1931, considered a classic of the genre.
In a critically acclaimed performance, Edward G. Robinson plays Rico Bandello, a petty crook who ultimately schemes his way to the top of a Chicago mob. His newfound status, however, puts him at odds with his boyhood friend Joe (played by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), and the resulting conflict leads to his downfall. With a face curled into a perennial scowl and his “School of Hard Knocks” charisma, Robinson’s Rico (known to intimates as Little Caesar) epitomized the contemporary urban gangster stereotype.
