Mine, in military and naval operations, a usually stationary explosive device that is designed to destroy personnel, ships, or vehicles when the latter come in contact with it. Submarine mines have been in use since the mid-19th century; land mines did not become a significant factor in warfare until a hundred years later.
A submarine mine is an underwater weapon consisting of an explosive charge fitted with a device that causes it to explode when a ship or submarine enters into close proximity. Usually emplaced by specialized vessels called minelayers or dropped by specialized aircraft, submarine mines are steel spheres or ovate shapes that contain enough air to enable the mine to float in the water. The mine is anchored in place, its depth beneath the surface depending on the length of the cable by which it is tethered. When touched or approached by the hull of a vessel, the mine explodes. Highly destructive yet relatively cheaply built, mines are effective naval weapons. They are used offensively by being placed where enemy vessels are expected to pass, especially in or just outside enemy harbours. Defensively, mines are placed in carefully and secretly charted locations adjacent to the defender’s harbours and installations, and they are usually staggered at varying depths to protect against both submarines and surface vessels. Saboteurs or commandos sometimes covertly attach mines to vessels’ hulls for later explosion by timer or remote control. The typical submarine mine contains about 225 kg (500 pounds) of explosives.
