Ranunculaceae, the buttercup family (order Ranunculales), comprising about 2,252 species in 62 genera of flowering plants, mostly herbs, which are widely distributed in all temperate and subtropical regions. In the tropics they occur mostly at high elevations.
The leaves are usually alternate and stalkless and may be simple or much divided, often with sheathing bases. The flowers usually have two to five free sepals and may be radially symmetrical or irregular. The petals are free and sometimes numerous but usually number five or fewer. The male and female parts (stamens and pistils) are usually numerous and are always separate from each other.
