Bennington, county, southwestern Vermont, U.S., bordered by New York state to the west, Massachusetts to the south, and the Green Mountains to the east. The Taconic Mountains in the west are forested by hardwoods, hemlock, and white pine and are separated by a narrow valley from the Green Mountains in the east, which are forested by spruce, fir, and hardwoods. The county is drained by Otter Creek and Batten Kill and by the West, Deerfield, Hoosic, and Walloomsac rivers. Parklands include Emerald Lake and Woodford state parks as well as McCullough Woods and Howe Pond State Forest. Green Mountain National Forest, which includes a segment of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and several ski areas, occupies the eastern half of the county.
Created in March 1778, Bennington is the oldest extant county in Vermont. It is named for Benning Wentworth, a colonial governor. The county seat is shared by Bennington and Manchester, which has long been a resort village. Bennington, the first town formed by the New Hampshire Grants (1749), was the unofficial headquarters of the Green Mountain Boys (founded 1770), a patriot militia that helped defeat the British at the nearby Battle of Bennington (August 16, 1777) in the American Revolution; Bennington College (1932) is located there. The first commercial marble quarry in the United States opened at Dorset in 1785. Other communities are Pownal, Shaftsbury, and Arlington.
