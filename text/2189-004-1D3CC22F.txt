Pare Lorentz,  (born Dec. 11, 1905, Clarksburg, W.Va., U.S.—died  March 4, 1992, Armonk, N.Y.) American filmmaker whose government-sponsored documentaries focused attention on the waste of human and natural resources in the United States in the 1930s.
Lorentz was a well-known movie critic in New York City when, in 1935, he was requested to set up a federal government film program that would effectively highlight the problems of American agriculture. A film-production unit was formed under the sponsorship of the Resettlement Administration (later, it became part of the Department of Agriculture), and the following year Lorentz’ The Plow That Broke the Plains (1936) was released. A classic among documentary films, it recounts, with a harmonious blend of poetic images, narrative, and music, the agricultural misuse of the Great Plains that resulted in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Lorentz then wrote and directed The River (1937) for the Department of Agriculture. This history of the Mississippi River basin and the effect of the Tennessee Valley Authority on the area further realized the potential of the documentary as a powerful impetus to social change. The two films were commercially and artistically successful both in the United States and abroad and stirred widespread discussion not only of the problems presented but also of the documentary approach to filmmaking.
