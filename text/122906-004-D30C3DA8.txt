Halvah, also spelled Helva,  any of several confections of Balkan and eastern Mediterranean origin, made with honey, flour, butter, and sesame seeds or semolina, pressed into loaf form or cut into squares. Halvah is made with a variety of colourings and flavourings. Its texture is characteristically gritty and crisp.
In some versions, sugar and nuts, often pignolia nuts or blanched almonds, are substituted for the more traditional honey and sesame seeds. In either case, the sweet syrup is added to a saut√©ed mixture of butter, nuts, and farina. These are blended thoroughly, then covered and cooked until all the syrup is absorbed. The candy is often sprinkled with cinnamon or served warm or cold with whipped cream.
