Frances Hodgson Burnett, née Frances Eliza Hodgson   (born Nov. 24, 1849, Manchester, Eng.—died  Oct. 29, 1924, Plandome, N.Y., U.S.) American playwright and author who wrote the popular novel Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Frances Hodgson grew up in increasingly straitened circumstances after the death of her father in 1854. In 1865 the family immigrated to the United States and settled in New Market, near Knoxville, Tennessee, where the promise of support from a maternal uncle failed to materialize. In 1868 Hodgson managed to place a story with Godey’s Lady’s Book. Within a few years she was being published regularly in Godey’s, Peterson’s Ladies’ Magazine, Scribner’s Monthly, and Harper’s. In 1873, after a year’s visit to England, she married Dr. Swan Moses Burnett of New Market (divorced 1898).
