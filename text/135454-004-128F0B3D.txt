Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Ukrainian in full Bohdan Zinoviy Mykhaylovych Khmelnytsky, Polish Bohdan Chmielnicki, Russian Bogdan Khmelnitsky  (born c. 1595, Chigirin, Ukraine—died Aug. 6 [Aug. 16, New Style], 1657, Chigirin) leader (1648–57) of the Zaporozhian Cossacks who organized a rebellion against Polish rule in Ukraine that ultimately led to the transfer of the Ukrainian lands east of the Dnieper River from Polish to Russian control.
Although he had been educated in Poland and had served with Polish military forces against the Turks, Khmelnytsky, who had become chief of the Cossacks at Czyhryn, quarreled with the Polish governor of that region and was forced to flee (December 1647) to the fortress of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, a semimilitary community that had developed from runaway serfs, bandits, and traders who had settled along the Dnieper River. He then organized a rebellion among the Zaporozhian Cossacks and, with the support of the Crimean Tatars, marched against the Poles in April 1648. His victorious advance won him additional support from the dissatisfied peasants, townspeople, and clergy of Ukraine, who joined him in a mass uprising that enabled him to enter Poland proper and seize Lwów (now Lviv) in October 1648.
