Ante Trumbić,  (born May 27, 1864, Split, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary [now in Croatia]—died  November 18, 1938, Zagreb, Yugoslavia [now in Croatia]) Croatian nationalist from Dalmatia who played a leading role in the founding of Yugoslavia.
Trumbić entered political life under the Austrian crown, first as a member of the Dalmatian Diet from 1895 and then as representative in the Reichsrat (federal assembly) in Vienna from 1897. In 1905 he was elected mayor of Split. As an advocate of South Slav unity opposed to Habsburg supremacy, Trumbić helped to draft the Rijeka Resolution (1905), by which it was hoped to win the support of anti-Habsburg Hungarians. The scheme failed.
