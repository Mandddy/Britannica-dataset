Dinohyus,  extinct genus of giant piglike mammals found as fossils in deposits of early Miocene age in North America (the Miocene Epoch occurred 23.7 to 5.3 million years ago). Dinohyus is the last and largest of a group of mammals called entelodonts, an early offshoot of the primitive swine stock. As large as a bison, it stood at least 2 m (6 feet) tall at the shoulder; the skull alone was about 1 m (more than 3 feet) long and had many bony flanges and protuberances. The braincase was extremely small. The teeth were very distinctive: the incisors were blunt, while the canines were stout and must have been effective weapons. The neck was short and thick, and the spines in the anterior elements of the backbone were very long and formed a pronounced hump at the shoulders of the animal. Dinohyus was probably a root eater.
