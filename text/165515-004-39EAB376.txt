Dolmen, a type of stone monument found in a variety of places throughout the world. Dolmens are made of two or more upright stones with a single stone lying across them. The most widely known dolmens are found in northwest Europe, notably in the region of Brittany, France; southern Scandinavia; Britain; Ireland; and the Low Countries. The term dolmen is also used in relation to sites in central and southern Europe, particularly central and southern France, the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean. Dolmens are also known from parts of Africa and Asia. More than 30,000 such monuments, making up some two-fifths of the world’s total, are in Korea alone, and in 2000 three of the Korean dolmen sites—at Koch’ang (Gochang), Hwasun, and Kanghwa (Ganghwa) in South Korea—were designated UNESCO World Heritage sites.
The dolmens of northwest Europe were built in the early Neolithic Period (New Stone Age), which began in Brittany about 5000 bce and in Britain, Ireland and southern Scandinavia about 4000 bce. Sites in central and southern Europe were constructed at a similar date, but that corresponds to the middle or late Neolithic in those areas. Outside Europe, dolmens were built over a broad date range, and they continue to be constructed in some parts of the world—such as the island of Sumba, Indonesia—up to the present day.
