Maha-shivaratri, (
        Sanskrit: “Great Night of Shiva”) the most important sectarian festival of the year for devotees of the Hindu god Shiva. The 14th day of the dark half of each lunar month is specially sacred to Shiva, but when it occurs in the month of Magha (January–February) and, to a lesser extent, in the month of Phalguna (February–March), it is a day of particular rejoicing. The preceding day the participant observes a fast and at night a vigil during which a special worship of the lingam (symbol of Shiva) is performed. The following day is celebrated with feasting, festival fairs, and, among the members of the South Indian Lingayat sect, the giving of gifts to the guru (personal spiritual guide).
