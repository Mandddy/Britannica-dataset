Steeplechase, in athletics (track-and-field), a footrace over an obstacle course that includes such obstacles as water ditches, open ditches, and fences.
The sport dates back to a cross-country race at the University of Oxford in 1850. As an Olympic track event (for men only), it was first run in the 1900 Games, and by the 1920 Games it was standardized at 3,000 metres, or about 7.5 laps on a 400-metre track. The steeplechase is also contested at a distance of 2,000 metres in international meets, though not at the Olympic Games. Scandinavian runners, such as Volmari Iso-Hollo of Finland, were the top finishers from the 1920s through the â€™40s, but Kenyan athletes, led by Kip Keino and Moses Kiptanui, came to dominate the event after midcentury.
