Vinnie Ream,  (born September 25, 1847, Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.â€”died November 20, 1914, Washington, D.C.) American sculptor, who is best remembered for her sculpture of Abraham Lincoln in the rotunda of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
Ream had a peripatetic childhood, but in 1861 her family settled in Washington, D.C. She took up sculpture in 1863 under the tutelage of Clark Mills, who was then finishing the bronze Liberty sculpture for the Capitol dome. Ream received recognition for her busts of several congressmen and other prominent persons, which led in 1864 to an offer from Congress for her to sculpt a bust of President Abraham Lincoln from life. The success of this work prompted Congress in 1866 to commission from Ream a full-size marble statue of Lincoln for the Capitol rotunda. Then a virtually untrained 18-year-old, Ream was the first woman to win such a commission from the federal government. She completed a plaster model for the statue in her studio and then, accompanied by her parents, took it to Rome in 1869 to translate it into marble.
