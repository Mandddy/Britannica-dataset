Seafloor spreading hypothesis, theory that oceanic crust forms along submarine mountain zones, known collectively as the mid-ocean ridge system, and spreads out laterally away from them. This idea played a pivotal role in the development of plate tectonics, a theory that revolutionized geologic thought during the last quarter of the 20th century.
The seafloor spreading hypothesis was proposed by the American geophysicist Harry H. Hess in 1960. On the basis of new discoveries about the deep-ocean floor, Hess postulated that molten material from the Earth’s mantle continuously wells up along the crests of the mid-ocean ridges that wind for nearly 80,000 km (50,000 miles) through all the world’s oceans. As the magma cools, it is pushed away from the flanks of the ridges. This spreading creates a successively younger ocean floor, and the flow of material is thought to bring about the migration, or drifting apart, of the continents. The continents bordering the Atlantic Ocean, for example, are believed to be moving away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge at a rate of 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 inch) per year, thus increasing the breadth of the ocean basin by twice that amount. Wherever continents are bordered by deep-sea trench systems, as in the Pacific Ocean, the ocean floor is plunged downward, underthrusting the continents and ultimately reentering and dissolving in the Earth’s mantle from which it originated.
