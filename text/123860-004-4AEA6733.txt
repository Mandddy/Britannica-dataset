Blizzard, severe weather condition that is distinguished by low temperatures, strong winds, and large quantities of either falling or blowing snow. The National Weather Service of the United States defines a blizzard as a storm with winds of more than 56 km (35 miles) per hour for at least three hours and enough snow to limit visibility to 0.4 km (0.25 mile) or less. A severe blizzard has winds of over 72 km (45 miles) per hour, visibility near zero, and temperatures of −12 °C (10 °F) or lower. A ground blizzard occurs when there is no falling snow, but snow is drifting and blowing near the ground.
The name originated in the central United States, where blizzards are brought by northwesterly winds following winter depressions, or low-pressure systems. In the United States and in England, the term is often used for any strong, heavy snowstorm with wind. In Antarctica, blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 160 km (about 100 miles) per hour.
