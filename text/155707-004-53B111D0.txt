Michelle Williams, in full Michelle Ingrid Williams  (born September 9, 1980, Kalispell, Montana, U.S.) American actress known for her delicate beauty and for the emotional depth she brought to vulnerable characters.
Williams spent her early childhood in Montana, where her mother was a homemaker and her father a financial trader and author. After moving with her family to San Diego, she began acting in community theatre productions, and in her early teens she made her screen debut in Lassie (1994), a film based on the long-running family-oriented television show. At age 15, having earned a GED at home, Williams became legally emancipated from her parents in order to pursue her acting career without being restricted by child labour laws. Not long after, she was cast as the rebellious outsider Jen Lindley on the teen soap opera Dawson’s Creek (1998–2003). The popular series provided a breakthrough for Williams, and she earned praise for the maturity of her portrayal.
