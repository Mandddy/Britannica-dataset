Flea beetle, any member of the insect subfamily Alticinae (Halticinae) belonging to the leaf beetle family Chrysomelidae (order Coleoptera). These tiny beetles, worldwide in distribution, are usually less than 6 mm (0.25 inch) in length and dark or metallic in colour. The enlarged hindlegs are adapted for jumping. Flea beetles are important pests of cultivated plants: the adults feed on the leaves and the larvae on the roots. Some flea beetles carry plant diseases (e.g., early potato blight).
The grape flea beetle (Altica chalybea), 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.2 inch) long and dark steel-blue in colour, eats grape buds in early spring; both the adults and larvae feed on grape leaves in the summer. They can be controlled by spraying an arsenical poison on the grape leaves.
