Johann Anton Leisewitz,  (born May 9, 1752, Hannover, Hanover [Germany]—died  Sept. 10, 1806, Braunschweig, Brunswick) German dramatist whose most important work, Julius von Tarent (1776), was the forerunner of Friedrich Schiller’s famous Sturm und Drang masterpiece Die Räuber (1781; The Robbers).
Leisewitz studied law at the University of Göttingen from 1770 and joined the Göttinger Hain group in 1774. He entered the Brunswick administrative service, in which he rose to high position. His tragedy Julius von Tarent shows Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s influence. The play, treating the favourite Sturm und Drang theme of fratricide, postulated a fundamental conflict between the political state and the individual heart. It exhibits calculated restraint and finely drawn characters. Leisewitz’s short dramatic sketches Die Pfändung (1775; “The Distraint”) and Der Besuch um Mitternacht (1775; “The Midnight Visit”) pursue the Sturm und Drang trend toward the theme of social injustice, which he had divorced from the tragic conflict in Julius von Tarent.
