Candytuft (genus Iberis), genus of about 40 species of Eurasian plants of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Candytufts are generally herbaceous annuals or perennials, and most species are native to the Mediterranean region. Many are grown as ornamentals for their showy flowers.
Globe candytuft (Iberis umbellata) is a common garden annual that bears flat clusters of pink, violet, white, purple, or red flowers in late summer. The plants are 40 cm (16 inches) tall and have long, narrow leaves. Rocket candytuft (I. amara) has thick, deeply lobed leaves and large white, often pink-tinged, fragrant flowers on 22-cm (9-inch) stalks. It grows on chalky hills and in fields. The evergreen candytuft (I. sempervirens) is a matting perennial with white flowers and is widely planted in gardens.
