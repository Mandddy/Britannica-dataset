Arawana,  (species Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), freshwater fish of tropical South America in the family Osteoglossidae (order Osteoglossiformes). Arawanas seldom reach lengths of more than 60 cm (2 feet) but are regarded as superb sports fish and highly edible. In appearance they have large scales and long dorsal and anal fins that almost join with the tail fin. The lower jaw angles upward to a point above the eyes, and two long, filamentous barbels extend forward from the chin. Arawanas are believed to be mouth brooders, the female carrying the eggs in her mouth until they hatch.
