George M. Pullman, in full George Mortimer Pullman  (born March 3, 1831, Brocton, New York, U.S.—died October 19, 1897, Chicago) American industrialist and inventor of the Pullman sleeping car, a luxurious railroad coach designed for overnight travel. In 1894 workers at his Pullman’s Palace Car Company initiated the Pullman Strike, which severely disrupted rail travel in the midwestern United States and established the use of the injunction as a means of strikebreaking.
Pullman was the third of 10 children born to James and Emily Pullman. The family relocated to Albion, New York, in 1845 so that Pullman’s father, a carpenter, could work on the Erie Canal. His specialty was moving structures out of the way of the canal with jackscrews and a device he patented in 1841. When he died in 1853, George Pullman took over the business, winning a contract with the state of New York the following year to move some 20 buildings from the path of the Erie Canal.
