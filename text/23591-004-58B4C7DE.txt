Arithmometer, early calculating machine, built in 1820 by Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar of France. Whereas earlier calculating machines, such as Blaise Pascal’s Pascaline in France and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz’s Step Reckoner in Germany, were mere curiosities, with the Industrial Revolution came a widespread need to perform repetitive operations efficiently. With other activities being mechanized, why not calculation? De Colmar effectively met this challenge when he built his Arithmometer, the first commercial mass-produced calculating device. Based on Leibniz’s technology, it could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and, with some more elaborate user involvement, division. It was extremely popular and sold for 90 years. In contrast to the modern calculator’s credit-card size, the Arithmometer was large enough to cover a desktop.
