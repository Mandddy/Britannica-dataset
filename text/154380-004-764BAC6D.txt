Alain Mabanckou,  (born February 24, 1966, Mouyondzi, Congo [now Republic of the Congo]) prolific Francophone Congolese poet and novelist whose wordplay, philosophical bent, and sometimes sly and often absurd sense of humour resulted in his being known in France as “the African Samuel Beckett.”
Mabanckou grew up in the port city of Pointe-Noire, the only child of a mother who could not read and a father unfamiliar with fiction. By his own account, he spoke several African languages—Bembé, Laari, Vili, Kamba, Munukutuba (Kituba), and Lingala—before starting school at age six. There he learned French, and it began to dawn on him how much was lost to posterity with the use of unwritten languages and the disappearance of the rituals that served an oral tradition. He studied letters and philosophy at the Lycée Karl Marx in Pointe-Noire (B.A., 1981) and then began prelaw classes in Brazzaville. At age 22 he won a scholarship to study law in Paris, and he took an advanced degree in business law from the University of Paris-Dauphine in 1993. Even before leaving Congo, Mabanckou had written a number of manuscripts, and he began to publish these while working for the Paris-based multinational firm Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux. The first of his writings to see publication was a book of poems, Au jour le jour (1993; “Day to Day”), as were the second and third. His first novel, Bleu-blanc-rouge (1998; Blue White Red), concerns the discoveries of an African immigrant to France. When this work won the Association of French-Language Writers’ Literary Grand Prize of Black Africa, Mabanckou’s course seemed set.
