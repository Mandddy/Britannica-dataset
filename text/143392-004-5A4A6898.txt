Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), the academic and spiritual centre of Conservative Judaism in the United States. Founded in New York City in 1886 as the Jewish Theological Seminary Association, the institution was first headed by Rabbi Sabato Morais, whose declared goal was to educate rabbis in modern research.
The school name was modified and its charter revised in 1902 under the seminaryâ€™s second president, Solomon Schechter, whose reputation for outstanding scholarship attracted other distinguished scholars to the faculty. Since that time the seminary has grown steadily, and its present library holdings are considered to be one of the finest collections of Hebraica in the world.
