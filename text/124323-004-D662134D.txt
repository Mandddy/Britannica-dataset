Melissa Etheridge, in full Melissa Lou Etheridge  (born May 29, 1961, Leavenworth, Kan., U.S.) American musician known for her raspy-voiced rock-and-roll singing. She also was noted for her openness about her sexual orientation.
Etheridge began playing the guitar at age 8 and writing songs by age 11. She honed her skills playing in local bands throughout her teens (emulating influences such as Bruce Springsteen and Pete Townshend of the Who) and briefly attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston before returning to Kansas. On her 21st birthday, Etheridge left home for Los Angeles, where she played in clubs and bars until 1986, when Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, signed her to a recording contract. Her first album, Melissa Etheridge (1988), with its hit single “Bring Me Some Water,” earned her a Grammy Award nomination. Success continued with the release of Brave and Crazy (1989) and Never Enough (1992), which garnered a Grammy for the single “Ain’t It Heavy.”
