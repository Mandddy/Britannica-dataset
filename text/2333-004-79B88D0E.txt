Glenn L. Martin,  (born Jan. 17, 1886, Macksburg, Iowa, U.S.—died  Dec. 4, 1955, Baltimore, Md.) American airplane inventor whose bombers and flying boats played important roles in World War II.
In Santa Ana, Calif., before World War I, Martin designed his first powered airplane and leased an abandoned church as his first factory. He became one of the outstanding barnstorming flyers (from about 1910 to 1914) and used his experience to develop several successful types of military aircraft. The first Martin bomber, designated the MB, appeared in 1918–19, too late for active use in World War I, but its success in the hands of Colonel “Billy” Mitchell established Martin as one of the leading military airplane manufacturers of the United States. He built a factory in Cleveland and in 1929 moved his manufacturing facilities to Middle River, Md., near Baltimore. Toward the end of his life Martin took great interest in civic affairs, education (he gave large sums to the engineering school of the University of Maryland), and wildlife conservation.
