John Cotton,  (born Dec. 4, 1585, Derby, Derbyshire, Eng.—died  Dec. 23, 1652, Boston, Mass. [U.S.]) influential New England Puritan leader who served principally as “teacher” of the First Church of Boston (1633–52) after escaping the persecution of Nonconformists by the Church of England.
Educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, Cotton became vicar of the parish church of St. Botolph’s in Boston, Lincolnshire, in 1612 and remained in that post for 21 years. During this time he gradually became more Puritan in his outlook, and he ceased to observe certain Anglican religious rituals in his performance of his duties. In 1632 legal action was taken against him for his Nonconformism, and in July 1633 he emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where he became “teacher” of the First Church of Boston, remaining so until his death. His popularity in the colony was unbounded, and his influence in both civil and ecclesiastical affairs was probably greater than that of any other minister in theocratic New England.
