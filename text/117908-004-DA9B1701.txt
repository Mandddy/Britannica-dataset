Natural Bridges National Monument, scenic area in southeastern Utah, U.S., containing three natural sandstone bridges. The bridges were carved by two winding streams that formed on the western slopes of Elk Ridge, a formation of the northwestern Colorado Plateau. Established in 1908, the monument lies 42 miles (68 km) west of Blanding and occupies a 12-square-mile (31-square-km) site.
The largest bridge, Sipapu, rises 220 feet (67 metres) above the streambed and has a span of 268 feet (82 metres). The Kachina and Owachomo bridges are, respectively, 210 and 106 feet (64 and 32 metres) high with spans of 204 and 180 feet (62 and 55 metres). There are many Native American ruins in the vicinity, and pictographs are found on the abutments of Kachina, carved by early Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) cliff dwellers. Pi√±on pine and juniper forests are the common vegetation in the vicinity.
