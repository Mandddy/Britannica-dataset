Lågen, also called Gudbrandsdalslågen,  river, south-central Norway. The name Lågen is applied to the portion of the river in Oppland fylke (county); it rises in small lakes and streams in the Dovre Plateau at the northern end of Gudbrands Valley and flows southeast for 122 miles (199 km) through Gudbrands Valley to Lake Mjøsa at Lillehammer. It flows out from Mjøsa as the Vorma River (in Akershus fylke) southeast to its confluence with the Glomma (Glåma) River at Årnes, more than 100 miles (160 km) from its source. It drains an area of about 4,600 square miles (11,900 square km) through its main tributaries—the Otta, Sjoa, Vinstra, and Gausa rivers. Large hydroelectric power-generating stations have been built along the Lågen. The main road and rail routes between Trondheim and Oslo follow the river for most of its length.
