Donald Sutherland, in full Donald McNichol Sutherland  (born July 17, 1935, Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada) Canadian character actor who was equally adept at portraying heinous villains and benevolent family patriarchs.
After graduating with dual degrees in engineering and drama from the University of Toronto, Sutherland embarked on a career on the London stage. He later appeared on such television series as The Saint, Court Martial, and The Avengers before capturing attention on the big screen with his role as the dim-witted Vernon Pinkley in The Dirty Dozen (1967). His breakout role, however, was Hawkeye Pierce, the lanky wisecracking and insubordinate surgeon in the satirical war classic M*A*S*H (1970). Another war film followed, the comedic Kelly’s Heroes (1970). In the taut Klute (1971) and Don’t Look Now (1973), he played characters who develop obsessive streaks while investigating the disappearance of a friend and the death of a daughter, respectively. Sutherland portrayed a murderous fascist leader in the critically acclaimed Italian epic 1900 (1976) and a Nazi spy in the thriller Eye of the Needle (1981). Another classic dramatic role for Sutherland was as the tormented father in the Academy Award-winning film Ordinary People (1980). He played other paternal or avuncular film roles in A Dry White Season (1989), Cold Mountain (2003), The Italian Job (2003), Pride &amp; Prejudice (2005; as the estimable Mr. Bennet), The Mechanic (2011), and The Eagle (2011).
