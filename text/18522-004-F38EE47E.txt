Science Museum, museum that is the headquarters of Britain’s National Museum of Science and Industry and is one of the greatest museums of science and technology in the world. It is located in South Kensington, London, near the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.
The Science Museum had its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851, some exhibits of which led to the creation of a Museum of Manufactures and, in due course, to the South Kensington Museum. This museum, which opened in 1857, covered both science and art, and it was not until 1909 that the two sections were formally separated. (The arts section went on to form the core of the Victoria and Albert Museum.) The Science Museum’s present quarters, designed by Sir Richard Allison, were opened to the public in stages over the period 1919–28; from then until 1961 there were a number of extensions. The museum’s Wellcome Wing (opened 2000), which contains an IMAX theatre, is devoted to contemporary and future science.
