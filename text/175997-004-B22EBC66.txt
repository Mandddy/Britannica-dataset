12 Angry Men, American courtroom film drama, released in 1957, considered a classic of the genre. It marked the feature-film directorial debut of Sidney Lumet.
The film was adapted from a 1954 television play that aired on the series Studio One. It centres on the deliberations of 12 jurors serving on a murder case. Eleven jurors vote for a quick conviction, but one holdout (played by Henry Fonda) painstakingly tries to convince the others that the accused may be innocent, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
