Āghā Moḥammad Khān,  (born 1742, Gorgān, Iran—died 1797, near Shusha) founder and first ruler of the Qājār dynasty of Iran. Following the disintegration of the Ṣafavid empire in 1722, Qājār tribal chieftains became prominent in Iranian affairs.
At the age of six Āghā Moḥammad was castrated on the orders of ʿĀdil Shāh to prevent him from becoming a political rival, but this disability did not hinder his career. In 1757 he became the de facto governor of the Azerbaijan province of northern Iran; the next year he succeeded his father as chief of the Qavānlū clan of the Qājārs. In 1762 he was captured by a rival chieftain and sent as a prisoner to Shīrāz, where he spent the next 16 years as a political hostage. In 1779 Āghā Moḥammad escaped and fled to Astarābād, the centre of Qavānlū authority. By 1786, when Tehrān was made the capital, he was the dominant political figure in northern Iran.
