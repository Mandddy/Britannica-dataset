Francesco Laurana, original name Francesco de la Vrana  (born c. 1430, Vrana, Dalmatia, republic of Venice [now Croatia]—died before March 12, 1502, Avignon, France) early Italian Renaissance sculptor and medalist, especially distinguished for his severely elegant portrait busts of women and as an early disseminator of the Renaissance style in France.
Laurana’s early career is obscure, the first notice of him, in 1453, being when he was paid by Alfonso II of Aragon for work on the triumphal arch of the Castel Nuovo in Naples. Between 1461 and 1466 he was at the court of René, duke d’Anjou, rival claimant to the throne of Naples. By 1468, however, Laurana was in Sicily, and he seems to have spent the remainder of his life there, at Naples, and in the south of France.
