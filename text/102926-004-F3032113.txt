Mount Rainier National Park, scenic area of the Cascade Range in west-central Washington, U.S., about 35 miles (56 km) southeast of Tacoma and some 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. The park was created in 1899 to preserve Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano 14,410 feet (4,392 metres) high, and the surrounding area. It covers 369 square miles (957 square km).
The peak of Mount Rainier was sculpted by ice, and some two dozen named glaciers and a number of smaller patches of permanent ice and snow remain around the summit area. The largest of these is Emmons Glacier along the northeast face. The park’s climate is cool montane, with warm summers and cold winters; elevation considerably affects temperatures. The park region receives large quantities of precipitation annually, especially on the western slope of Mount Rainier. Much of this falls as snow in winter and at higher elevations; snow can occur at any time of year in the summit area. Winter snowfall totals are substantial on the mountain: the ranger station at the Paradise area, on the southern slope, has recorded some of the world’s highest annual totals, which occasionally exceed 80 feet (24 metres).
