Andō Tadao,  (born September 13, 1941, Ōsaka, Japan) one of Japan’s leading contemporary architects. He is best known for his minimalist concrete buildings.
Andō had various careers, including professional boxer, before he became a self-taught architect and opened his own practice in Ōsaka in 1969. In the 1970s and ’80s, he executed a series of mostly small-scale, often residential buildings in Japan such as the Azuma House (1975–76) in Ōsaka and the Koshino House (1979–81) in Ashiya. In these early commissions, he used beautifully detailed reinforced concrete walls, a form that gave his buildings a massive, minimalist appearance and simple, contemplative interior spaces. These works established the aesthetic Andō would continue throughout his career: essentially Modernist, coming out of the tradition of Le Corbusier’s experiments with concrete, his work is also rooted in the spirituality of Japanese architectural space. Andō’s structures were often in harmony with their natural environments, taking advantage of natural light in a dramatically expressive way. In his Church of Light (1989–90) in the Ōsaka suburb of Ibaraki, for example, a cruciform shape is cut out of the concrete wall behind the altar; when daylight hits the outside of this wall, a cross of light is generated within the interior.
