Virgil Thomson,  (born Nov. 25, 1896, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.â€”died  Sept. 30, 1989, New York, N.Y.) American composer, conductor, and music critic whose forward-looking ideas stimulated new lines of thought among contemporary musicians.
Thomson studied at Harvard University and later in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, a noted teacher of musical composition. There he was influenced by early 20th-century French composers, especially the group known as Les Six, whose most prominent members were Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger, and Francis Poulenc. Thomson wrote in a variety of styles, including Gregorian chant, variations on Baptist hymns, and neoclassicism, often combining traditional forms with contemporary techniques, marked by careful craftsmanship. The greatest influence on him was that of Erik Satie, and it found expression in clarity, simplicity, and humour.
