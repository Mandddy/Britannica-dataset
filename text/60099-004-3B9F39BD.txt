Hawk moth (family Sphingidae), also called sphinx moth or hummingbird moth,  any of a group of sleek-looking moths (order Lepidoptera) that are named for their hovering, swift flight patterns. These moths have stout bullet-shaped bodies with long, narrow forewings and shorter hindwings. Wingspans range from 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 inches). Many species pollinate flowers such as orchids and petunias while sucking nectar. The proboscis (feeding organ) of some species measures up to 32.5 cm (13 inches). Some hawk moths migrate.
The common name for Acherontia atropos, deathâ€™s head moth, derives from the fancied facsimile of a human skull on the upper surface of the body. Common in Europe and Africa, these moths have a short proboscis and often feed on honey from beehives. They produce loud chirping or squeaking sounds by forcing air out through the proboscis. In the larval stage they make distinct cracking noises.
