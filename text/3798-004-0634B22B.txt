O. E. Rölvaag,  (born April 22, 1876, Dönna Island, Helgeland, Nor.—died  Nov. 5, 1931, Northfield, Minn., U.S.) Norwegian-American novelist and educator noted for his realistic portrayals of Norwegian settlers on the Dakota prairies and of the clash between transplanted and native cultures in the United States.
Rölvaag immigrated to the United States in 1896 and was naturalized in 1908. Educated at St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minn., and the University of Oslo, Norway, he spent most of his life at St. Olaf as a teacher of Norwegian language and literature and the history of Norwegian immigration. He wrote in Norwegian, the language in which his works were originally published, and worked closely with the translators of the English versions.
