Senufo, also spelled Senoufo ,  a group of closely related peoples of northern Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and southeastern Mali. They speak at least four distinct languages (Palaka, Dyimini, and Senari in Côte d’Ivoire and Suppire in Mali), which belong to the Gur branch of the Niger-Congo language family. Within each group, numerous subdivisions use their own names for the people and language; the name Senufo is of external origin. Palaka separated from the main Senufo stock well before the 14th century ad; at about that time, with the founding of the town of Kong as a Bambara trade-route station, the rest of the population began migrations to the south, west, and north, resulting in the present divisions.
Senufo peoples are agricultural, their major crops including corn (maize) and millet. Their farms cluster around villages of small mud-brick houses, thatched in the south but with flat roofs in the drier north. The domestic unit is the extended family: a patriarch, with his sons and their wives and children. Marriage is by parental arrangement; polygyny is fairly common. Inheritance and succession are matrilineal. Initiation rites for adolescents are the introduction to adult tribal responsibilities.
