Canoeing, the use for sport, recreation, or competition of a canoe, kayak, or foldboat, all small, narrow, lightweight boats propelled by paddles and pointed at both ends. There are many canoe clubs in Europe and North America, and most canoes are used in touring or cruising, travel in wilderness areas, or wild-water sport, the thrilling and dangerous sport of canoeing in rapids or surf.
In the 1860s John MacGregor, a Scottish lawyer, sportsman, traveler, and philanthropist, was a major figure in the development of canoeing as recreation and sport. He designed sailing canoes, which were decked and provided with a mast and sail as well as paddles, traveled in them throughout Europe and in the Middle East, and promoted their use in lectures and books. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, designed a series of canoes with sails in the 1870s, and thereafter his and MacGregorâ€™s canoes followed a separate course of development from the paddled canoe. A type of decked sailing canoe was recognized by the International Canoe Federation (ICF) after World War II, and in 1970 the sail canoe became a one-design class (a racing division in which all boats are built to the same measurements) in yachting.
