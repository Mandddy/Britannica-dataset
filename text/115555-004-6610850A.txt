József Katona,  (born Nov. 11, 1791, Kecskemét, Hung., Austrian Habsburg domain [now in Hungary]—died  April 16, 1830, Kecskemét) Hungarian lawyer and playwright whose historical tragedy Bánk bán achieved its great reputation only after his death.
A lawyer, Katona was also interested in the stage and wrote several plays of little literary merit. In 1815 he wrote Bánk bán, which, though he entered it for a literary prize and in 1820 had it printed, remained unnoticed until the mid-1830s. Disappointed by his failure to achieve literary success, Katona turned to law and spent his last years as attorney general of his native town.
