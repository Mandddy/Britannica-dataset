Domenico Beccafumi, also called Domenico di Pace  (born c. 1486, Montaperti, Siena, Republic of Siena—died  May 1551, Siena) Italian painter and sculptor, a leader in the post-Renaissance style known as Mannerism.
Beccafumi was the son of a peasant named Giacomo di Pace. He adopted the name of his patron Lorenzo Beccafumi, the owner of the land on which the family lived. About 1510 he went to Rome to study the work of Raphael and Michelangelo. Returning in 1512 to Siena, Beccafumi and the painter Sodoma decorated the facade of the Palazzo Borghese. In 1517 he was in charge of the painters at the church of San Bernardino and from 1518 to 1546 contributed many fine designs to the commesso (white marble inlay with subjects outlined in black) in the pavement of Siena cathedral. These rich, colourful scenes from the Old Testament impressed Charles I of England, who tried unsuccessfully to purchase the original drawings. In 1541, Prince Doria called Beccafumi to Genoa, where he created the fresco “Episode in the Life of Medea and Jason,” now lost. Returning to Siena, he executed and cast the bronze angels (c. 1548) of the cathedral. The illuminism, or “chromatic lyricism,” that he achieved on the ceiling of the Palazzo Bindi Sergardi and in the Pinacoteca of Siena added to his reputation. His “Birth of the Virgin” and “The Expulsion of the Rebel Angels” in the latter show the typical elongated and foreshortened forms employed by the Mannerists. But his work contained many diverging tendencies, producing an overall unevenness.
