Akari, also called Astro-F,  Japanese satellite observatory that carried a 67-cm (26-inch) near- to far-infrared telescope. On February 22, 2006, Akari (“Light” in Japanese) was launched from the Uchinoura Space Center in Japan. Its mission was to produce an infrared map of the entire sky that would improve on the map made by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) nearly 25 years earlier. In making its all-sky map, Akari detected three times as many sources as IRAS had. To observe in the far-infrared, the telescope needed to be cooled by liquid helium, and the spacecraft carried a supply that lasted until August 26, 2007. Akari continued working in the near-infrared, but a fault in its electrical system ended observations in June 2011. Its transmitters were switched off on November 24, 2011.
