John Hope Franklin,  (born Jan. 2, 1915, Rentiesville, Okla., U.S.—died March 25, 2009, Durham, N.C.) American historian and educator noted for his scholarly reappraisal of the American Civil War era and the importance of the black struggle in shaping modern American identity.

(1947–56), Brooklyn (N.Y.) College (1956–64), the University of Chicago (1964–82; emeritus thereafter), and Duke University, Durham, N.C. (1982–92).
