Mishima Yukio, pseudonym of Hiraoka Kimitake   (born Jan. 14, 1925, Tokyo—died  Nov. 25, 1970, Tokyo) prolific writer who is regarded by many critics as the most important Japanese novelist of the 20th century.
Mishima was the son of a high civil servant and attended the aristocratic Peers School in Tokyo. During World War II, having failed to qualify physically for military service, he worked in a Tokyo factory and after the war studied law at the University of Tokyo. In 1948–49 he worked in the banking division of the Japanese Ministry of Finance. His first novel, Kamen no kokuhaku (1949; Confessions of a Mask), is a partly autobiographical work that describes with exceptional stylistic brilliance a homosexual who must mask his abnormal sexual preferences from the society around him. The novel gained Mishima immediate acclaim, and he began to devote his full energies to writing.
