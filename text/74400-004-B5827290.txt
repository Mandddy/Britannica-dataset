Rock edicts, narrative histories and announcements carved into cliff rock, onto pillars, and in caves throughout India by King Ashoka (reigned c. 265–238 bce), the most powerful emperor of the Mauryan dynasty and a highly influential promulgator of Indian Buddhism. Ashoka’s first years as king were marked by his brutal slaughter of thousands of people during the conquest of Kalinga. After being exposed to the moral teachings (dharma) of Buddhism—teachings based on the necessity for nonviolence and compassion—Ashoka was moved to deep remorse for his actions. He converted to Buddhism, and, as a record of his understanding of moral law, he carved lessons into stone in the hope that he could provide inspiration and guidance to the people of his extensive kingdom. The rock edicts are important sources for modern understanding of ancient Indian political and religious history, particularly with regard to the influence of the Buddha’s teachings on the king and, through him, on the people at large.
