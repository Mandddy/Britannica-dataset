Royal Botanic Gardens,  state-supported botanical garden in Sydney, Australia. Officially established in 1816, it is the oldest such garden in the country. It is also the most spectacularly sited, occupying more than 27 hectares (66 acres) along the shores of Sydney Harbour. The garden has about 5,000 kinds of plants under cultivation. Much emphasis has been placed on planting the native species of Australia, particularly the woody ones, and hence, its collections of Australian trees are extensive. Many exotic varieties, however, have also been planted. Other specialties are palms, cycads, ferns, and orchids. The National Herbarium of New South Wales, situated at the garden, contains approximately one million reference specimens. Although the herbarium has worldwide representation, it specializes in the plants of New South Wales and other areas of Australia. Its principal publication is Telopea, formerly entitled Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium.
