Ernst Bloch,  (born July 8, 1885, Ludwigshafen, Ger.—died  Aug. 4, 1977, Stuttgart) German Marxist philosopher whose Philosophie der Hoffnung (“Philosophy of Hope”) was intended to complete what he considered Marxism’s partial outlook on reality.
Having begun his career at the University of Leipzig (1918), Bloch fled from Nazi Germany to Switzerland (1933), then went to the United States, where he wrote the first two volumes of his major work, Das Prinzip Hoffnung, 3 vol. (1954–59; “The Hope Principle”). He returned to the University of Leipzig in 1948. He had, however, become critical of the development of Marxist thought and provoked the disapproval of the ruling Communist Party officials; the journal Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie, which he edited from 1953, was suppressed, he was forbidden to publish, and in 1957 his works were condemned. In 1961 he defected to West Germany and taught at the University of Tübingen.
