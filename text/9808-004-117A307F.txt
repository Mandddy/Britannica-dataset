Isamu Noguchi,  (born November 17, 1904, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died  December 30, 1988, New York, New York) American sculptor and designer, one of the strongest advocates of the expressive power of organic abstract shapes in 20th-century American sculpture.
Noguchi spent his early years in Japan, and, after studying in New York City with Onorio Ruotolo in 1923, he won a Guggenheim fellowship and became Constantin Brancusi’s assistant for two years (1927–29) in Paris. There he met Alberto Giacometti and Alexander Calder and became an enthusiast of abstract sculpture. He was also influenced by the Surrealist works of Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró. Noguchi’s first exhibition was in New York City in 1929.
