Levi Woodbury,  (born December 22, 1789, Francestown, New Hampshire, U.S.—died September 4, 1851, Portsmouth, New Hampshire) American politician who was an associate justice of the Supreme Court from 1846 to 1851.
Woodbury graduated from Dartmouth College in 1809, and after studying law he was admitted to the bar in 1812. He thereafter served as an associate justice of the New Hampshire Superior Court (1817–23), was governor of New Hampshire (1823–25), and sat in the U.S. Senate from 1825 to 1831. He served as secretary of the navy from 1831 to 1834 and was appointed secretary of the treasury in 1834. In this post he assisted Pres. Andrew Jackson in the latter’s opposition to the rechartering of the Bank of the United States. During the Panic of 1837 Woodbury was able to maintain the credit of the federal government and benefited many state banks by doing so. He headed the treasury until he left the cabinet in 1841, upon which he was reelected to the Senate.
