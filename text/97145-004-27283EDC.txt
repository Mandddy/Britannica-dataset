Warren E. Burger, in full Warren Earl Burger   (born Sept. 17, 1907, St. Paul, Minn., U.S.—died  June 25, 1995, Washington, D.C.) 15th chief justice of the United States (1969–86).
After graduating with honours from St. Paul (now William Mitchell) College of Law in 1931, Burger joined a prominent St. Paul law firm and gradually became active in Republican Party politics. In 1953 he was appointed an assistant U.S. attorney general, and in 1955 he was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Burger’s generally conservative approach during his 13-year service (1956–69) on the nation’s second highest court commended him to President Richard M. Nixon, who in 1969 named Burger to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice of the Supreme Court. He was quickly confirmed and in June 1969 was sworn in as the nation’s chief justice.
