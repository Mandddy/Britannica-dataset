Neptune, third most massive planet of the solar system and the eighth and outermost planet from the Sun. Because of its great distance from Earth, it cannot be seen with the unaided eye. With a small telescope, it appears as a tiny, faint blue-green disk. It is designated by the symbol ♆.
Neptune is named for the Roman god of the sea, who is identified with the Greek deity Poseidon, a son of the Titan Cronus (the Roman god Saturn) and a brother of Zeus (the Roman god Jupiter). It is the second planet to have been found by means of a telescope. Its discovery in 1846 was a remarkable combination of the application of solid Newtonian physics and a belief in a numerological scheme that later proved to be scientifically unfounded (see below Neptune’s discovery). Neptune’s orbit is almost perfectly circular; as a result, its distance from the Sun varies comparatively little over its nearly 164-year period of revolution. Although the dwarf planet Pluto’s mean distance from the Sun is greater than Neptune’s, its orbit is so eccentric (elongated) that for about 20 years of each revolution Pluto is actually nearer the Sun than is Neptune.Planetary data for Neptune      mean distance from Sun 4,498,396,000 km (30.1 AU)   eccentricity of orbit 0.0086   inclination of orbit to ecliptic 1.77°   Neptunian year (sidereal period of revolution) 164.79 Earth years   visual magnitude at mean opposition 7.8   mean synodic period* 367.49 Earth days   mean orbital velocity 5.43 km/sec   equatorial radius** 24,764 km   polar radius** 24,340 km   mass 1.02 x 1026 kg   mean density 1.64 g/cm3   gravity** 1,115 cm/sec2   escape velocity** 23.6 km/sec   rotation period (magnetic field) 16 hr 7 min   inclination of equator to orbit 28.3°   magnetic field strength at equator (mean) 0.14 gauss   tilt angle of magnetic axis 46.8°   offset of magnetic axis 0.55 of Neptune’s radius   number of known moons 13   planetary ring system 6 rings, 1 containing several arcs   *Time required for the planet to return to the same position in the sky relative to the Sun as seen from Earth. **Calculated for the altitude at which 1 bar of atmospheric pressure is exerted.
