Guggenheim Collection, in full Peggy Guggenheim Collection,  in Venice, private collection of post-1910 paintings and sculpture formed by the American art collector Peggy Guggenheim and housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni on the Grand Canal, her former home. It is considered to be one of the best collections of post-1910 modern art in Europe.
The entry hall contains a mobile by Alexander Calder. The dining room displays early Cubist works by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. Modern sculpture is displayed on the terrace toward the Grand Canal, and the collection includes works by Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, and Marino Marini. Examples of postwar American and European art include works by Jackson Pollock, Francis Bacon, and Mark Rothko. A separate wing in the garden, the “Barchessa,” contains Surrealist works by Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, René Magritte, Giorgio De Chirico, and others. The collection is directed by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation of New York City.
