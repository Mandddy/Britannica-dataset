Lingam, (
        Sanskrit: “sign” or “distinguishing symbol”) also spelled linga,  in Hinduism, a votary object that symbolizes the god Shiva and is revered as an emblem of generative power. The lingam appears in Shaivite temples and in private shrines throughout India.
In Shaivite temples the lingam is often at the centre, surrounded by murtis (sacred images of deities). In contrast to the latter, the lingam is distinctively aniconic. It is a smooth cylindrical mass. Often it rests in the centre of a lipped, disk-shaped object, the yoni, which is an emblem of the goddess Shakti. Ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas relate narratives that identify the lingam as the phallus of Shiva. Practicing Hindus consider the lingam and yoni together to symbolize the union of the male and female principles and the totality of all existence.
