Matteo Bandello,  (born 1485, Castelnuovo Scrivia, duchy of Milan [Italy]—died  1561, Agen, France) Italian writer whose Novelle (stories) started a new trend in 16th-century narrative literature and had a wide influence in England, France, and Spain.
A monk, diplomat, and soldier as well as a writer, Bandello was educated at Milan and the University of Pavia. He frequented the courts of Ferrara and Mantua and knew Niccolò Machiavelli. Bandello was entrusted with the education of Lucrezia Gonzaga, to whom he dedicated a long poem. The material for his Novelle was destroyed in the Spanish attack on Milan (1522), and he fled to France. In 1550 he was made bishop of Agen and spent the remainder of his life in France writing the stories on which his reputation rests.
