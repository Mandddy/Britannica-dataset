Mogambo, American adventure film, released in 1953, that featured Clark Gable in a remake of his 1932 adventure film Red Dust.
Victor Marswell (played by Gable) is a big-game hunter on safari with two beautiful women who vie for his attention: former showgirl Eloise Kelly (Ava Gardner) and young bride Linda Nordley (Grace Kelly), who is accompanied on the excursion by her husband, anthropologist Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden). A love triangle develops, and tensions heighten to the point that Linda shoots and wounds Victor when she catches him in Eloiseâ€™s embrace. Eloise, however, tells everyone that Victor had been shot in self-defense in response to his unwanted advances, and Donald never learns the truth about his wife. The feud between the women is thus resolved, with Linda returning to her husband, which leaves Eloise and Victor to unite in the end.
