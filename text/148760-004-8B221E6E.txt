River Wensum, river that rises in the county of Norfolk, England, to the west of the village of Fakenham and then flows southeast for 30 miles (50 km) toward the city of Norwich and the River Yare, of which it is a major tributary. In its upper reaches it flows through rich farming country, and its lower reaches form part of The Broads, inland waterways in Norfolk and Suffolk of considerable recreational value. The city of Norwich was first founded as the Saxon settlement of Northwic on gravel terraces above the Wensum.
