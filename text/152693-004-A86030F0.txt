Java, modern object-oriented computer programming language.
Java was created at Sun Microsystems, Inc., where cofounder William (Bill) Joy led a team of researchers in an effort to create a new language that would allow consumer electronic devices to communicate with each other. Work on the language began in 1991, and before long the team’s focus changed to a new niche, the World Wide Web. Java was first used on the Web in 1994, and Java’s ability to provide interactivity and multimedia showed that it was particularly well suited for the Web.
