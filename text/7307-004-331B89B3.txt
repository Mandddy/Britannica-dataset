Zhang Guolao, Wade-Giles romanization Chang Kuo-lao, also called  Zhang Guo,  in Chinese religion, one of the Baxian, the Eight Immortals of Daoism. In art he is depicted carrying a phoenix feather and the peach of immortality. He rides (often backward) on a marvelous mule that is capable of being folded like paper when not in use.
Zhang claimed to have been born in prehistoric times. Legends about him, however, seem to have accrued to a historical personality who lived in the 7th century ce and was summoned to the imperial palace by two Tang dynasty emperors. Zhang, much preferring a secluded life to government appointments, refused to go. It is related, nonetheless, that on one occasion Zhang visited the court of Emperor Xuanzong (reigned 712â€“756) to perform feats of magic. In later times his picture adorned nuptial chambers, for he reputedly bestowed children on newly married couples.
