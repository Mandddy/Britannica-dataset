Alice Paul,  (born Jan. 11, 1885, Moorestown, N.J., U.S.—died July 9, 1977, Moorestown) American woman suffrage leader who introduced the first equal rights amendment campaign in the United States.
Paul was reared in a Quaker home. She graduated from Swarthmore College (1905) and pursued postgraduate studies at the New York School of Social Work. She then went to England to do settlement work (1906–09), and during her stay there she was jailed three times for suffragist agitation. She also continued to do postgraduate work at the Universities of Birmingham and London and received degrees from the University of Pennsylvania (M.A., 1907, in absentia; Ph.D., 1912). Returning to the United States, she advocated the use of militant tactics to publicize the need for a federal woman suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1912 she became chairman of the congressional committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association but soon differed with what she considered its timid policies; in 1913 Paul and a group of like-minded militants withdrew to found the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage, which in 1917 merged with the Woman’s Party to form the National Woman’s Party.
