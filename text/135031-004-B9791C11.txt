Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere,  (born April 26, 1868, Hampstead, London, Eng.—died  Nov. 26, 1940, Bermuda) British newspaper proprietor who, with his brother Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe, built the most successful journalistic empire in British history and created popular journalism in that country. A shy individual, he let his brother handle the public and journalistic side of the business, while he handled financial problems with great skill. He was an extremely astute businessman who also gave generously to philanthropies.
Leaving school early, Harmsworth became a tax clerk before joining his brother’s magazine-publishing firm in 1888. In 1894 the brothers bought London’s Evening News, with which they made a great success. Two years later they launched a morning paper, the highly profitable Daily Mail. They took over the Daily Mirror in 1914, adding a popular Sunday Pictorial, the first Sunday picture newspaper to appear in London. Harmsworth papers, which were aimed at large popular audiences, featured short articles in simple, exciting language, much scandal and sensationalism, and many pictures. Though often criticized as vulgar and illiterate, the papers made fortunes for their owners. In 1910 Harmsworth was made a baronet and in 1914 a baron.
