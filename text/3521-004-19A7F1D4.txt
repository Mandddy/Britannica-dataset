Pill bug,  any of the terrestrial crustaceans of the families Armadillididae and Armadillidae (order Isopoda). When disturbed, the pill bug rolls itself up into a tiny ball. Like the related sow bug, it is sometimes called the wood louse. For mollusks also known as pill bugs, see chiton.
The common pill bug Armadillidium vulgare (family Armadillididae) is about 17 millimetres (0.7 inch) long. The gray body, with its platelike segments, somewhat resembles a miniature armadillo, an armoured mammal that also curls into a ball when disturbed. A. vulgare occurs in dry, sunny places, in leaf litter, and on the edges of wooded areas. Originally found in Europe, it now occurs worldwide. A. nasatum, native to northern Europe, has been introduced into North America. Armadillo officinalis (family Armadillidae), which attains lengths of 19 millimetres (0.75 inch), is native to southern Europe.
