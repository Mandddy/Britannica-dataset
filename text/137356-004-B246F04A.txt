Caprimulgidae,  bird family of the order Caprimulgiformes. Birds of this family are commonly called nightjars, from their jarring cries, or goatsuckers, from the ancient superstition that they used their very wide mouths to milk goats. They are insectivorous birds that take flying insects on the wing, usually at night. During the day they sleep on the ground or perched, usually lengthwise, on a branch. They lay one or two eggs, not in nests but usually on the ground or on rooftops. The incubation period is about 19 days.
Nightjars are protectively coloured in gray and brown and are sparrow to pigeon sized. Most of the more than 80 species in this family belong to the subfamily Caprimulginae (true nightjars), almost worldwide in distribution except for New Zealand and some oceanic islands. For examples see nightjar; chuck-willâ€™s-widow; pauraque; poorwill; whippoorwill. Species of the subfamily Chordeilinae (nighthawks) are New World birds (see nighthawk).
