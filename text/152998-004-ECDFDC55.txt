Sidney Poitier,  (born February 20, 1927? see Researcherâ€™s Note, Miami, Florida, U.S.) Bahamian American actor, director, and producer who broke the colour barrier in the U.S. motion-picture industry and made the careers of other black actors possible. He was the first African American to win an Academy Award for best actor (for Lilies of the Field [1963]).
Poitier was born prematurely in the United States while his parents were visiting from The Bahamas. He grew up on Cat Island, Bahamas, and returned as a teenager to the United States, where he enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II and served a brief stint in a medical unit. Upon his discharge, he applied to the American Negro Theatre (ANT) in New York City. Refused a place because of his accent, he practiced American enunciation while listening to the accents of radio voices and reapplied to ANT six months later. This time he was accepted, and he began studying acting while appearing in a series of ANT productions. In 1946 he made his Broadway debut in Lysistrata.
