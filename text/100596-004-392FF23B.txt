Tioga Pass, highest (9,945 feet [3,031 metres]) roadway across the Sierra Nevada, central California, U.S. Originally the pass served the nearby mining district, and it was named about 1878 for the Tioga mine; it now functions as the eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park. Inyo National Forest is east of the pass, and Devils Postpile National Monument lies to the south.
