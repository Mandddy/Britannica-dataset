Video art, form of moving-image art that garnered many practitioners in the 1960s and ’70s with the widespread availability of inexpensive videotape recorders and the ease of its display through commercial television monitors. Video art became a major medium for artists who wished to exploit the near-universal presence of television in modern Western society. Their videotapes, often nonnarrative and of short duration, could be broadcast over public airways or played through videocassette recorders (VCRs).
Early artists working in this medium, such as the Korean-born artist Nam June Paik, created installations of numerous television sets programmed with the artists’ own experimental and sometimes abstract videos, creating sculptures that are internally kinetic. Paik’s TV Bra for Living Sculpture (1969), in which the performance artist and cellist Charlotte Moorman played the cello topless with two small video-playing TV monitors attached to her chest, illustrates video art’s long-standing ties to performance (see also performance art), as well as its often avant-garde nature. Other artists began to experiment with video projection, which enabled them to create more-monumental effects, often viewed on museum and gallery walls.
