Hans Werner Henze,  (born July 1, 1926, Gütersloh, Germany—died October 27, 2012, Dresden) German composer whose operas, ballets, symphonies, and other works are marked by an individual and advanced style wrought within traditional forms.
Henze was a pupil of the noted German composer Wolfgang Fortner and of René Leibowitz, the leading French composer of 12-tone music. One of Henze’s early works, the Violin Concerto No. 1 (1947), demonstrated his mastery of 12-tone technique, which dominated his writing until 1956. Henze considered his early works, up to his Symphony No. 2 (1949), to be simple, or even primitive, as they depended greatly upon the effectiveness of his melodies.
