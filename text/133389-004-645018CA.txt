Louis Renault,  (born 1877, Paris, France—died  Oct. 24, 1944, Paris) manufacturer who built the largest automobile company in France.
Renault built his first automobile in 1898. He and his brothers Fernand and Marcel then built a series of small cars and formed the automobile firm Renault Frères (“Renault Brothers”). Renault vehicles attracted much attention by winning numerous road races until Marcel was killed during a Paris-Madrid run in 1903. Renault then abandoned racing and concentrated on manufacturing. In 1918 he produced the Renault tank, which was often used as a troop-escort vehicle in the last months of World War I. He continued to increase the productive capacity of his Boulogne-Billancourt works and after the war extended his production to include farm equipment, marine and industrial machinery, and diesel motors.
