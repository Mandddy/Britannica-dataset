Eagle owl,  (Bubo bubo), bird of the family Strigidae (order Strigiformes), characterized by its large size (often 70 centimetres [about 2.3 feet] long), two tufts of feathers on the head (ear tufts), and large orange eyes. The overall coloration is tawny, mottled with brown, lighter below. The eagle owl roosts and breeds within rocky niches and hollow trees. At twilight it perches on a branch while searching its territory for prey, mainly rodents, hares, rabbits, and large game birds.
The eagle owl, sometimes called the Eurasian eagle owl, inhabits Europe, Asia, and northern Africa but is only a straggler in most of Great Britain. It is a horned owl (q.v.), related to the great horned owl (B. virginianus) of America.
