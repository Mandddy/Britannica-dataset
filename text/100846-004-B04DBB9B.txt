Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), Spanish Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional,  guerrilla group in Mexico, founded in the late 20th century and named for the early 20th-century peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. On Jan. 1, 1994, the Zapatistas staged a rebellion from their base in Chiapas, the southernmost Mexican state, to protest economic policies that they believed would negatively affect Mexico’s indigenous population. The insurgency later developed into a forceful political movement that advocated for Mexico’s disenfranchised Indians.
The early history of the Zapatista movement is obscure. Although members claimed that the group had been founded as early as 1983, it did not begin to attract followers until the early 1990s. In 1993, from its base in the Lancadón rainforest of eastern Chiapas state, the group called for Mexico’s Indians to rise up against the one-party rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional; PRI). The primary goal of the Zapatistas was land reform and redistribution. They also demanded greater political and cultural autonomy for the indigenous people of Chiapas and the rest of Mexico. The main impetus for the Zapatista rebellion was a series of economic reforms introduced by the Mexican government that were intended to prepare Mexico for integration into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a free-trade pact linking Mexico, the United States, and Canada. In particular, a land reform bill introduced in 1993 sought to privatize the country’s ejidos, or communal farms. The Zapatistas argued that NAFTA and land reform would lead to further impoverishment of the Indians.
