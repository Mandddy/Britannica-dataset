Cuyahoga River, river in northeastern Ohio, U.S., rising 15 miles (24 km) south of Lake Erie and 35 miles (56 km) east of Cleveland. It flows southwestward to the city of Cuyahoga Falls (where its falls were eliminated by a series of dams) on the northern edge of Akron; there it drops into a large, deep valley and turns sharply northward. Upon reaching the lake plain about 6 miles (10 km) from its mouth, it continues as a sharply meandering stream, entrenched to a depth of 60–125 feet (18–38 metres), before emptying into Lake Erie at Cleveland, where its mouth forms part of Cleveland’s harbour. Some meanders have been widened so that the river is navigable for lake freighters to about 5 miles (8 km) upstream; its total length is about 80 miles (130 km). Cuyahoga receives the Little Cuyahoga River near Akron. Its name is Iroquoian, possibly meaning “crooked water” or “place of the jawbone.”
With the opening of the Cleveland-to-Akron section of the Ohio and Erie Canal in 1827 (closed 1913), the Cuyahoga region became a centre of commercial transportation. It subsequently became highly industrialized, and by the mid-20th century the lower reaches of the Cuyahoga River had become one of the most severely polluted rivers in the United States; national attention was focused on the Cuyahoga’s condition when, on June 22, 1969, an oil slick floating on the river surface caught fire, damaging two railroad bridges before it was brought under control. By the late 1970s, however, antipollution measures had substantially improved the condition of the river.
