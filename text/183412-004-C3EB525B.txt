Cockfighting, the sport of pitting gamecocks to fight and the breeding and training of them for that purpose. The game fowl is probably the nearest to the Indian red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), from which all domestic chickens are believed to be descended.
The sport was popular in ancient times in India, China, Persia, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524–460 bc). The sport spread throughout Asia Minor and Sicily. For a long time the Romans affected a despisement of this “Greek diversion,” but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century ad) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting at the side of the pit.
