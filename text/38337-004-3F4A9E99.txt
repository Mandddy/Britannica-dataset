Carlos Antonio López,  (born Nov. 4, 1790, Asunción, Río de la Plata—died  Sept. 10, 1862, Asunción, Paraguay) second dictator of Paraguay, who ended his country’s isolation, sought to modernize Paraguay, and became deeply involved in international disputes.
López was the son of poor parents, reportedly of Indian and Spanish descent. After attending the San Carlos Seminary in Asunción, he taught there until it was closed by the dictator José Gaspar Rodríquez de Francia. López, who had married into one of the country’s leading families, was exiled to his estancia (ranch). In 1841, a year after Rodríguez de Francia’s death, López became the principal of the two consuls ruling the country. Governing Paraguay constitutionally until 1844, he then suspended the constitution and dismissed his fellow consul, making himself dictator. An exceedingly corrupt ruler, who owned half his country’s land and never bothered to make a distinction between his own and his country’s revenue, he placed most of Paraguay’s commerce in the hands of his family.
