Hermann Von Salza ,  (born c. 1170—died  March 20, 1239, Salerno [Italy]) German grand master (Hochmeister), from 1210 to 1239, of the organization of German crusaders called the Teutonic Order.
Born to a minor aristocratic family of Thuringia, Hermann had made his way by sheer ability to the powerful office of grand master of the Teutonic Order by 1210. He gradually earned the confidence and support of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II (reigned 1220–50), whom he served as a diplomat and councillor. As grand master, Herman began to shift his order’s Christianizing and military activities away from the limited opportunities left in the Middle East in the wake of the failed late Crusades and toward the expanding pagan populations of eastern Europe. Hermann’s first enterprise, in Hungary, failed when the order was expelled from that region in 1225, but the order was soon afterward (1226) invited by Conrad of Mazovia to conquer and convert the Prussians in the region of the Vistula River. Hermann obtained a land grant in the region from Conrad, as well as a charter from Frederick II confirming the order’s mission and sovereignty among the Prussians. Hermann eventually (1233) initiated a general campaign for the conquest of Prussia under the direction of the provincial order leader Hermann Balk.
