Harry Bertoia, original name Arri Bertoia  (born March 10, 1915, San Lorenzo, Udine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy—died November 6, 1978, Barto, Pennsylvania, U.S.) Italian-born American sculptor, printmaker, and jewelry and furniture designer best known for his monumental architectural sculptures and classic Bertoia Diamond chair.
Bertoia attended the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and taught painting and metalworking there from 1937 to 1943. While at Cranbrook he experimented with printmaking and created a large collection of monoprints. In 1943 he sold about 100 of them to Hilla Rebay of New York’s Museum of Non-Objective Painting (now the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum), and a number of them were included soon after in an exhibition. Bertoia set off for California in 1943 and worked with designers Charles and Ray Eames, whom he had met at Cranbrook. It is widely held that Bertoia designed elements of the Eames’s furniture line but received no credit for his contributions. Unhappy with that arrangement, he moved on to join Knoll Associates in New York City in 1950. His achievements there included the 1952 Diamond chair (more commonly known as the Bertoia chair)—made of polished steel wire, sometimes vinyl coated, and covered with cotton or with elastic Naugahyde upholstery—as well as a side chair and a barstool made with the same mesh wire frames and the Bertoia bird chair and bird ottoman. Bertoia’s furniture line was (and still is) so popular that he was able to focus on his sculpture while he made a living from his furniture sales.
