Founding, the process of pouring molten metal into a cavity that has been molded according to a pattern of the desired shape. When the metal solidifies, the result is a castingâ€”a metal object conforming to that shape. A great variety of metal objects are so molded at some point during their manufacture.
The most common type of mold is made of sand and clay; ceramics, sand with cement, metals, and other materials are also used for molds. These materials are packed over the face of the pattern (usually made of wood, metal, or resin) that forms the cavity into which the molten metal is to be poured. The pattern is removed from the mold when its shape is able to be retained by the mold material. Molds are usually constructed in two halves, and the two halves are joined together once the pattern has been removed from them. Pins and bushings permit precise joining of the two halves, which together are enclosed in a mold box. The metal is then poured into the mold through special gates and is distributed by runners to different areas of the casting. The mold must be strong enough to resist the pressure of the molten metal and sufficiently permeable to permit the escape of air and other gases from the mold cavity; otherwise, they would remain as holes in the casting. The mold material must also resist fusion with the molten metal, and the sand at the mold surface must be closely packed to give a smooth casting surface.
