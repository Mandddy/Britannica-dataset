Suffolk, administrative and historic county in East Anglia, eastern England. It is bounded to the north by Norfolk, to the west by Cambridgeshire, to the south by Essex, and to the east by the North Sea. The administrative county comprises seven districts: Forest Heath and the borough of Saint Edmundsbury in the west, Mid Suffolk in the middle, Babergh and the borough of Ipswich (the county seat) in the south, and Suffolk Coastal and Waveney on the North Sea coast. The administrative county is nearly coterminous with the historic county, but the historic county also includes the area south of Breydon Water in Great Yarmouth borough in the administrative county of Norfolk.
Suffolk exhibits a wide variety of landscapes. The coastline has fine sandy beaches, crumbling cliffs (the former town of Dunwich has been washed into the sea), deep estuaries, and the spit of Orford Ness. The centre of the county has low rolling hills, and in the west rises a chalk ridge covered by broad, hedgeless fields. The northwestern corner of Suffolk, where it borders Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, forms part of the Fens and is below sea level. East of the Fens lies Breckland, a region of sand, heath, and long lines of trees planted originally for windbreaks and game cover.
