Bremerhaven, city, Bremen Land (state), northern Germany. It lies on the east side of the Weser estuary, on both banks of the Geest River at its junction with the Weser. It became a municipality by the amalgamation of three separate towns: Bremerhaven, founded (1827) as a port for Bremen by its burgomaster, Johann Smidt, on territory ceded by Hanover; Geestemünde, founded by Hanover in competition in 1845; and Lehe, a borough dating from medieval times that attained town status in 1920. The union of Lehe and Geestemünde in 1924 formed the town of Wesermünde, which in turn absorbed Bremerhaven in 1939, under Hanoverian jurisdiction. This unified city, restored to Bremen in 1947, was thereafter known by the name of Bremerhaven.
Repeated cessions of Prussian territory expanded the docks after the opening of the “Old Harbour” in 1830, and Bremerhaven developed as Germany’s largest fishing port. After 1857, as headquarters of the North German Lloyd Shipping Company (Norddeutsche Lloyd), it became the largest passenger port, with its Columbus Quay and Columbus Station handling transatlantic traffic. Most freight traffic was diverted to Bremen after improvements were made to the Weser Channel (1883–94). The harbour is now especially important for handling containers and the import and export of motor vehicles. Industry is based primarily on food processing and shipbuilding.
