Hudson River, river in New York state, U.S. It flows almost entirely within the state, the exception being its final segment, where it forms the boundary between New York and New Jersey for 21 miles (34 km). The Hudson originates in several small postglacial lakes in the Adirondack Mountains near Mount Marcy (5,344 feet [1,629 metres]), the highest point in New York, and flows about 315 miles (507 km) through the eastern part of the state. Lake Tear of the Clouds is regarded as the source of its main headstream, the Opalescent River.
The Hudson follows a winding course for its first 108 miles (174 km), flowing generally southeast to Corinth in Saratoga county and then northeast to Hudson Falls. From there it flows (without significant gradient) almost directly south for 200 miles (320 km) to the Battery at the head of Upper New York Bay (at New York City). It drains an area of 13,370 square miles (34,628 square km). Its lower course, about 150 miles (240 km) long, occupies a drowned valley; extending seaward from its mouth for about 200 miles is a deep submarine canyon. Tides are felt as far north as the federal dam at Troy, where the mean tidal range is 4.7 feet (1.4 metres). The river reaches its widest point—3 miles (5 km)—at Haverstraw Bay (between Westchester and Rockland counties) before narrowing again to 0.75 mile (1.2 km) at its mouth. Together with the Mohawk River, its major tributary, it forms one of the nation’s most important waterways.
