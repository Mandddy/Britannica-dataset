Philip Schaff,  (born Jan. 1, 1819, Chur, Switz.—died  Oct. 20, 1893, New York, N.Y., U.S.) Swiss-born American ecumenical leader and theologian whose works, especially the Creeds of Christendom (1877), helped set standards in the United States for scholarship in church history.
Schaff was educated at the universities of Tübingen, Halle, and Berlin and was made a lecturer in 1842 at Berlin, where his interest in church history was aroused by the famed church historian Johann Neander. Schaff emigrated to the United States in 1844 and in the same year became professor of church history and biblical literature at the Theological Seminary of the German Reformed Church at Mercersburg, Pa. On his installation he delivered a controversial address, published as The Principle of Protestantism, in which he expressed his view that the positive values of both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism would eventually be blended in an ecumenical, evangelical Catholicism. The address provoked criticism and charges of heresy, but Schaff was exonerated by the Eastern Synod of his church in 1845.
