Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also called white fox or polar fox,  northern fox of the family Canidae, found throughout the Arctic region, usually on tundra or mountains near the sea.
Fully grown adults reach about 50–60 cm (20–24 inches) in length, exclusive of the 30-cm (12-inch) tail, and a weight of about 3–8 kg (6.6–17 pounds). As an adaptation to the climate, Arctic foxes have short rounded ears, a short muzzle, and fur-covered soles. Coloration depends on whether the animal is of the “white” or the “blue” colour phase. Individuals of the white phase are grayish brown in summer and white in winter, while those of the blue phase (blue foxes of the fur trade) are grayish in summer and gray-blue in winter.
