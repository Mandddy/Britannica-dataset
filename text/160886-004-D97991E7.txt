Wyatt Earp, in full Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp  (born March 19, 1848, Monmouth, Illinois, U.S.—died January 13, 1929, Los Angeles, California) legendary frontiersman of the American West, who was an itinerant saloonkeeper, gambler, lawman, gunslinger, and confidence man. The first major biography, Stuart N. Lake’s Wyatt Earp, Frontier Marshal (1931), written with Earp’s collaboration, established the rather fictionalized portrait of a fearless lawman.
Earp and his four brothers—James C. (1841–1926), Virgil W. (1843–1906), Morgan (1851–82), and Warren B. (1855–1900)—spent their early lives in Illinois and Iowa but, toward the end of the American Civil War (1864), moved with their parents to San Bernardino, California. In 1868 the family moved back to Illinois, Wyatt and Virgil working on a Union Pacific Railroad crew on the way home. After the Earps moved to Lamar, Missouri, Wyatt married in 1870 and was elected local constable, but upon his wife’s death of typhoid, he took off, drifting from Indian Territory to various towns in Kansas. He worked as a police officer in Wichita (1875–76) and Dodge City (1876-77), went off to the gold rush in the Black Hills (1877–78), and returned to Dodge City as assistant marshal (1878–79), where he became noted as both lawman and gambler and where he befriended such gunmen as Doc Holliday and Bat Masterson.
