Sir Ian McKellen, in full Sir Ian Murray McKellen  (born May 25, 1939, Burnley, Lancashire, England) British actor of great versatility, noted for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company and for his eclectic filmography.
McKellen attended St. Catharine’s College, Cambridge, where as a student actor he was often directed by John Barton, later of the Royal Shakespeare Company. After receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1961, McKellen made his professional debut in Robert Bolt’s A Man for All Seasons. Acting steadily throughout the 1960s, McKellen won both popular and critical acclaim in his performances as both William Shakespeare’s Richard II and Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II for the 1969 Edinburgh Festival. In 1971 he cofounded the Actors’ Company, a collective of actors who had equal say in the choosing and casting of plays and in the recruiting of directors. He left the group in 1974 to join the Royal Shakespeare Company at the invitation of Barton.
