Sōtō, largest of the Zen Buddhist sects in Japan. It follows the method of quiet sitting and meditation (zazen) as a means of obtaining enlightenment.
The sect was founded in China in the 9th century by Liang-chieh and Pen-chi, where it was known as Ts’ao-tung (after its monastic centres on the mountains Ts’ao and Tung). It was transmitted to Japan by Dōgen, who founded the Eihei Temple in 1244 in what is now Fukui prefecture, and further popularized in the 13th–14th century by Keizan.
