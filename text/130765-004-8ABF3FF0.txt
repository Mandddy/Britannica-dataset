Videophone, also called video telephone,  device that simultaneously transmits and receives both audio and video signals over telephone lines.
In addition to the two-way speech transmission traditionally associated with the telephone, for many years there has been an interest in transmitting two-way video signals over telephone circuits in order to facilitate communication between two parties. Two-way video communication systems employ a videophone at each end. The videophone incorporates a personal video camera and display, a microphone and speaker, and a data-conversion device. The data-conversion device permits transmission of video over telephone circuits through the use of two components: a compression/expansion circuit, which reduces the amount of information contained in the video signal, and a modem, which translates the digital video signal to the analog telephone line format.
