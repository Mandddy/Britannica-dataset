Angel shark (genus Squatina), any of about 15 species of sharks that constitute a single genus (family Squatinidae, order Squatiniformes) characterized by flattened heads and bodies, with winglike pectoral and pelvic fins that make them resemble rays. The tail bears two dorsal fins and a well-developed caudal fin. The upper surface of the head features the eyes, behind each of which is a prominent spiracle. Five gill slits occur in front of the pectoral fins. The angel shark ranges up to 2.5 metres (6.25 feet) in length.
Angel sharks are found in tropical and warm temperate waters of the continental shelf worldwide. One species, Squatina squatina, was once frequently caught unintentionally in fishing nets and was later listed as critically endangered.
