Clement VII, original name Giulio de’ Medici   (born May 26, 1478, Florence [Italy]—died Sept. 25, 1534, Rome) pope from 1523 to 1534.
An illegitimate son of Giuliano de’ Medici, he was reared by his uncle Lorenzo the Magnificent. He was made archbishop of Florence and cardinal in 1513 by his cousin Pope Leo X, whose political policies he influenced. As cardinal he commissioned Raphael to paint the huge altarpiece the “Transfiguration” for his cathedral at Narbonne, France. He planned an impressive group of monuments to members of his family for the New Sacristy (Sagrestia Nuova) in San Lorenzo, Florence, and in 1520 Michelangelo began the designs, which were to rank among the finest of his sculptures. In 1523 he was elected to succeed Adrian VI. His reign was dominated by the spread of the Protestant Reformation, the conflict between France and the Empire, and the divorce of Henry VIII of England.
