Wincenty Witos,  (born Jan. 22, 1874, Wierzchosławice, Galicia, Pol., Austria-Hungary—died  Oct. 30, 1945, Kraków) Polish statesman and leader of the Peasant Party, who was three times prime minister of Poland (1920–21, 1923, 1926).
Witos sat during 1908–14 in the Galician Sejm (Diet) of Austria-Poland and in 1911–18 in the Austrian Reichsrat (lower house of parliament). After World War I he was elected to the Sejm of the newly established republic of Poland and soon became the leader of the Peasant Party, then the strongest political group in the Sejm. From July 1920 to September 1921 he served as prime minister of an all-party coalition. In May–December 1923 he headed his second government but was unable to halt inflation and national unrest. Although initially identified with the parties of the left, Witos gradually emerged as a force for conservatism and in May 1926 formed his third administration on an exclusively right-of-centre base. Within a few days, however, his Cabinet was overthrown by a coup led by the national hero Józef Piłsudski.
