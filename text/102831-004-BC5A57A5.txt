BCS, in full Bowl Championship Series,  former arrangement of five American college postseason gridiron football games that annually determined the national champion. The games involved were the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Fiesta Bowl, and the BCS National Championship Game. In 2014 the BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff.
The teams that participated in the BCS were drawn from the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly known as Division I-A) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and were determined by a ranking system that consisted of three equally weighted components: the USA Today Coaches’ Poll, the Harris Interactive College Football Poll, and an average of six computer rankings. The two teams that topped the rankings at the end of the regular season met in the BCS National Championship Game, which rotated its location between the sites of the four bowls and took place a few days after the bowl game that is traditionally held at that site. The 10 BCS participants were selected by the individual bowl committees from a pool that consisted of the automatically qualifying champions of the six “major conferences” (the American Athletic, Atlantic Coast, Big 12, Big Ten, Pacific-12, and Southeastern conferences) and four at-large teams. There was also a stipulation that awards automatic BCS berths—at the expense of major conference at-large selections—to members of the five other conferences in the FBS if they were among the top 12 teams in the final BCS rankings. Moreover, by special arrangement, if the University of Notre Dame, a traditional football power that has no conference affiliation, was among the top eight teams in the final BCS rankings, it too received an automatic berth.
