Michael Douglas, in full Michael Kirk Douglas  (born September 25, 1944, New Brunswick, New Jersey, U.S.) American film actor and producer who is best known for his intense portrayals of flawed heroes.
Douglas, the son of film legend Kirk Douglas and British actress Diana Dill, received much of his education in filmmaking by accompanying his father to various film locations. After studying drama at the University of California at Santa Barbara (B.A., 1968), Douglas made his screen debut in Hail, Hero! (1969), a Vietnam-era antiwar film now regarded as hyperbolic and dated. He made a handful of mostly forgettable films—the best of which was the Disney-produced family adventure Napoleon and Samantha (1972)—before landing the role of Steve Keller on the popular television series The Streets of San Francisco (1972), costarring with veteran actor Karl Malden.
