Charles Russell, Baron Russell,  (born November 10, 1832, Newry, County Down, Ireland—died August 10, 1900, London, England) lord chief justice of England from June 1894 until his death. A formidable courtroom advocate, he became widely admired as a strong but moderate judge.
Russell practiced law in Ireland from 1854 and in England (usually at Liverpool) from 1859. In 1872 he was appointed a queen’s counsel. A Liberal Party member of the House of Commons from 1880 to 1894, he served as attorney general under Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone in 1886 and again in 1892–94. Although he was sympathetic to Irish nationalism, he urged the establishment of an Irish Parliament subordinate to England’s, rather than the granting of Home Rule, which would have given the Irish wider power. In 1888–90 he gained fame as principal defense counsel before the Parnell Commission by discrediting much of the testimony against the Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell, especially that based on a letter forged by a journalist, Richard Pigott.
