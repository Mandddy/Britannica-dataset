Phil Rizzuto, byname of Fiero (Phillip) Francis Rizzuto, also called Scooter  (born Sept. 25, 1917, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 13, 2007, West Orange, N.J.) American professional baseball player and broadcaster who played and worked for the New York Yankees for over 50 years.
The 5-foot 6-inch (1.68-metre), 150-pound Rizzuto was rejected by his hometown Brooklyn Dodgers because of his diminutive size but signed with the Yankees in 1937. His nickname, “Scooter,” was given to him in 1939 by a minor league teammate in response to the short strides Rizzuto took when running the bases. Rizzuto, a shortstop, was called up to the major leagues in 1941 and played with the Yankees until 1956. He missed the 1943–45 seasons while he served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. In 1950 Rizzuto had a .324 batting average, with 200 hits and 92 walks, and he was named the Most Valuable Player in the American League.
