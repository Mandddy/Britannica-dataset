Charles Barkley, in full Charles Wade Barkley, bynames Sir Charles and the Round Mound of Rebound  (born Feb. 20, 1963, Leeds, Ala., U.S.) American professional basketball player and television personality whose larger-than-life character made him one of the most popular figures in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. Over the course of his 16-year NBA career, he became just the fourth player to amass 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists.
Barkley was a nondescript high school basketball player until a 6-inch (15-cm) growth spurt helped him become one of the better players in Alabama during his senior year and earn a scholarship to Auburn University. He was an all-conference selection in each of his three seasons at Auburn, and in 1984 he was chosen by the Philadelphia 76ers with the fifth overall pick of the NBA draft. Listed at 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 metres) tall but by most accounts about 2 inches (5 cm) shorter, Barkley was very undersized for a forward, but his great leaping ability and his skill at establishing position around the basket using his considerable strength quickly made him one of the elite rebounders in the game. He made the first of 11 consecutive All-Star Game appearances in 1987, but the 76ers’ success as a team was limited. With the exception of a run to the Eastern Conference finals during his rookie season (on a team led by future Hall of Famers Julius Erving and Moses Malone), Barkley and the 76ers never advanced farther than the second round of the play-offs during his eight seasons in Philadelphia. His inability to get the 76ers a championship led some to question whether he should be considered a truly elite player. Coupling this with Barkley’s outspokenness, which made him unpopular with the team’s front office, the team decided to trade him to the Phoenix Suns in 1992.
