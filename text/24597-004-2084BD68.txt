Melville Weston Fuller,  (born Feb. 11, 1833, Augusta, Maine, U.S.—died July 4, 1910, Sorrento, Maine) eighth chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1888–1910), whose amiability, impartiality, and rare administrative skill enabled him to manage court conferences efficiently and to resolve or forestall serious disputes among the justices whom he superintended. Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Samuel F. Miller, two outstanding members of the Fuller court, called him the best presiding judge they had ever known.
Graduated from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine (1853), Fuller attended Harvard Law School briefly, was a newspaperman in Augusta for a time, was admitted to the bar in 1855, and from 1856 practiced law in Chicago. He was elected as a Democrat to the Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1861 and to the State House of Representatives in 1862.
