Rangitikei River, river in southwestern North Island, New Zealand. Rising on the east slopes of the Kaimanawa Mountains, it flows south and southwest for 150 miles (240 km) to enter South Taranaki Bight of the Tasman Sea, 60 miles (97 km) south of Wanganui. The river—with its principal tributaries, the Moawhango and Hautapu—drains a basin 1,230 square miles (3,190 square km) in area. Its upper course flows steeply through a gorge as far as Marton, below which the valley broadens to form part of the Manawatu plains. Chief settlements of the valley, which supports fat-lamb and dairy farming, are Utiku, Mangaweka, Ohingaiti, and Bulls.
