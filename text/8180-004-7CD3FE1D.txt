Keeshond, also called Dutch barge dog ,  breed of dog long kept on Dutch barges as a guard and companion. Originally a dog kept by working-class people, the keeshond was the symbol of the 18th-century Dutch Patriots Party. It derived its present name from a dog, Kees, belonging to Kees de Gyselaer, the leader of the Patriots. Descended from the same ancestors as the Samoyed, Norwegian elkhound, spitz, and Pomeranian, the keeshond has a foxlike face and a plumed tail carried high over its back. Its long, thick, gray coat consists of a pale undercoat overlaid by black-tipped hairs. Shadings and markings around the eyes give the impression of spectacles. The mature keeshond stands 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46 cm) and weighs 55 to 66 pounds (25 to 30 kg). It is the national dog of the Netherlands.
