Trichostome,  any ciliate protozoan of the holotrichous order Trichostomatida. Free-living forms are found in freshwater (e.g., Tillina), salt water (e.g., Woodruffia), and decaying vegetation; parasitic forms also occur. Trichostomes usually have a heavily ciliated vestibule (outer cavity) that leads to the ventrally located mouth. Body ciliation is uniform, although it may be reduced in parasitic species. Reproduction by fission or budding may occur during either the active or the encysted state. The freshwater genus Colpoda, widely studied experimentally, divides only while encysted. The parasitic forms include the genus Balantidium, which infests the intestines of many animals and, in rare cases, may cause a severe type of human dysentery; another genus (Isotricha) lives in the stomachs of cattle and sheep.
