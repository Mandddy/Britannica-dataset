Georg Stiernhielm, original name Jöran Olofsson, also called Georgius Olai, orGöran Lilia  (born Aug. 7, 1598, Vika, Swed.—died  April 22, 1672, Stockholm) poet and scholar, often called “the father of Swedish poetry.”
Stiernhielm, the son of a miner, studied at Uppsala and spent several years at the German universities of Greifswald, Wittenberg, and Helmstedt. He returned to Sweden in 1626 and soon obtained a judicial position in Dorpat. In 1631 he was raised to the nobility. From c. 1640 he was occasionally in Stockholm as poet in attendance at the court of Queen Christina, although his home was in Estonia until 1656, when he fled before the Russian invaders. Thereafter he lived in Stockholm in straitened circumstances. In 1661 he was appointed councillor of war and in 1667 director of the college of antiquities.
