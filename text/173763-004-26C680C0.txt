Donald O’Connor, in full Donald David Dixon Ronald O’Connor  (born August 28, 1925, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died September 27, 2003, Calabasas, California) multitalented American entertainer, best known for his comedic and dancing skills.
Born into a family of circus and vaudeville performers, O’Connor made his first stage appearance at the age of 13 months. He spent his childhood touring with his family’s vaudeville act and was reportedly able to dance before he could stand up straight, to sing before he developed a vocabulary, and to play several musical instruments before he learned to read music. In 1937 he and his two brothers were hired for a specialty number in the musical Melody for Two. The following year he was signed to a $250-per-week contract at Paramount Pictures; his first film was Sing, You Sinners (1938), in which he played Bing Crosby’s younger brother. During his one-year stay at Paramount, he occasionally portrayed the leading man as a youth in such films as Men with Wings (1938) and Beau Geste (1939). He was also cast as Huck Finn in Tom Sawyer, Detective (1938). In 1941 he signed with Universal Pictures, where he rose to film stardom in a series of peppy, low-budget musicals, usually appearing opposite singer-dancer Peggy Ryan.
