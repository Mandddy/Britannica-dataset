All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd. (ANA), Japanese Zen Nippon Kūyu,  the largest domestic air carrier in Japan, and one of the largest in the world. The company was founded in 1952 and is headquartered in Tokyo. Under the Japanese government’s strict regulation of civil aviation, All Nippon Airways was basically restricted to carrying passengers and freight on Japan’s major domestic routes, while Japan Air Lines basically monopolized the country’s overseas air service. All Nippon began making chartered flights to other East Asian countries in the 1970s, however, and in the late 1980s it began regular service on major international routes, taking advantage of certain deregulation measures in the industry. The company has subsidiaries involved in aircraft maintenance, repair, and refueling; other subsidiaries operate hotels and provide package tours for All Nippon’s passengers.
