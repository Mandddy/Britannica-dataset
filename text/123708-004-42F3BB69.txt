Carl Milles, original name Wilhelm Carl Emil Andersson  (born June 23, 1875, Lagga, near Uppsala, Sweden—died September 19, 1955, Lidingö) Swedish sculptor known for his expressive and rhythmical large-scale fountains.
Milles studied and worked in Paris from 1897 to 1904. He won public recognition in 1902 through the competition for a monument honouring the Swedish regent Sten Sture at Uppsala (completed 1925). In his early work Milles was influenced by the French Romantic sculptor Auguste Rodin. From 1904 to 1906 he lived in Munich, Germany, where he encountered medieval and early Greek art as interpreted by the German sculptor-theorist Adolf von Hildebrand.
