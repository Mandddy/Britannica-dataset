Bushmaster (genus Lachesis), the longest venomous snake in the New World, found in scrublands and forests from the Amazon River basin north to Costa Rica. Three species of bushmaster (L. muta, L. stenophrys, and L. melanocephala) are known to exist, and they normally measure about 1.8 metres (6 feet) long but may grow to as long as 3 metres (10 feet). These large snakes are reddish brown to pinkish gray in colour, matching their forest floor habitats, and they may bear x-like or diamond patterns across the back. Although seldom encountered, the bushmaster is dangerous, with a potentially lethal venom.
The bushmaster is a pit viper (subfamily Crotalinae). Infrared pits, located between the eyes and nostrils, are used to “smell” prey, which consists mostly of small rodents. Prey is swallowed head-first, but the snake will bite and then release larger or more dangerous prey. In this type of attack, their eyes and pits are well protected by folds of skin.
