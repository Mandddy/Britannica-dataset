Marie Sallé,  (born 1707—died July 27, 1756, Paris, France) innovative French dancer and choreographer who performed expressive, dramatic dances during a period when displays of technical virtuosity were more popular. The first woman to choreograph the ballets in which she appeared, she anticipated the late 18th-century reforms of Jean-Georges Noverre by integrating the music, costumes, and dance styles of her ballets with their themes.
After childhood appearances in England, Sallé studied with Françoise Prévost, who sponsored her Paris Opéra debut in 1721. As early as 1729, she and her partner danced without the masks (traditionally used by dancers and only formally abolished about 1770) to permit interplay of facial expression when they appeared together in the pas de deux Les Caractères de la danse. A rival of Marie Camargo, who also danced at the Paris Opéra, Sallé achieved her greatest success in London, where, in 1734, she created the solo Les Caractères de l’amour and a ballet, Bacchus and Ariadne, which revealed her power as a tragic actress. For the role of Venus in her revolutionary Pygmalion (also first performed in London, 1734), she discarded the elaborate, restrictive costume typical of 18th-century ballet for a Grecian-style muslin dress and loose, unornamented hair. The following year she danced in many of George Frideric Handel’s operas. Returning to Paris during Camargo’s temporary retirement, she attained great distinction in 1737 as Hébé in Castor et Pollux. In 1740 she retired from the Opéra but intermittently appeared at French court performances until 1752. She was admired by Voltaire, David Garrick, and Noverre and is remembered for her creativity and intelligence as well as for her grace and expressiveness.
