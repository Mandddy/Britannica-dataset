Erebuni,  ancient Urartian palace-fortress probably built by King Argishti I in the first quarter of the 8th century bc; it was located on the hill of Arin Berd, near modern Yerevan in Armenia. Excavations at Erebuni have centred on the palace and temple; both buildings contained important wall paintings (done primarily in dark blue and red on a white background) that show distinct similarities to Assyrian wall paintings. Of particular interest was a room containing 30 columns, regarded by some scholars to be the forerunner of the Achaemenian columned hall.
