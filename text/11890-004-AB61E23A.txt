Georges Feydeau, in full Georges-Léon-Jules-Marie Feydeau   (born Dec. 8, 1862, Paris, France—died  June 5, 1921, Paris) French dramatist whose farces delighted Parisian audiences in the years immediately prior to World War I and are still regularly performed.
Feydeau was the son of the novelist Ernest Feydeau, the author of the novel Fanny (1858). The younger Feydeau was an able actor and director and wrote 39 plays between 1881 and 1916. Working in the tradition of the late 19th-century comic-dramatist Eugène Labiche, he took the farce to new heights on the French stage. Though not a serious social critic, he made satiric capital out of every new fashion while continuing to exploit all the traditional butts of broad and undemanding comedy—cuckolds, silly wives, foreigners, the aged, and the deformed.
