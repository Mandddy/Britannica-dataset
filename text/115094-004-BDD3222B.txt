Saint Peter Claver, Spanish San Pedro Claver  (born 1581, Verdu, Spain—died Sept. 4, 1654, Cartagena, Colom.; canonized 1888; feast day September 9) Jesuit missionary to South America who, in dedicating his life to the aid of Negro slaves, earned the title of apostle of the Negroes.
Peter entered the Society of Jesus in 1602 and eight years later was sent to Cartagena, where he was ordained in 1616. The miserable condition of the slaves aboard ship and in the pens of Cartagena, South America’s chief slave market, caused Peter to declare himself “the slave of the Negroes forever.” Accompanied by interpreters and carrying food and medicines, he boarded every incoming slave ship and visited the pens, where he nursed the sick and taught religion. Despite strong official opposition, Peter persevered for 38 years, baptizing an estimated 300,000 slaves. He was canonized by Pope Leo XIII, who in 1896 proclaimed him patron of all Roman Catholic missions to Negroes.
