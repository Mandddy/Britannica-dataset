Cutlery, cutting implements, such as knives, razors, and scissors, used for industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes.
Prehistoric implements used for cutting, hunting, and defense were fashioned from stone, especially flint; from obsidian, a volcanic glass; and from bones and shells. Cutting edges were formed by rubbing the implement in the hollow of a stone, a method still employed by aborigines of central Brazil, Australia, and New Guinea. By 1500 bce bronze cutting implements were being used from the British Isles to China. Scissors with blades connected by a C-shaped spring at the handle end also originated at about this time. As various metals became known, the art of forging blades developed in China, India, and Europe. Pivoted scissors of bronze or iron, connected by a rivet or screw between the handles and blades, were known in ancient Rome and in China, Japan, and Korea.
