Adder, any of several groups of venomous snakes of the viper family, Viperidae, and the Australo-Papuan death adders, viperlike members of Elapidae, the cobra family. The name adder may also be applied to certain other snakes, such as the hognose snake (Heterodon), a harmless North American genus. Among the adders of the viper family are the European common adder (Vipera berus), the puff adders (9 or 10 species of Bitis, including B. arietans), and the night adders (four species of Causus).
The European common adder, or European viper (V. berus), a serpent often mentioned in works of literature, is a stout-bodied snake that is widely distributed across Europe and Asia. It even ranges north of the Arctic Circle in Norway. It grows to a maximum length of approximately 85 cm (33 inches) and is usually gray to brown with a dark zigzag band on the back and spots on the sides. The common adder eats frogs, young birds, and small mammals. It bears its young alive, and 6â€“20 are born in August or early September. Its bite is rarely fatal to humans.
