Tony La Russa, byname of Anthony La Russa, Jr.  (born October 4, 1944, Tampa, Florida, U.S.) American professional baseball manager who led his teams to three World Series titles (1989, 2006, and 2011) and accumulated the third most managerial wins (2,728) in major league history.
La Russa signed to play baseball with the Kansas City Athletics (or “A’s”) out of high school. He spent the majority of his 16-season playing career in the minor leagues, but he appeared sporadically in the majors with the A’s (both in Kansas City and, later, in Oakland, where the franchise moved), the Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. He was named the manager of a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1978, and his first big-league managerial job came the following year, when he took over the White Sox late in the 1979 season.
