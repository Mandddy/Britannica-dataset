Matsukata Masayoshi, in full (from 1906) Kōshaku (Prince) Matsukata Masayoshi  (born April 3, 1834, Kagoshima, Japan—died July 2, 1924, Tokyo) statesman whose financial reforms stabilized and restored Japanese government finances in the 1880s, giving Japan the capital with which to modernize.
Matsukata was a high-ranking official in the Satsuma domain when the Tokugawa family was overthrown and ruling authority was formally restored to the emperor (1867–68). He then held various important positions in the new government and by 1881 was minister of finance. As such, he became the major advocate and executor of financial reform.
