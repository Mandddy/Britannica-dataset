John Of Kronshtadt, original name Ivan Ilich Sergeyev   (born Oct. 31, 1829, near Arkhangelsk, Russia—died  Jan. 2, 1909, Kronshtadt) Russian Orthodox priest-ascetic whose pastoral and educational activities, particularly among the unskilled poor, contributed notably to Russia’s social and spiritual reform.
After graduating from the theological academy in St. Petersburg, John entered the married priesthood in 1855 and went to Kronshtadt to minister at the parish church of St. Andrew. There he established among the underprivileged a fraternal association and “work centre” that offered instruction in industrial arts, technical and general education, religious training, and social services. “Father John,” as he was called, exercised a widespread moral authority among the various social classes and was reputed to have performed wonders and miracles. He influenced many in the corrupt and despairing Russian society toward moral conversion and a return to religious practices.
