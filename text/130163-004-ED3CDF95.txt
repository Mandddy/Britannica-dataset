Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), virus of the Herpesviridae family that is the major cause of acute infectious mononucleosis, a common syndrome characterized by fever, sore throat, extreme fatigue, and swollen lymph glands.
Epstein-Barr virus was first reported by British scientists M.A. Epstein, Y.M. Barr, and B.G. Achong, who found viruslike particles in cells grown from tissues involved with a newly described lymphatic cancer. The Epstein-Barr virus is known to be able to infect only two different types of cells in the body: some salivary gland cells and one special type of white blood cell (leukocyte). Virus that infects the salivary gland cell is carried into the mouth in the stream of saliva, which is the only bodily fluid that has been proved to contain infectious EBV particles. The type of white blood cell called the B lymphocyte can also carry Epstein-Barr virus. These highly specialized cells manufacture antibodies to help fight infections. Within the salivary gland the virus growth cycle is completed, and infectious virus particles are generated; within the B lymphocytes, however, the virus growth cycle is abortive, and the EBV persists in the B lymphocyte in a partially replicated state for the life of the cell. Even though the virus growth in the B cell is incomplete, the lymphocyte is permanently altered by the infectious processâ€”i.e., B cells can take on growth characteristics that resemble those of cancerous lymphocytes. The affected B lymphocytes can multiply excessively to produce a cancer of the lymphatic system.
