Well-watered from natural springs, the area was settled in early times. From the 8th century bce it was the site of Lixia, a major city of the state of Qi, which flourished in the Zhou period (1046–256 bce). Later, in the 2nd century bce, the town became the seat of Licheng county in the commandery (district controlled by a commander) of Jinan. The Chinese name Jinan (“South of the Ji”) came from the Ji River, which formerly flowed along what is now the lower course of the Huang He. The seat of the commandery was shifted to the present city at the beginning of the 4th century ce.
