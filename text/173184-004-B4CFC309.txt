Jonathan Winters, in full Jonathan Harshman Winters III  (born November 11, 1925, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.—died April 11, 2013, Montecito, California) American comedian who used sound effects, facial contortions, a gift for mimicry, and breakneck improvisational skills to entertain nightclub, radio, television, and film audiences. He was once described by talk-show host Jack Paar as “pound for pound, the funniest man alive.”
The son and grandson of Midwestern bankers, Winters spent most of his childhood with his divorced mother, a Springfield, Ohio, radio personality. At an early age he developed a facility for imitating movie sound effects, which matured into a talent for mimicry and improvisation. After serving with the U.S. Marines during World War II, he attended the Dayton Art Institute for two years. Although he hoped to pursue a career as a cartoonist, he held down a variety of unusual jobs (including a stint in an incubator factory) before trying his luck in show business.
