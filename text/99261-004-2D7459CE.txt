Thea Musgrave,  (born May 27, 1928, Barnton, Edinburgh, Scot.) Scottish composer best known for her dramatic concerti, operas, choral works, and chamber music.
Musgrave studied for three years at the University of Edinburgh, taking premedical courses; she also took music courses at the university and eventually received a Bachelor of Music degree (1950). From 1950 to 1954 she studied in Paris, chiefly with Nadia Boulanger. In 1953 her first commission, Suite o’ Bairnsangs (for voice and piano), was performed in Braemar, Scot., followed the next year by a Scottish BBC performance of Cantata for a Summer’s Day. These and other early works were chiefly diatonic and suggestive of Scottish or medieval themes. Soon she turned to chromaticism and, later, serialism, producing the Piano Sonata (1956), String Quartet (1958), and other chamber works.
