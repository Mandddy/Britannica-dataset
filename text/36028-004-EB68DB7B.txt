Labeo,  any of numerous species of African and Asian river fishes belonging to the genus Labeo in the carp family, Cyprinidae. Labeos have a thick-lipped, sucking mouth on the underside of the head and two to four small mouth barbels. They are bottom feeders and eat algae and small animals. The rohu (L. rohita) of India is esteemed for food and sport and is cultured in ponds. Several African labeos are also valued game fishes, among them L. altivelis, a central and southern African species weighing up to 3 kg (6.5 pounds).
Two Asian species of Labeo are familiar to home aquarists: the red-tailed black “shark” (L. bicolor) and the black “shark” (L., or Morulius, chrysophekadion). The former, about 12 cm (5 inches) long, is black with a bright red tail; the latter is totally black and grows to about 30 cm in aquariums. The fishes are called “shark” for their appearance.
