Infrared source, in astronomy, any of various celestial objects that radiate measurable quantities of energy in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such objects include the Sun and the planets, certain stars, nebulae, and galaxies. A number of known infrared sources can be observed at the wavelengths of visible light and in certain cases at radio and X-ray wavelengths as well.
The Sun emits roughly half its energy in the form of infrared rays, with the rest mainly as visible light. Its radiation heats up the planets and renders them bright infrared sources. Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune also have their own internal heat source, which doubles their infrared brightness.
