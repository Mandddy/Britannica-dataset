Aggressive behaviour, animal behaviour that involves actual or potential harm to another animal. Biologists commonly distinguish between two types of aggressive behaviour: predatory or antipredatory aggression, in which animals prey upon or defend themselves from other animals of different species, and intraspecific aggression, in which animals attack members of their own species. Intraspecific aggression is widespread across the animal kingdom, being seen in creatures as diverse as sea anemones, rag worms, wolf spiders, field crickets, lobsters, salmon, tree frogs, lizards, songbirds, rats, and chimpanzees. Given that so many different kinds of animals fight, aggression takes a variety of forms. Sea anemones lash at one another with tentacles armed with stinging cells, rag worms batter each other with the proboscises that they use for digging burrows, lobsters use their large claws for hitting and grasping, tree frogs wrestle, robins peck, red deer use their antlers to push and batter one another, and one chimpanzee, made famous through the work of British behavioral scientist Jane Goodall, intimidated rivals by banging two oilcans together. Usually just two or a few individuals participate in fights, but there are cases in which larger groups of animals are involved. Spectacular examples are the lethal fights that take place between neighbouring ant colonies in the spring and the killing raids by coalitions of male chimpanzees against smaller neighbouring groups.
This article follows the common practice of biologists by considering only intraspecific attacks under the title aggressive behaviour. The emphasis here is on biological contextâ€”that is, the roots of aggression in competition for food and mates; the influences of the nervous system, hormones, genetics, and environment; and scientific models for analyzing the likely outcome of aggressive interactions.
