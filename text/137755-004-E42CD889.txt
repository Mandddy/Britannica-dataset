Parnaíba River, Portuguese Rio Parnaíba,  river, northeastern Brazil, rising in the Serra da Tabatinga and flowing north-northeastward for 1,056 mi (1,700 km) to empty into the Atlantic Ocean, forming a delta at its mouth. In addition to marking the border between the states of Maranhão and Piauí, the Parnaíba has great economic importance. Although its middle and upper reaches are interrupted by waterfalls, it is navigable by shallow-draft vessels from its mouth at least as far south as the junction of the Rio Canindé. Important river ports include Piauí’s three major cities, Teresina (the state capital), Floriano, and Parnaíba.
