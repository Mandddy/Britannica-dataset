The University of Illinois was one of the land-grant universities created by the Morrill Act of 1862. It was chartered as Illinois Industrial University in 1867; instruction began the following year in Urbana-Champaign. The universityâ€™s presence in Chicago began with the founding of the school of pharmacy and the department of medicine in 1894 and 1897, respectively. An undergraduate division of the university opened in Chicago in 1946. Nearly 20 years later the university had a new campus constructed west of downtown Chicago; this campus was known as the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. In 1982 Chicago Circle merged with the University of Illinois at the Medical Center to form the University of Illinois at Chicago. The Springfield campus began as Sangamon State University in 1969 and became part of the University of Illinois system in 1995. The university library in Urbana-Champaign, with more than 22 million items, is the largest public university collection in the world. From 1923 to 1925 legendary running back Red Grange starred on the Illinois gridiron football team, bringing national attention to the university.
