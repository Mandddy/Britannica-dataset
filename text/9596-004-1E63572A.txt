Jean Renoir,  (born Sept. 15, 1894, Paris, Franceâ€”died  Feb. 12, 1979, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) French film director, son of the Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. His films, in both silent and later eras, were noted for their realism and strong narrative and include such classics as Grand Illusion (1937), The Rules of the Game (1939), and The River (1951).
Renoir was born in the Montmartre section of Paris; in an environment in which art predominated, among painters and their models, he spent a happy childhood, which was richer in the carefree appreciation of beauty than in formal studies. Nevertheless, he received a degree in 1913 from the University of Aix-en-Provence, where he wrote poetry, and joined the cavalry to begin a military career.
