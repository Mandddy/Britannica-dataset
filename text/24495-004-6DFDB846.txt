João de Deus,  (born March 8, 1830, São Bartolomeu de Messines, Algarve, Portugal—died January 11, 1896, Lisbon) lyric poet who fashioned a simple, direct, and expressive language that revitalized Portuguese Romantic poetry. He was a major influence on Portuguese literature of the early 20th century.
As a student at Coimbra, Deus led a bohemian life and spent much time composing poems that he read aloud to his friends. Many of his lyrics were salvaged by his friends and printed in reviews. He graduated in the faculty of law in 1859 after taking 10 years to complete a 5-year course, but he remained in Coimbra until 1862, an influential figure among the younger poets who were to break with the literary formalism of the period. Though his first collection of poems, Flores do Campo (1868; “Wildflowers”), was well received, he was constantly in financial difficulties. His friends succeeded in having him elected to Parliament in 1869, but he renounced his office over a question of principle, a gesture that brought him great popularity but little material comfort. After his marriage he was forced to eke out a living by composing verses on commission for tradesmen and by doing menial jobs. During this period he devoted himself to developing a new method of teaching reading. His second volume of verse, Fôlhas Sôltas (“Loose Leaves”), and his Cartilha Maternal (“Maternal Primer”) both appeared in 1876. His reading method was officially adopted in 1888, and he was appointed to introduce it. He was by that time a famous man. His collected works, Campo de Flores (“Field of Flowers”), were published in 1893; two years later he was publicly proclaimed the greatest Portuguese poet of his generation.
