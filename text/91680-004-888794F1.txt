Andre Norton, original name Alice Mary Norton  (born February 17, 1912, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—died March 17, 2005, Murfreesboro, Tennessee) prolific best-selling American author of science-fiction and fantasy adventure novels for both juveniles and adults.
Norton entered Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in 1930 but two years later began an 18-year career as a children’s librarian at the Cleveland (Ohio) Public Library. She legally changed her name to Andre Norton in 1934, when her historical fantasy The Prince Commands was published; it was the first of eight novels that she published while working as a librarian. Among her early novels was an espionage trilogy about the Dutch underground during World War II, consisting of The Sword Is Drawn (1944), Sword in Sheath (1949), and At Swords’ Point (1954). While working for the science-fiction publisher Gnome Press in the 1950s, she first tried her hand at science fiction, producing Star Man’s Son, 2250 A.D. (1952); it was reprinted in paperback as Daybreak—2250 A.D. and sold more than a million copies.
