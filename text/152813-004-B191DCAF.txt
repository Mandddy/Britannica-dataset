Red River, also called Red River of the South,  navigable river rising in the high plains of eastern New Mexico, U.S., and flowing southeast across Texas and Louisiana to a point northwest of Baton Rouge, where it enters the Atchafalaya River, which flows south to Atchafalaya Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Until the mid-20th century, the Red River contributed flow to both the Atchafalaya and, via the Old River, the Mississippi. With the construction of a flood-control system on the Old River, however, the Red River ceased to act as a tributary of the Mississippi. The Red River drains an area of some 93,000 square miles (241,000 square km).
The Red River is 1,290 miles (2,080 km) long; for about half this distance, it serves as the Texas-Oklahoma boundary. Its principal tributaries are the North Fork of the Red, the Kiamichi, Little, Black (Ouachita), Pease, Sulphur, Wichita, and Washita rivers and Bodcau and Cypress bayous.
