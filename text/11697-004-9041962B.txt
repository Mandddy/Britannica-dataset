Freshwater sponge,  any of about 20 species of the genus Spongilla (class Demospongiae, siliceous sponges), a common, widely occurring group. Spongilla species are found in clean lake waters and slow streams.
Freshwater sponges are delicate in structure, growing as encrusting or branching masses. They usually appear greenish because of the algae that live on them. Freshwater sponges may attain a volume of more than 2,500 cubic centimetres (150 cubic inches). The larva of the spongillafly lives as a parasite on freshwater sponges.
