Battle of Monocacy, (July 9, 1864), American Civil War engagement fought on the banks of the Monocacy River near Frederick, Maryland, in which Confederate troops under Lieutenant General Jubal A. Early routed Union forces under Major General Lewis Wallace. Although the Union forces were defeated, the delay caused by the battle gave General Ulysses S. Grant time to send reinforcements for the defense of Washington, D.C. Of 6,050 Federal troops in the engagement, some 1,300 were killed, wounded, or missing in action. Of 14,000 Confederates involved, there were about 700 casualties.
Early left Richmond on June 13 under orders from General Robert E. Lee to drive Union forces out of the Shenandoah Valley and, in Early’s words, to “threaten” Washington. Early took his II Corps west to Lynchburg, Virginia, where he routed Union troops under Major General David Hunter. Early then moved north through the Shenandoah Valley. Picking up cavalry troops along the way, the Confederate force crossed the Potomac River into Maryland on July 5.
