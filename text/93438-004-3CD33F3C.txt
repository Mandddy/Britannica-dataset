Writers Adolph Green and Betty Comden discovered that MGM had a cache of many wonderful but unheralded songs featured in the studio’s films from the early sound era. This inspired them to use these tunes as the basis of a screenplay about the trials and tribulations endured by people in the film industry when sound was introduced, a process that made plenty of new stars while destroying many established ones. Kelly portrayed a studio star who falls in love with an aspiring actress, played by Debbie Reynolds. Her lovely voice wins her a place opposite him in the new “talkie” films, pushing aside his screechy-toned leading lady, played by Jean Hagen.
