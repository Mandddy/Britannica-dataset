Bing Crosby, byname of Harry Lillis Crosby   (born May 3, 1903, Tacoma, Wash., U.S.—died  Oct. 14, 1977, near Madrid, Spain) American singer, actor, and songwriter who achieved great popularity in radio, recordings, and motion pictures. He became the archetypal crooner of a period when the advent of radio broadcasting and talking pictures and the refinement of sound-recording techniques made the climate ideal for the rise of such a figure. His casual stage manner and mellow, relaxed singing style influenced two generations of pop singers and made him the most successful entertainer of his day.
Crosby began to sing and to play the drums while studying law at Spokane, Wash. After a period spent singing with the Paul Whiteman orchestra in 1927, he appeared in the early sound film King of Jazz (1931). Crosby became a star after getting his own program on the CBS radio station in New York City in 1932. He began appearing in more films, and by the late 1930s his records were selling millions of copies. His songwriting activities included part-authorship of “A Ghost of a Chance” and “Where the Blue of the Night” (his radio theme song). His recording of “White Christmas” became one of the most popular songs of the century, exceeded in record sales only by his “Silent Night.” In the 1940s he was the star of a popular radio variety show. Crosby won an Academy Award for best actor for his portrayal of Father O’Malley in the film Going My Way (1944).
