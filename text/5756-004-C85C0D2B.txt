Leochares,  (flourished 4th century bc) Greek sculptor to whom the Apollo Belvedere (Roman copy, Vatican Museum) is often attributed. About 353–c. 350 bc Leochares worked with Scopas on the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Most of his attributions are from ancient records. The base of a statue inscribed with his name, however, was found in Athens. This work, a bronze lion hunt of Alexander, was executed by Leochares and Lysippus at Delphi. He was commissioned by King Philip of Macedon to produce gold and ivory statues of the king’s family, which were installed in the Philippeum at Olympia about 338 bc. The Vatican statuette of Ganymede and the Eagle is thought to be a copy of a work by Leochares.
