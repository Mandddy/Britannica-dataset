Viper (family Viperidae), any of more than 200 species of venomous snakes belonging to two groups: pit vipers (subfamily Crotalinae) and Old World vipers (subfamily Viperinae), which are considered separate families by some authorities. They eat small animals and hunt by striking and envenomating their prey. Vipers are characterized by a pair of long, hollow, venom-injecting fangs attached to movable bones of the upper jaw (the maxillaries) that are folded back in the mouth when not in use. Their eyes have vertical pupils, and their scales are keeled. Vipers range in length from less than 25 cm (10 inches) in the Namaqua dwarf viper (Bitis schneideri) of southern Africa to more than 3 metres (10 feet) in the bushmaster (Lachesis muta) of the Amazon basin and Central America.
The pit vipers are found from desert to rainforest, primarily in the New World. This group includes copperheads, rattlesnakes, and fer-de-lances (genera Bothrops and Trimeresurus), among others. They may be terrestrial or arboreal. Some, such as the moccasins (genus Agkistrodon), are aquatic. Except for the egg-laying bushmaster, all pit vipers are live-bearers (viviparous).
