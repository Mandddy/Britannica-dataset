Rouben Mamoulian,  (born October 8, 1897, Tiflis, Georgia, Russian Empire [now Tbilisi, Georgia]—died December 4, 1987, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) Georgian-born American theatrical and motion-picture director noted for his contribution to the development of cinematic art at the beginning of the sound era. His achievements included the skillful blending of music and sound effects with an imaginative visual rhythm. Dividing his professional life between Hollywood and the theatre, Mamoulian directed only 17 films between 1929, when he made Applause, and 1957, when he returned from a long hiatus to make Silk Stockings, yet his limited body of work was so stylish, deft, and imaginative that he left an indelible mark on film history. In between he enjoyed an active career as one of Broadway’s leading directors.
Mamoulian grew up in an ethnic Armenian family in imperial Russian Georgia. His father was a banker, and his mother was active in the theatre. While studying criminal law at the University of Moscow, he became involved in the theatre, training at the Moscow Art Theatre under Yevgeny Bagrationovich Vakhtangov, a disciple of Konstantin Stanislavsky. In 1918 Mamoulian founded a drama studio in Tiflis (now Tbilisi). In 1920 he toured with the Russian Repertory Company to England, where he remained in order to escape the Soviet regime and to study drama at the University of London. He began directing English stage productions in 1922 and then immigrated to the United States in 1923, where for several years he directed grand operas and operettas at the Eastman Theatre in Rochester, New York.
