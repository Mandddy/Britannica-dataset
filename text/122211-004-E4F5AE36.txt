King Kong, landmark American monster film, released in 1933, that was noted for its pioneering special effects by Willis O’Brien. It was the first significant feature film to star an animated character and also made actress Fay Wray an international star.
Director Carl Denham (played by Robert Armstrong) leads a film crew to a remote, uncharted Pacific island in search of the legendary Kong, a gigantic ape. After the island’s inhabitants abandon actress Ann Darrow (Wray) to Kong, Denham and his crew pursue the beast through the dinosaur-infested jungle. They eventually capture Kong and take him to New York as a sideshow attraction, with disastrous results. The climax of the film, when Kong climbs the Empire State Building while clutching a terrified Ann, is one of the most famous in film history. Kong safely places Ann aside and then battles machine-gun fire from swarming planes, which mortally wound him and cause him to plunge to his death. Denham then utters the film’s signature lines: “Oh, no. It wasn’t the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.”
