Taxicab,  chauffeur-driven automobile available for hire to carry passengers between any two points within a city or its suburbs for a fare determined by a meter or zone system or a flat rate. The taxicab is named after the taximeter, an instrument invented by Wilhelm Bruhn in 1891 that automatically recorded the distance traveled and/or the time consumed, thus enabling the fare to be accurately measured. The term cab derives from the cabriolet, a two-wheeled, one-horse carriage often let out for hire.
The development of modern taxicabs closely parallels that of automobiles. The first motorized taxicabs were electric-powered vehicles that began appearing on the streets of European and American cities in the late 1890s. Internal combustion-powered taxicabs equipped with taximeters first appeared around 1907 and have dominated taxi travel ever since. Most modern taxis are four-door passenger cars that are especially fitted for taxicab service and provided with modifications designed to withstand the more severe service requirements of taxi operation. Such modifications include reinforced auto-body frames, heavier springs and shock absorbers in the suspension system, and more reliable engine charging. In some cities, such as London, taxicab design must meet legally approved specifications.
