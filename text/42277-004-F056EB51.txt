Seagram Building, high-rise office building in New York City (1958). Designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, this sleek Park Avenue skyscraper is a pure example of a rectilinear prism sheathed in glass and bronze. It took the International Style to its zenith. Despite its austere and forthright use of the most modern materials, it demonstrates Miesâ€™s exceptional sense of proportion and concern for detail.
