Mary Abby Van Kleeck,  (born June 26, 1883, Glenham, N.Y., U.S.—died June 8, 1972, Kingston, N.Y.) American social researcher and reformer, a dynamic and influential figure in the investigation and improvement of labour conditions in the first half of the 20th century.
Van Kleeck, the daughter of a minister, received her bachelor’s degree from Smith College in 1904 and joined the College Settlements Association, where she began her career as a social researcher by studying New York City’s female factory workers and child labourers. For decades she served as director of the Russell Sage Foundation’s department of industrial studies, where her work and that of her colleagues helped bring about legislative reform by shedding light on the conditions in various trades. By then an expert on women’s employment, during World War I van Kleeck set the War Labor Policies Board standards for women working in the war industries and was appointed head of the Women in Industry Service agency established within the Department of Labor. This agency later became the United States Women’s Bureau.
