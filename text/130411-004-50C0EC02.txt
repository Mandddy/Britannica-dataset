Miguel López de Legazpi,  (born c. 1510, Zumárraga, Spain—died  Aug. 20, 1572, Manila, Phil.) Spanish explorer who established Spain’s dominion over the Philippines that lasted until the Spanish-American War of 1898.
Legazpi went to New Spain (Mexico) in 1545, serving for a time as clerk in the local government. Although Ferdinand Magellan had discovered the Philippine archipelago in 1521, no European settlements had been made there, so Luis de Velasco, the viceroy of New Spain, sent Legazpi to claim it in 1564. He left Acapulco with five ships and reached Cebu, one of the southern islands of the archipelago, in April 1565, founding the first Spanish settlement on the site of modern Cebu City.
