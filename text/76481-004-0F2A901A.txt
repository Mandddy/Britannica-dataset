For Whom the Bell Tolls, American adventure film, released in 1943, that was a romanticized adaptation of the 1940 novel of the same name by Ernest Hemingway. The film was a popular and critical success, earning nine Academy Award nominations and winning one for best supporting actress (Katina Paxinou).
Young American idealist schoolteacher Robert Jordan (played by Gary Cooper) joins the Republican brigade in Spain, battling fascist Nationalist armies during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) and serving as a dynamiter. He is attached to a guerrilla band tasked with the dangerous mission of blowing up a strategic bridge. Jordan meets and falls in love with María (Ingrid Bergman), a young woman ravaged and left traumatized by fascist troops. The drunken guerrilla leader, Pablo (Akim Tamiroff), resents Jordan’s affection for María and initially refuses to help him, whereupon Pablo’s wife, Pilar (Paxinou), steps in to aid Jordan in completing the mission. Pablo eventually relents, and the others detonate the explosives, destroying the bridge. Several of their comrades are lost in battle, and then Jordan is wounded while attempting to escape on horseback. Knowing he will not be able to accompany his friends, Jordan dies heroically, staying behind to cover their escape with machine-gun fire.
