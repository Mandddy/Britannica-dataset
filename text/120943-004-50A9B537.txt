Qishon River, also spelled Kishon River, Hebrew Naẖal Qishon,  stream, northern Israel, one of the country’s few perennial rivers. It is formed by small streams and seasonal watercourses (wadis), which rise chiefly in the Hare (Mountains of) Gilboaʿ to the south and west and the Nazareth Hills of Lower Galilee to the north. From the river’s southern sources the Qishon’s total length is about 25 miles (40 km); the area of the drainage basin is about 400 square miles (1,000 square km).
The Qishon’s headwaters unite in the western Plain of Esdraelon, southwest of kibbutz Sarid. There a dam has been built, impounding a 3-mile-long, multipurpose (flood control, irrigation, fishpond) reservoir, Agam Kefar Barukh. Before this was constructed by Jewish settlers, the Qishon overflowed its banks annually during the winter rains and hindered settlement in the surrounding area. From there the river flows northwest through the plain, is deflected north by the Mount Carmel ridge, and resumes a northwesterly course through the plain of ʿAkko (Acre) to the Mediterranean Sea in the Bay of Haifa.
