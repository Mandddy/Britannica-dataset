Sanaa, Arabic Ṣanʿāʾ or Sana,  city, capital of Yemen. It is situated at the western foot of Mount Nuqum, at an elevation of more than 7,200 feet (2,200 metres) above sea level, in the western part of the country. Sanaa has for many centuries been the chief economic, political, and religious centre of the Yemen Highlands. The city’s name means “fortified place.”
Sanaa is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, although an exact date for its establishment is unknown. According to Yemeni legend, it was founded by Shem, one of the three sons of Noah. It occupies the site of the ancient pre-Islamic stronghold of Ghumdān, which may date to the 1st and 2nd century bce. Sanaa was an Arabian centre for Christians and Jews before it was converted to Islam by ʿAlī, fourth caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, in 632 ce. The city’s history as a Muslim centre is one of sporadic rivalry between the heterodox Zaydī (see Zaydiyyah) imams (leaders) and rival dynasties; the Zaydī imamate, whose original capital was at Ṣaʿdah in the north, lasted, with frequent interruptions, from the 9th century to 1962. There was a sharp decline in the city’s fortunes in the 12th–15th century, as successive conquerors of Yemen set up their capitals in other cities. During the reign of ʿAbd al-Wahhāb ibn Ṭāhir of the Ṭāhirid dynasty in the early 16th century the city was embellished with many fine mosques and madrassas (Islamic theological schools).
