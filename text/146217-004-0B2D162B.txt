Tony Curtis, original name Bernard Schwartz  (born June 3, 1925, Bronx, New York, U.S.â€”died September 29, 2010, Henderson, Nevada) American actor whose handsome looks first propelled him to fame in the 1950s.
Schwartz grew up in the Bronx, where he experienced a troubled home life and became a member of a notorious street gang. After serving in the navy during World War II, he studied drama and briefly appeared on Broadway before going in 1949 to Hollywood, where he adopted the name Tony Curtis. He acted in adventure films, such as The Prince Who Was a Thief (1951), and many of his early movies were panned. However, he earned acclaim for his performances in Houdini (1953), as Harry Houdini; Trapeze (1956), as an aerialist; and Sweet Smell of Success (1957), as an unprincipled press agent. In The Defiant Ones (1958), his portrayal of an escaped prisoner chained to a black convict (played by Sidney Poitier) earned Curtis his only Academy Award nomination.
