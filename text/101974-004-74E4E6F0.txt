Pierre-François-Charles Augereau, duke de Castiglione,  (born October 21, 1757, Paris, France—died June 12, 1816, La Houssaye) army officer whose military ability won for France a series of brilliant victories in Italy under Napoleon’s command.
The son of a poor Parisian servant, Augereau turned to a military career at the age of 17, served in several foreign armies, and returned to France in 1792. He quickly advanced in rank and by 1793 was general of a division stationed in the eastern Pyrenees. In 1795 his division served in the Italian campaign, and his victory at Castiglione (August 5, 1796) convinced Napoleon of his indispensability. He carried out the coup d’état of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) and was elected a deputy and secretary of the Assembly in 1799. Augereau opposed Napoleon’s coup d’état of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799) and was consequently given unimportant commands from 1800 to 1805. Yet he was appointed a marshal of France in 1804.
