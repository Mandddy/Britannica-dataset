Rudolf II,  (born July 18, 1552, Vienna, Habsburg domain [now in Austria]—died January 20, 1612, Prague, Bohemia [now in Czech Republic]) Holy Roman emperor from 1576 to 1612. His ill health and unpopularity prevented him from restraining the religious dissensions that eventually led to the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48).
The eldest surviving son of the emperor Maximilian II and Maria, who was the daughter of the emperor Charles V, Rudolf was crowned king of Hungary in 1572 (as Rudolf) and of Bohemia in 1575 (as Rudolf II). He succeeded his father as emperor and as archduke of Austria (as Rudolf V) on October 12, 1576.
