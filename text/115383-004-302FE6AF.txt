Crown gall,  disease of plants caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Thousands of plant species are susceptible; they include especially rose, grape, pome and stone fruits, shade and nut trees, many shrubs and vines, and perennial garden plants. Symptoms include roundish, rough-surfaced galls, several inches or more in diameter, usually at or near the soil line, graft or bud union, or on roots and lower stems. The galls, at first cream coloured or greenish, later turn brown or black. As the disease progresses, plants lose vigour and may eventually die.
Crown gall can be avoided by using nursery stock free of suspicious bumps near the crown, former soil line, or graft union; practicing five-year rotation or avoiding replanting for that period; removing severely infected plants (including as many roots as possible); protecting against injury; keeping down weeds; controlling root-chewing insects and nematodes; cutting away large galls on trees, and disinfecting the wounds.
