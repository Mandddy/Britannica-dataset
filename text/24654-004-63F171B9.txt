Stephen J. Field, in full Stephen Johnson Field  (born November 4, 1816, Haddam, Connecticut, U.S.—died April 9, 1899, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and chief architect of the constitutional approach that largely exempted the rapidly expanding industry of the United States from governmental regulation after the Civil War. He found the judicial instrument for the protection of private enterprise principally in the Fourteenth Amendment (1868), which had been passed as a civil rights measure. In his interpretation, the privileges and immunities of citizens secured by the amendment included the right to run a business without government interference, a view that prevailed in the court from the 1890s until the 1930s.
A graduate of Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts (1837), Field practiced law in New York City with one of his brothers, the legal reformer David Dudley Field. In 1849 he went to California, where he bought land in the Sacramento River gold-mining area, organized a town government, and became a state legislator and (in 1857) a state supreme court justice. Appointed by President Abraham Lincoln, Field sat on the U.S. Supreme Court from March 10, 1863, until December 1, 1897, the second longest service in the court’s history (after that of William O. Douglas).
