Freshwater snail, any of the approximately 5,000 snail species that live in lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams. Most are members of the subclass Pulmonata, which also includes the terrestrial snails and slugs, but some are members of the subclass Prosobranchia; both subclasses belong to the class Gastropoda. The southeastern United States has the greatest number of species; another notable location is Lake Tanganyika, in Africa.
Freshwater snails are dispersed between isolated bodies of water via birdsâ€™ feet, wind-blown leaves, and floods. Several species are hosts to a variety of parasitic flatworm species (called trematodes) that cause disease in humans and other warm-blooded animals; e.g., schistosomiasis. Some species (e.g., the amphibious snail Ampullarius gigas) are used to keep aquariums clean.
