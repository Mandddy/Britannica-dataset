Horace Wells,  (born Jan. 21, 1815, Hartford, Vt., U.S.—died Jan. 24, 1848, New York, N.Y.) American dentist, a pioneer in the use of surgical anesthesia.
While practicing in Hartford, Conn., in 1844, Wells noted the pain-killing properties of nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) during a laughing-gas road show and thereafter used it in performing painless dental operations. He was allowed to demonstrate the method at the Massachusetts General Hospital in January 1845, but when the patient proved unresponsive to the gas, Wells was exposed to ridicule.
