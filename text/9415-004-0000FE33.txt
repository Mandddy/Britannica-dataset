Shad,  any of several saltwater food fishes of the herring family (Clupeidae) that swim up rivers to spawn. Shad of the genus Alosa are rather deep bodied and have a notch in the upper jaw into which the tip of the lower fits. Young shad have small teeth, but the adults are toothless. The flesh of these fishes is considered very good to eat, though bony; the eggs, or roe, are a delicacy in the United States.
The American shad (Alosa sapidissima), formerly found only on the Atlantic coast from Florida to Newfoundland, was introduced into the Pacific Ocean in 1871 and now ranges from San Diego to British Columbia. It is a migratory plankton eater and evidently enters deep water in fall. A good game fish, it may be 75 cm (30 inches) long. Young shad hatch in 6 to 15 days, enter the sea in fall, and mature in about three years.
