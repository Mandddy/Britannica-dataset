Aurelian Wall, Italian Mura Aureliane,  rampart of imperial Rome, first constructed in the second half of the 3rd century ad. It was begun by the emperor Aurelian, completed by his successor Probus, improved under the emperor Honorius in the early 5th century, and restored by Theodoric the Great in the 6th century and by several medieval popes.
It was originally constructed of tufa concrete, with a facing of triangular bricks. It was about 12.5 miles (20 km) long and about 13 feet (4 m) thick. Originally the walls stood 24 feet (7.2 m) high but were raised by Flavius Stilicho, the great general of the emperor Honorius, to a height of 35 feet (10.6 m) and reinforced by 380 towers standing about 100 feet (30 m) apart. There were 16 gates in the circuit. Much of the wall still survives.
