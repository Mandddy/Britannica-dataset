Michael, Russian in full Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov   (born July 22 [July 12, old style], 1596—died  July 23 [July 13, O.S.], 1645, Moscow) tsar of Russia from 1613 to 1645 and founder of the Romanov dynasty, which ruled Russia until 1917.
Son of Fyodor Nikitich Romanov (later the Orthodox patriarch Philaret), Michael was related to the last tsar of the Rurik dynasty, Fyodor I (reigned 1584–98) through his grandfather Nikita Romanov, who was Fyodor’s maternal uncle. When the zemsky sobor (assembly of the land) met in 1613 to elect a new tsar after the Time of Troubles—a period of chaotic internal disorders, foreign invasions, and a rapid succession of rulers following the death of Fyodor I—it chose Michael Romanov as tsar (February 1613).
