George Franklin Edmunds,  (born Feb. 1, 1828, Richmond, Vt., U.S.—died  Feb. 27, 1919, Pasadena, Calif.) U.S. senator and constitutional lawyer, who for a quarter of a century was a participant in the most important legislative developments of the time.
Edmunds received little formal education, but he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1849. He was a Republican member (1854–59) and speaker (1856–59) of the Vermont House of Representatives and a member and president pro tem (1861–62) of the Vermont Senate. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1866 and served until 1891; he was president pro tem of the Senate (1883–85). Edmunds was active in the impeachment (1868) of President Andrew Johnson, was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee (1872–79; 1882–91), and was a founding member of the electoral commission that decided the election of 1876. The act for the suppression of polygamy (1882) bears his name, and he was principal author of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (1890), which he insisted be so worded that it would be applicable to labour unions as well as to industry.
