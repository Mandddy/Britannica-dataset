Navy, a nationâ€™s warships and craft of every kind maintained for fighting on, under, or over the sea. A large modern navy includes aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, submarines, minesweepers and minelayers, gunboats, and various types of support, supply, and repair ships, as well as naval bases and ports. There is also, necessarily, a vast organization for the administration and upkeep of these warships. Naval ships are the chief means by which a nation extends its military power onto the seas. Their two chief functions are to achieve sea control and sea denial. Control of the sea enables a nation and its allies to carry on maritime commerce, amphibious assaults, and other seaborne operations that may be essential in wartime. Denial of the sea deprives enemy merchant vessels and warships of safe navigation of the seas.
A brief historical treatment of Western navies follows. For full treatment of the history, types, and technological development of naval ships and craft, see War, Technology of: Naval ships and craft. For the history of naval tactics and strategy, see War, Theory and Conduct of: Naval tactics.
