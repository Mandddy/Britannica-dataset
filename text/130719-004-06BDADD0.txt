Gabija, Lithuanian gabieta, Latvian uguns māte, Old Prussian panicke,  in Baltic religion, the domestic hearth fire. In pre-Christian times a holy fire (šventa ugnis) was kept in tribal sanctuaries on high hills and riverbanks, where priests guarded it constantly, extinguishing and rekindling it once a year at the midsummer festival. Eventually this tradition was moved into the home as the gabija, and its care became the responsibility of the mistress of the house. Every evening she carefully tended the fire lest it go out and then prayed to it to ensure the family’s good fortune. During wedding ceremonies the bride was given a fire from her mother’s hearth in order that the gabija might provide an auspicious beginning for the new family.
