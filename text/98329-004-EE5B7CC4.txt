Peptic ulcer, lesion that occurs primarily in the mucous membrane of the stomach or duodenum (the upper segment of the small intestine); it is produced when external factors reduce the ability of the mucosal lining to resist the acidic effects of gastric juice (a mixture of digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid). Until recently the factors responsible for peptic ulcers remained unclear; a stressful lifestyle and rich diet commonly were blamed. Evidence now indicates that infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the two major causes of peptic ulcer.
Between 10 and 15 percent of the worldâ€™s population suffers from peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcers, which account for 80 percent of peptic ulcers, are more common in men than in women, but stomach ulcers affect women more frequently. The symptoms of gastric and duodenal ulcer are similar and include a gnawing, burning ache and hungerlike pain in the mid-upper abdomen, usually experienced from one to three hours after meals and several hours after retiring.
