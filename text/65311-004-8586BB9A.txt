Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), one of two species of North American venomous lizards in the genus Heloderma of the family Helodermatidae. The Gila monster (H. suspectum) was named for the Gila River Basin and occurs in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It grows to about 50 cm (about 20 inches), is stout-bodied with black and pink blotches or bands, and has beadlike scales. A closely related species, the Mexican beaded lizard (H. horridum), is slightly larger (to 80 cm [about 32 inches]) and darker but otherwise similar in appearance.
During warm weather the Gila monster feeds at night on small mammals, birds, and eggs (see video). Fat stored in the tail and abdomen at this time is utilized during the winter months. Both species of Heloderma are slow, methodical predators. Their large heads and muscular jaws yield a strong bite that is held while venom seeps into the wound. Many teeth have two grooves that conduct the venom, a nerve poison, from glands in the lower jaw. Fatalities to humans are rare.
