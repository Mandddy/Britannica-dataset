Hemolysis, also spelled haemolysis, also called hematolysis,  breakdown or destruction of red blood cells so that the contained oxygen-carrying pigment hemoglobin is freed into the surrounding medium.
Hemolysis occurs normally in a small percentage of red blood cells as a means of removing aged cells from the bloodstream and freeing heme for iron recycling. It also can be induced by exercise.
