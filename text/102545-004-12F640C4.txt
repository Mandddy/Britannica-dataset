Plow, also spelled plough,  most important agricultural implement since the beginning of history, used to turn and break up soil, to bury crop residues, and to help control weeds.
The antecedent of the plow is the prehistoric digging stick. The earliest plows were doubtless digging sticks fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing. By Roman times, light, wheelless plows with iron shares (blades) were drawn by oxen; these implements could break up the topsoil of the Mediterranean regions but could not handle the heavier soils of northwestern Europe. The wheeled plow, at first drawn by oxen but later by horses, made possible the northward spread of European agriculture. The 18th-century addition of the moldboard, which turned the furrow slice cut by the plowshare, was an important advance. In the mid-19th century the black prairie soils of the American Midwest challenged the strength of the existing plow, and American mechanic John Deere invented the all-steel one-piece share and moldboard. The three-wheel sulky plow followed and, with the introduction of the gasoline engine, the tractor-drawn plow.
