Halling,  vigorous Norwegian folk dance for couples. The name derives from Hallingdal, a valley in southern Norway. Two or three males may dance in rivalry, performing difficult leaps, kicks, and other acrobatic stunts to demonstrate vigour and virility. The halling is one of a number of European folk dances—among them the Ukrainian hopak and the Alpine Schuhplattler—in which the male dancer shows off for his partner.
