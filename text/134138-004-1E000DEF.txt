Mary White Ovington,  (born April 11, 1865, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died July 15, 1951, Newton Highlands, Massachusetts) American civil rights activist, one of the white reformers who joined African Americans in founding the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Born three days before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Ovington was reared in an upper-middle-class home by abolitionist parents. Her beliefs in social reform and women’s rights were also shaped by the Reverend John White Chadwick of the Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Her studies at the Harvard Annex (later called Radcliffe College) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had already convinced her that social problems are attributable to economic class when the depression of 1893 necessitated her withdrawal from school. After working as registrar of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, she became head worker at a Pratt-sponsored settlement house, which she helped found. She became vice president of the Brooklyn chapter of the National Consumers League, whose aims were the elimination of child labour and tenement sweatshops through public education and enlightened state legislation, and she served as assistant secretary of the New York Social Reform Club.
