Byzantine art, architecture, paintings, and other visual arts produced in the Middle Ages in the Byzantine Empire (centred at Constantinople) and in various areas that came under its influence. The pictorial and architectural styles that characterized Byzantine art, first codified in the 6th century, persisted with remarkable homogeneity within the empire until its final dissolution with the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453.
A brief treatment of Byzantine art follows. For a treatment of Byzantine architecture, see Western architecture: The Christian East. For a treatment of Byzantine painting, see Western painting: Eastern Christian.
