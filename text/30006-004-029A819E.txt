William Lisle Bowles,  (born September 24, 1762, Kings Sutton, Northamptonshire, Englandâ€”died April 7, 1850, Salisbury, Wiltshire) English poet, critic, and clergyman, noted principally for his Fourteen Sonnets (1789), which expresses with simple sincerity the thoughts and feelings inspired in a mind of delicate sensibility by the contemplation of natural scenes.
Bowles was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was a pupil of Thomas Warton, and became an Anglican priest in 1792. His Fourteen Sonnets was enthusiastically received by the early Romantic poets, whose theory and practice it foreshadowed, and the work particularly influenced Samuel Taylor Coleridge. By 1794 the collection had been enlarged to 27 sonnets and 13 other poems. Bowles also published verse on political and religious topics: The Missionary (1813) is an attack on Spanish rule in South America. Days Departed; or, Banwell Hill (1828) is an eloquently reflective prospect poem (a subgenre of topographical poetry that considers a particular landscape as viewed from an elevated perspective).
