Kantianism, either the system of thought contained in the writings of the epoch-making 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant or those later philosophies that arose from the study of Kant’s writings and drew their inspiration from his principles. Only the latter is the concern of this article.
The Kantian movement comprises a loose assemblage of rather diverse philosophies that share Kant’s concern with exploring the nature, and especially the limits, of human knowledge in the hope of raising philosophy to the level of a science in some sense similar to mathematics and physics. Participating in the critical spirit and method of Kant, these philosophies are thus opposed to dogmatism, to expansive speculative naturalism (such as that of Benedict de Spinoza, the Dutch Jewish rationalist), and, usually, to irrationalism. The various submovements of Kantianism are characterized by their sharing of certain “family resemblances”—i.e., by the preoccupation of each with its own selection of concerns from among the many developments of Kant’s philosophy: a concern, for example, with the nature of empirical knowledge; with the way in which the mind imposes its own categorial structure upon experience, and, in particular, with the nature of the structure that renders human knowledge and moral action possible, a structure considered to be a priori (logically independent of experience); with the status of the Ding an sich (“thing-in-itself”), that more ultimate reality that presumably lurks behind the apprehension of an object; or with the relationship between knowledge and morality.
