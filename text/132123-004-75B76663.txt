Sophia Loren, original name Sofia Villani Scicolone  (born September 20, 1934, Rome, Italy) Italian film actress who rose above her poverty-stricken origins in postwar Naples to become universally recognized as one of Italyâ€™s most beautiful women and its most famous movie star.
Before working in the cinema, Sofia Scicolone changed her last name to Lazzaro for work in the foto-romanzo, popular pulp magazines that used still photographs to depict romantic stories. Her first film role was as an extra, one of many slave girls in the American production of Quo Vadis? (1951). Under the tutelage of producer Carlo Ponti (her future husband), Scicolone was transformed into Sophia Loren. Her career was launched in a series of low-budget comedies before she attracted critical and popular attention with Aida (1953), in which she lip-synched the singing of Renata Tebaldi in the title role.
