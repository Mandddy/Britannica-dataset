Edward MacDowell,  (born Dec. 18, 1860, New York City—died  Jan. 23, 1908, New York City) U.S. composer known especially for his piano pieces in smaller forms. As one of the first to incorporate native materials into his works, he helped establish an independent American musical idiom.
MacDowell first studied in New York with Teresa Carreño and then at the Conservatoire (1876–78) in Paris. In 1878 he went to Germany to study composition with Joachim Raff at the Frankfurt Conservatory and later taught piano at Darmstadt. In 1882 Raff introduced MacDowell to Liszt, who arranged for him to play his Modern Suite No. 1 at Zürich. In 1884 he went to the U.S., where he married his former pupil, Marian Nevins (1857–1956). He returned with her to Wiesbaden and remained there until 1887. The following year he settled in the U.S. In 1889 he played in New York City the first performance of his Second Piano Concerto in D Minor, his most successful larger work, one that retains popularity throughout the world.
