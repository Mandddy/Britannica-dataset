H. Saint John Philby, in full Harry Saint John Bridger Philby   (born April 3, 1885, Saint Johns, Badula, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]—died September 30, 1960, Beirut, Lebanon) British explorer and Arabist, the first European to cross the Rubʿ al-Khali, or Empty Quarter, of Arabia from east to west.
Philby was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and joined the Indian Civil Service in 1907. In 1917, as political officer of the Mesopotamian Expeditionary force, he was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Saʿūd. After meeting with the future king of Saudi Arabia, he crossed the desert from Al-ʿUqayr to Jidda—an exploit recorded in his book, Heart of Arabia (1922). Philby succeeded T.E. Lawrence as chief British representative in Transjordan (1921–24) but resigned to establish a business in Arabia. He was an unofficial adviser of Ibn Saʿūd and converted to Islam in 1930.
