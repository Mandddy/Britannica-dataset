In 1900 the industrialist Andrew Carnegie gave a gift of $1 million to the city of Pittsburgh for the creation of a technical school. Originally called Carnegie Technical Schools, it was renamed Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912. The institute merged with the Mellon Institute (established in 1913 in Pittsburgh by financier Andrew W. Mellon) in 1967. The university has built a reputation as a vital arts centre, operating three art galleries, two concert halls, and two theatres. The faculty has included Nobel Prize-winning economists Herbert Alexander Simon and Merton Miller.
