Live-bearer,  any of the numerous live-bearing topminnows of the family Poeciliidae (order Atheriniformes), found only in the New World and most abundantly in Mexico and Central America. Most of the many species are rather elongated, and all are small, the largest growing to only about 15 centimetres (6 inches) long.
Live-bearers resemble the related killifish (family Cyprinodontidae) but differ in their mode of reproduction and in the possession, by the males, of a specialized organ (gonopodium) derived from the anal fin and used to place the sperm in the body of the female. The family is also noted for the sometimes considerable differences between the sexes, the female often being larger and less brightly coloured. The young may number from a few to 100 or more, and several broods may result from one mating.
