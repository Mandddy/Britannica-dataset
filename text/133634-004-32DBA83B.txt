Noah H. Swayne, in full Noah Haynes Swayne   (born Dec. 7, 1804, Frederick county, Va., U.S.—died  June 8, 1884, New York, N.Y.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1862–81).
Swayne chose the law after briefly studying medicine and was admitted to the bar in 1823. He immediately moved from Virginia to Ohio because of his antislavery views and set up a successful practice at Coshocton. He was appointed county prosecuting attorney in 1826 and was elected to the legislature as a Jacksonian Democrat in 1829. In 1830 President Andrew Jackson appointed him U.S. attorney for the Ohio district. He moved to Columbus, where he practiced for the next 31 years.
