Veit Stoss, Polish Wit Stosz or Wit Stwosz  (born 1438/47, Swabia [Germany]—died  1533, Nürnberg) one of the greatest sculptors and wood-carvers of 16th-century Germany. His nervous, angular forms, realistic detail, and virtuoso wood carving synthesized the sculptural styles of Flemish and Danubian art and, together with the emotional force and dramatic realism of the Dutch sculptor Nicolaus Gerhaert von Leyden, exercised tremendous influence on the late Gothic sculpture of Germany, especially that of Nürnberg.
Stoss grew up in Nürnberg. From 1477 to 1496 he worked mainly in Poland, Bohemia, and Hungary. His principal works are the majestic high altar, carved in limewood and painted, of the Church of the Virgin Mary in Kraków (1477–89) and the sculptured tombs of King Casimir IV and Archbishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki in the cathedrals of Kraków and Gniezno, respectively.
