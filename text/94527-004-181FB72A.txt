Thingvellir, historical site, southwestern Iceland, on the northern shore of Lake Thingvalla. From 930 to 1798 it was the annual meeting place of the Althing (Parliament). Though little remains of any of the early buildings, the spectacular setting in which much of Icelandâ€™s early history unfolded is now a national park. The national park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004.
