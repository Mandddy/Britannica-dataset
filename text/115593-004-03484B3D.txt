Friedrich von Schlegel,  (born March 10, 1772, Hannover, Hanover—died  Jan. 12, 1829, Dresden, Saxony) German writer and critic, originator of many of the philosophical ideas that inspired the early German Romantic movement. Open to every new idea, he reveals a rich store of projects and theories in his provocative Aperçus and Fragmente (contributed to the Athenäum and other journals); his conception of a universal, historical, and comparative literary scholarship has had profound influence.
Schlegel was a nephew of the author Johann Elias Schlegel. After studying at Göttingen and Leipzig, he became closely associated with his elder brother August Wilhelm Schlegel at Jena in the quarterly Athenäum. He believed that Greek philosophy and culture were essential to complete education. Influenced also by J.G. Fichte’s transcendental philosophy, he developed his conception of the Romantic—that poetry should be at once philosophical and mythological, ironic and religious. But his imaginative work, a semi-autobiographical novel fragment Lucinde (1799; Eng. trans., 1913–15), and a tragedy Alarcos (1802) were less successful.
