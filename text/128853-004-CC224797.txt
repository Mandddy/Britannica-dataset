Scutellosaurus, genus of small ornithischian dinosaurs from the Early Jurassic Period (roughly 200 million to 176 million years ago) characterized by the presence of small scutes along the back and sides of the body. Scutellosaurus had small forelimbs and robust hind limbs indicative of a bipedal stance; however, some authorities maintain that its forearms were strong enough to support quadrupedal movement. Scutellosaurus reached lengths of 1.5 to 2 metres (about 5 to 6.5 feet). Its skull grew to about 9 cm (about 3.5 inches) in length, and it contained several broad incisors and a row of fluted leaf-shaped cheek teeth that appear to be adapted for feeding on plants.
The first remains of Scutellosaurus, which made up a nearly complete skeleton, were found in the Kayenta Formation of Arizona by Douglas Lawler in 1971. Lawler, then a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, took the remains to American paleontologist E.H. Colbert at the Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff. In 1981 Colbert described the remains (collected by a Harvard University field party in 1977), along with a second specimen, as Scutellosaurus lawleri. The remains of six additional specimens were recovered from other Kayenta localities in Arizona in 1983 by American paleontologist James M. Clark.
