Buenaventura Báez,  (born 1810, Azua de Compostela, Hispaniola [now Azua, Dominican Republic]—died  1884, Puerto Rico) politician who served five terms as president of the Dominican Republic and is noted principally for his attempts to have the United States annex his country.
Báez was a member of a wealthy and prominent family in the Dominican Republic. He was educated in Europe and began his political career in 1843 by helping lead the revolt that established the independence of the Dominican Republic from Haiti, with which it shares the island of Hispaniola. At this time, Báez believed that his nation could maintain its independence only by becoming a French protectorate, and to secure that end he was sent to Europe in 1846; the French, however, were not interested.
