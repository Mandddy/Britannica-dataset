Finke River, major but intermittent river of central Australia that rises south of Mount Ziel in the MacDonnell Ranges of south-central Northern Territory. The Finke passes through Glen Helen Gorge and Palm Valley and then meanders generally southeast over the Missionary Plain. Entering a 40-mile (65-km) gorge between the Krichauff and James ranges, the river emerges upon mudflats and sand flats to be joined by the Palmer and Hugh rivers. The Finke follows the western edge of the Simpson Desert and reaches Lake Eyre in South Australia only during times of flood via the Macumba Channel, when it may spread for hundreds of square miles beyond its poorly delineated banks. The river drains a basin of 44,000 square miles (115,000 square km). Its 400-mile (640-km) course is studded with permanent waterholes and underground sources. Visited (1860) by John McDouall Stuart, it was named by him after his patron, William Finke.
