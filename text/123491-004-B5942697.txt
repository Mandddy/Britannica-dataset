Sakuma Zōzan, also called Sakuma Shōzan, original name Sakuma Kunitada  (born March 10, 1811, Matsushiro [now in Nagano city], Japan—died Aug. 2, 1864, Kyōto) early and influential proponent of Westernization in Japan whose slogan Tōyō no dōtoku, seiyō no geijutsu (“Eastern ethics, Western techniques”) became the basis of the Japanese modernization effort in the late 19th century. Sakuma’s ideas, especially as they became known through his colourful disciple Yoshida Shōin, provided one of the main inspirations for the Meiji Restoration, the movement that in 1868 returned executive authority to the Japanese emperor and swept away the remnants of feudalism in the country.
After receiving a traditional Confucian education, Sakuma became one of the most trusted councillors of Sanada Yukitsura, a member of the council of advisers to the shogun, the hereditary military dictator of Japan. His espousal of Japan’s adoption of Western technology, however, was at odds with the shogunate’s xenophobic attitudes, and he and Sanada were forced to resign.
