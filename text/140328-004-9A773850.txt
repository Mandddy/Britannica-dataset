Balinese,  people of the island of Bali, Indonesia. Unlike most Indonesians, who practice Islam, the Balinese adhere to Hinduism, though their interpretation of it has been heavily influenced by the neighbouring Javanese culture. The Balinese language belongs to the Austronesian language family. In the early 21st century the Balinese numbered roughly three million.
In the traditional Balinese village each extended family lives in its own compound, a cluster of buildings enclosed by an earthen or stone wall. The shady courtyard is usually divided into three sections, containing, respectively, the rice granaries and cattle sheds, the sleeping quarters and kitchen, and the house temple. The living quarters have walls of clay and roofs of thatch or palm leaves. Typical villages have temples and an assembly hall, usually centrally located on a public square, that also serves as a site for festivals, markets, and other community activities.
