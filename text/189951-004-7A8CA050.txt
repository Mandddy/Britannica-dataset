University of Notre Dame, private institution of higher learning in Notre Dame (adjacent to South Bend), Indiana, U.S. It is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. Formerly a men’s university, it became coeducational in 1972. Comprising colleges of arts and letters, science, engineering, and business, schools of architecture and law, and a graduate school, Notre Dame offers bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degree programs in a range of disciplines. Research institutes and facilities include the Center for Social Concerns, the Institute for Church Life, the Jacques Maritain Center, and the John J. Reilly Center for Science, Technology and Values. The study-abroad program sends students to Australia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Total enrollment at the university exceeds 11,000.
The university was founded in 1842 by the Congregation of the Holy Cross, a French religious community led by Father Edward Sorin (president from 1842 to 1865). It included a men’s college, an elementary school, a college-preparatory school, a vocational (“manual labour”) school, and a novitiate. A sister school for women, St. Mary’s Academy (later St. Mary’s College), was opened in 1844. The university added science, law, and engineering departments, an academic press, and a library in the 1860s and ’70s. In the 1920s the secondary school was discontinued, and the university was reorganized into colleges. It was in the 1920s that Notre Dame’s reputation in intercollegiate gridiron football was first built, under the famous coach Knute Rockne. Under the presidency (1952–87) of the Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, the faculty and student body increased in number and the university’s physical facilities and academic programs were greatly expanded. In 1967 governance of the school passed from the Congregation of the Holy Cross to a lay board of trustees.
