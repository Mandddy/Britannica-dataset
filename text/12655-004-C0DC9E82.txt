Cottony-cushion scale,  (Icerya purchasi), a scale insect pest (order Homoptera), especially of California citrus trees. The adult lays bright red eggs in a distinctive large white mass that juts out from a twig. In summer the eggs hatch in a few days; in winter several months are required.
The insect, worldwide in distribution, is found on many plants, including acacia, pittosporum, and willow. It is particularly destructive to citrus trees and once threatened the southern California citrus industry. Imported Australian ladybird beetles, a natural enemy, brought the scale under control in California in a short time.
