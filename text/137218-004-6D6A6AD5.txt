Asian carp, any of several species of fish belonging to the carp family (Cyprinidae) that are native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Russia, and naturalized in some American waterways. The grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), following their accidental introduction into waterways in the United States, are collectively referred to as Asian carp.
Asian carp were taken to North America during the 1960s and â€™70s to control the growth of noxious aquatic plants, snails, and other pest organisms in ponds, fish farms, and small lakes. Floods and bait release by sport fishers allowed members of these species, which had proved invasive in other parts of the world, to colonize the Mississippi River system. Bighead and silver carp were considered the most significant threat because of their overconsumption of plankton. Scientists feared that Asian carp might enter Lake Michigan from the Illinois River, a tributary of the Mississippi River, through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and subsequently disturb the ecological dynamics of the Great Lakes. Beginning in 2002, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a series of electric fish barriers in the canal to prevent this from occurring.
