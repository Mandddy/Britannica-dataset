Flat-coated retriever, breed of sporting dog, powerful and deep-chested, strong enough to handle large birds and furred game. The breed was developed in the 1870s in England by S.E. Shirley, a founder of the Kennel Club. It was one of the most popular gun dogs by the turn of the century, but it became increasingly scarce after other retriever breeds came to prominence and by the 21st century was uncommon. The flat-coated retriever stands 22 to 24.5 inches (56 to 62 cm) and weighs 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg). Its thick, flat, shiny coat is solid black or liver coloured, with ample feathering and somewhat of a mane, especially in males, extending over the shoulders and withers. Although a hardworking hunter, the flat-coated retriever is an excellent family companion, with a good-natured, playful, active, and affectionate disposition. The breed was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1915.
