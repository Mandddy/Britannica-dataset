Susan Boyle,  (born April 1, 1961, Bangour Village Hospital, West Lothian, Scotland) Scottish singer whose appearance on the British television talent show Britainâ€™s Got Talent in 2009 transformed her into an international phenomenon.
Boyle grew up in Blackburn, a small Scottish industrial town, as the youngest of nine children. Because of complications during her birth, she was briefly deprived of oxygen, which left her with mild brain damage; in school she was diagnosed with learning disabilities, for which she was frequently teased and bullied. Boyle was drawn to music and singing as a young child, and at age 12 she began participating in musical productions at school. Her talent was quickly recognized by her teachers, who encouraged her to persist. After graduating from high school, Boyle worked briefly as a cook trainee at West Lothian College before beginning studies at the Edinburgh Acting School. She continued to cultivate her voice, singing in her church choir, at local karaoke bars, and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.
