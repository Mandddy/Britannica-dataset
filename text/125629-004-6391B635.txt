Black snake, any of about a dozen species of snakes that are all black or nearly so. Australia has two species of black snakes, Pseudechis porphyriacus and P. guttatus. P. porphyriacus is a small-headed member of the cobra family, Elapidae. It is blue-black with a red belly, and its average length is about 1.5 metres (5 feet). If annoyed, it expands its neck, cobra fashion. Its venom—more hemorrhagic than neurotoxic—is considered dangerous and potentially fatal.
Black snakes occur on all continents. In North America, Coluber constrictor constrictor, the black racer or black pilot snake, and Elaphe obsoleta, the black rat snake, have black-coloured forms that are mainly located in eastern North America. Outside of this region, populations of these species are coloured differently. See also racer; rat snake.
