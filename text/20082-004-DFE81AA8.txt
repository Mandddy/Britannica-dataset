Pastry, stiff dough made from flour, salt, a relatively high proportion of fat, and a small proportion of liquid. It may also contain sugar or flavourings. Most pastry is leavened only by the action of steam, but Danish pastry is raised with yeast. Pastry is rolled or patted out into thin sheets to line pie or tart pans and to enclose fillings. Poultry, tenderloin of beef and other cuts of meat, and pâtés are sometimes prepared en croûte, wrapped in a pastry crust. Thicker sheets may be formed into cases, pinwheels, crescents, or braids, with or without fillings and glazes or icings.
Variations in technique and ingredients yield pastries of varying texture. For a flaky pastry, low-gluten flour is quickly blended with butter, lard, or vegetable shortening so that the fat is broken into bits. A minimum of liquid is used, and the pastry is handled as little as possible. The extreme of flaky pastry is pâte feuilletée, which is formed by folding and refolding a butter-filled pastry to form hundreds of layers of flour and butter that rise in the oven to 12 times the height of the uncooked pastry. A yeast dough is layered with butter in a similar manner to produce wienbrod, or Danish pastry. A short pastry is one in which the ingredients are well amalgamated so that the baked pastry is tender and fine-textured, tending to crumble rather than flake. In pastries requiring tensile strength, high-gluten flour is preferred, with eggs and a higher proportion of liquid adding to the malleability of the dough. Phyllo and strudel pastries are of this type, rolled or stretched out to paper thinness.
