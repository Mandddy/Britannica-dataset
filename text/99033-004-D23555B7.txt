Streamlining, in aerodynamics, the contouring of an object, such as an aircraft body, to reduce its drag, or resistance to motion through a stream of air.
A moving body causes the air to flow around it in definite patterns, the components of which are called streamlines. Smooth, regular airflow patterns around an object are called laminar flow; they denote a minimum of disturbance of the air by the object’s motion through it. Turbulent flow occurs when air is disturbed and separates from the surface of the moving body, with the consequent formation of a zone of swirling eddies in the body’s wake. This eddy formation represents a reduction in the downstream pressure on the moving object and is a principal source of drag. Streamlining, then, is the contouring of an aircraft or other body in such a way that its turbulent wake is reduced to a minimum. The mechanics of airflow patterns lead to two principles for subsonic streamlining: (1) the forward part of the object should be well rounded, and (2) the body should gradually curve back from the midsection to a tapering rear section. An efficiently streamlined body thus takes on the look of a horizontally inclined teardrop shape.
