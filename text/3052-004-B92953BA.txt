Alaskan mountains, three principal mountain groups of far northwestern North America—the Brooks Range, Alaska Range, and Aleutian Range—found in the U.S. state of Alaska.
The mountain ranges of Alaska give their state a rugged and beautiful terrain across its entire expanse. They include the highest peak in North America and are characterized by glaciers, earthquakes, and continuing volcanic activity. Structurally, the ranges are northwestward continuations of the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific mountain system of North America. Still little explored for vast stretches, Alaska’s mountains contain, or lie close to, largely untapped mineral resources.
