Theatre of Marcellus, in Rome, building begun by Julius Caesar and completed by Augustus in 13 bc. It was dedicated in the name of Augustus’s nephew, Marcus Claudius Marcellus (42–23 bc). According to Livy, it was built on the site of an earlier theatre erected by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus—to the west of the Capitoline Hill. The theatre was restored by Vespasian. Complete foundations of the theatre’s cunei (wedge-shaped sections of seats) exist under the Savelli Palace, and part of the external arcade, in Doric and Ionic orders, is well preserved. Estimates of the theatre’s seating capacity range from 11,000 to 40,000.
