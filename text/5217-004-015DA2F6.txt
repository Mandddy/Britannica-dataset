Woodrat (genus Neotoma), any of 20 species of medium-sized North and Central American rodents. Some species are commonly known as “packrats” for their characteristic accumulation of food and debris on or near their dens. These collections, called “middens,” may include bones, sticks, dry manure, shiny metal objects, and innumerable items discarded by or stolen from humans.
The bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea), often called a packrat, is among the largest and most common woodrats, weighing up to 600 grams (about 1.3 pounds) and having a body length of up to 25 cm (nearly 10 inches). Its slightly shorter tail is longhaired and bushy, which is unique within the genus. The Arizona woodrat (N. devia) is one of the smallest, weighing less than 132 grams and having a body length of up to 15 cm. Its tail, measuring up to 14 cm long, is more typical in being densely haired but not bushy. Woodrats’ eyes are large, their protruding ears are nearly bald, and their feet are white. The long, thick, soft fur varies among species from gray to reddish brown above and from white to rust-coloured on the underparts. Some populations of the desert woodrat (N. lepida) and the white-throated woodrat (N. albigula) are black (melanistic).
