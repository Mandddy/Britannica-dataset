Buckinghamshire, administrative, geographic, and historic county of southern England. It stretches from the River Thames in the south and the outskirts of London in the southeast across the ridge of chalk upland known as the Chiltern Hills, thence across the fertile Vale of Aylesbury and a low sandy ridge to the valley of the River Ouse (or Great Ouse) in the north.
Within that region, the administrative, geographic, and historic counties encompass slightly different areas. The administrative county comprises four districts: Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks, and Wycombe. The geographic county also includes the unitary authority of Milton Keynes. The historic county encompasses the entire geographic county as well as the unitary authority of Slough, the part of the unitary authority of Windsor and Maidenhead that is north of the Thames, and the town of Linslade, which lies in South Bedfordshire district in the administrative county of Bedfordshire. Aylesbury is the county town (seat).
