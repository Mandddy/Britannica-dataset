Sarek National Park,  Sarek also spelled Sarjek,   park in Norrbotten län (county), northwestern Sweden, encompassing most of the Sarek mountain range. It was established in 1909, with the setting aside of an area of 746 square miles (1,931 square km), and it adjoins two other national parks—Stora Sjöfallet on the north and Padjelanta on the west. The almost inaccessible region, characterized by high peaks, deep valleys, wide plateaus, and glaciers, is drained by Rapa River, which empties into Lake Laitaure. The peaks of several mountains rise above 6,500 feet (2,000 metres). The highest, Mount Sarek (6,854 feet [2,089 metres]), is the second highest in Sweden, after Mount Kebne. Sarek is rich in vegetation and is the habitat of varied wildlife, including bears, wolves, wolverines, and lynxes.
