Arthur Tappan,  (born May 22, 1786, Northampton, Massachusetts, U.S.â€”died  July 23, 1865, New Haven, Connecticut) American philanthropist who used much of his energy and his fortune in the struggle to end slavery.
After a devoutly religious upbringing, Tappan moved to Boston at age 15 to enter the dry goods business. Six years later he launched his own firm in Portland, Maine, and then in 1809 moved the business to Montreal. Tappan struggled with the business both in Canada and, after the outbreak of the War of 1812, back in the United States. But in 1826 he started a new company in New York City. This business, a silk-importing firm, was successful, and Arthur and his brother Lewis became wealthy. The Panic of 1837 forced the Tappans to close their doors, but the brothers founded another lucrative enterprise when they opened the first commercial credit-rating service in the 1840s.
