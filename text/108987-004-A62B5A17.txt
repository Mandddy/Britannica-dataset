Stéphane Dion,  (born September 28, 1955, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada) Canadian politician who was leader of the Liberal Party (2007–08).
Dion was the son of one of the cofounders of Laval University’s political science department. He grew up during a period known as “the Quiet Revolution,” when Quebec’s francophone majority was agitating for more economic opportunities and increasingly favouring political separation from Canada. Although he initially supported the sovereignty movement, his federalist father’s systematic dismantling of the separatists’ arguments eventually led him to reevaluate his position. Dion pursued a career in academia, graduating with a B.A. (1977) and an M.A. (1979) in political science from Laval and a Ph.D. (1986) in sociology from the Institute of Political Studies in Paris. From 1984 to 1996 he taught political science and public administration courses at the University of Montreal.
