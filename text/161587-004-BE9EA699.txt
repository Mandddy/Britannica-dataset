Richard Tucker, original name Reuben Ticker   (born August 28, 1913, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died January 8, 1975, Kalamazoo, Michigan) American operatic tenor and cantor who sang roles in more than 30 operas.
As a youth, Tucker first sang as a member of a synagogue choir and on radio. He studied voice with Paul Althouse and made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1945 as Enzo in Amilcare Ponchielli’s La gioconda. His European debut was in 1947 at the Verona Arena in the same role opposite Maria Callas in the title role. Although Tucker sang in opera and recitals in many European cities—London, Milan, Vienna, Barcelona, Florence—his career was centred in the United States. He was a popular performer on radio and television and made a number of highly regarded recordings. Before his sudden death on a concert tour, he had sung with most of the leading American opera companies and orchestras and was highly praised as a cantor.
