Irving Kristol, in full Irving William Kristol  (born Jan. 20, 1920, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died Sept. 18, 2009, Arlington, Va.) American essayist, editor, and publisher, best known as an intellectual founder and leader of the neoconservative movement in the United States. His articulation and defense of conservative ideals against the dominant liberalism of the 1960s influenced generations of intellectuals and policymakers and contributed to the resurgence of the Republican Party in the late 1960s and its electoral successes in the 1980s.
Kristol was the son of Jewish immigrants from Europe. He grew up in Brooklyn and attended Boys’ High School and the City College of New York (CCNY), where he graduated in 1940 with a B.A. degree in history. At CCNY he was an anti-Stalinist leftist and a member of the Trotskyist Young People’s Socialist League. At a Trotskyist gathering in the early 1940s he met Gertrude Himmelfarb, who would become a leading historian of the Victorian era, and the two were married in 1942. After serving in the U.S. Army (1944–46), he followed his wife to Cambridge, Eng., where she continued her graduate studies at the University of Cambridge and he began writing for Commentary, then a liberal anticommunist journal of opinion.
