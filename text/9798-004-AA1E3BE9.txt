Nutria (Myocastor coypus), also called coypu,  a large amphibious South American rodent with webbed hind feet. The nutria has a robust body, short limbs, small eyes and ears, long whiskers, and a cylindrical, scaly tail. It can weigh up to 17 kg (37.5 pounds), although 5 to 10 kg is usual; the body measures up to 70 cm (27.6 inches) long and the tail up to 45 cm. The yellowish or reddish brown coat contains coarse guard hairs overlying soft, dense underfur.
The nutria is agile on land but is also a superb swimmer that can remain submerged for up to five minutes. It can close its mouth behind the incisor teeth, which allows it to cut submerged vegetation without swallowing water. A wide variety of aquatic vegetation is consumed, including grains, roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, cattails, water lilies, duckweed, and white clover. Mussels and snails, however, are also part of the diet. Nutrias excavate short or elaborate burrows in riverbanks and lake margins. They also build platform nests in marshes and use floating platforms as feeding sites. Breeding throughout the year, nutrias produce up to three litters of two to eight young annually; gestation takes about 135 days. Activity of these gregarious rodents depends upon season and location; they are nocturnal in most regions but in winter are active during the day.
