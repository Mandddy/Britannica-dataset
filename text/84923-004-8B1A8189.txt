Seoul 1988 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Seoul that took place Sept. 17â€“Oct. 2, 1988. The Seoul Games were the 21st occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
After boycotts had marred the previous two Olympiads, political problems threatened to return to centre stage at the 1988 Games. Violent student riots took place in Seoul in the months leading up to the Games. North Korea, still technically at war with South Korea, complained bitterly that it should have cohost status. The International Olympic Committee made some concessions to North Korea, but North Korea did not find them satisfactory and boycotted; several other countries, notably Cuba and Ethiopia, stayed away from Seoul in solidarity with North Korea. The boycott did not have the effect of previous ones, and the Seoul Games proved to be extremely competitive.
