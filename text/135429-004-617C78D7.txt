L.L. Zamenhof, in full Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, pseudonym Doktoro Esperanto (Esperanto: “Doctor Hopeful”)  (born December 15, 1859, Białystok, Poland, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died April 14, 1917, Warsaw) Polish physician and oculist who created the most important of the international artificial languages—Esperanto.
A Jew whose family spoke Russian and lived in an environment of racial and national conflict on the Polish-Russian borderland, Zamenhof dedicated himself to promoting tolerance, mainly through the development of an international language. After years of experiment in devising such a tongue, working under the pseudonym of Doktoro Esperanto, he published an expository textbook, Lingvo Internacia (1887; Dr. Esperanto’s International Language). His pseudonym, Esperanto (“[one] who hopes”), was to become the language’s name.
