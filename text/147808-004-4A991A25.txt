Geoffrey Rush, in full Geoffrey Roy Rush  (born July 6, 1951, Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia) Australian film and theatre actor who deployed his craggy features and sly wit to memorable effect, particularly as villainous or unbalanced characters.
Rush was raised in a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In 1968 he joined a theatre troupe attached to the University of Queensland in Brisbane and enrolled at the university the next year. He was recruited by the Queensland Theatre Company (QTC) in 1971 and debuted in their production of Wrong Side of the Moon. He graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in English in 1972, and, after a stint with QTC, enrolled in a directing course in London and a mime school in Paris. Upon returning to Australia in 1977, Rush resumed his relationship with QTC.
