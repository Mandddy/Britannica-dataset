Hester Lynch Piozzi, née Salusbury, also called (1763–84) Harriet Lynch Thrale, byname Mrs. Thrale  (born Jan. 27, 1740, Bodvel, Carnarvonshire, Wales—died May 2, 1821, Clifton, Bristol, Eng.) English writer and friend of Samuel Johnson.
In 1763 she married a wealthy brewer named Henry Thrale. In January 1765 Samuel Johnson was brought to dinner, and the next year, following a severe illness, Johnson spent most of the summer in the country with the Thrales. Gradually, he became part of the family circle, living about half the time in their homes. A succession of distinguished visitors came there to see Johnson and socialize with the Thrales.
