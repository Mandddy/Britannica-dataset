Louis Untermeyer,  (born Oct. 1, 1885, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Dec. 18, 1977, Newtown, Conn.) American poet, essayist, and editor who is best known for his numerous poetry anthologies.
Untermeyer early developed an interest in literature but dropped out of high school to join his father’s jewelry business in 1902. He continued to write, however, publishing collections of essays, parodies, and poetry. In 1923 he left the jewelry business to devote himself fully to a literary career. A popular speaker and lecturer, Untermeyer taught at several universities and in 1961 was named poetry consultant to the Library of Congress. He held the position, which later became that of poet laureate of the United States, until 1963.
