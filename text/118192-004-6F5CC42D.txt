Oregon grape, also called holly grape,  any of several species of the genus Mahonia, evergreen shrubs of the barberry family (Berberidaceae) grown for their ornamental value. M. aquifolium, the typical Oregon grape, is 90 cm (3 feet) or more tall and is native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is most used for its foliage: the glossy, leathery leaves, with five to nine leaflets, are spiny-edged like a holly. Small fragrant yellow flowers in terminal clusters precede small blue edible berries that can be made into jelly.
Among the lower-growing Oregon grapes are M. repens, also called creeping barberry, M. nervosa, also called water holly, and M. pumila; protected from winter winds, these varieties provide durable ground cover.
