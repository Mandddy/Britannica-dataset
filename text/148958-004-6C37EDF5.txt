River Swale, river that rises on the slopes of High Seat and Nine Standards Rigg near Keld, North Yorkshire, Eng., and then flows southeast across North Yorkshire for 60 miles (100 km) to become a major tributary of the River Ouse to the north of the city of York. The Swale takes its name from an Old English word meaning “tumultuous river.” Its upper reaches flow through the Pennine uplands in a deep troughlike valley known as Swaledale. The heavily wooded dale is renowned for its scenic beauty and attracts many summer visitors. During the 19th century a considerable amount of lead mining was undertaken in the area. The major town on the river is Richmond, with a castle dating from the 11th century. The river also flows past the towns Muker and Catterick.
