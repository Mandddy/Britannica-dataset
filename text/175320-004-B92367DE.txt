Fantasia, American animated film, released in 1940, that was produced by Walt Disney and features seven unrelated segments set to classical music under the direction of famed conductor Leopold Stokowski. Viewers and critics have deemed the film, which lacks an overarching narrative, both bewildering and impressive.
Several of the sequences are widely considered to be too slow in pace, while others, such as the dramatic rendering of a witches’ sabbath set to Modest Mussorgsky’s “Night on Bald Mountain,” are praised for their mesmerizing intensity. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker Suite” is danced by fantastical corps of fish, fairies, and flora, while another segment, set to Amilcare Ponchielli’s “Dance of the Hours,” features a cast of animals, including hippos and elephants. The film’s most famous segment, “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” places Mickey Mouse in the title role and is scored with a piece by French composer Paul Dukas. Its famous central image, of an implacable army of enchanted brooms, is one of the most indelible in animated film.
