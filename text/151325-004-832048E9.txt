Antioch, also called Antioch Pisidian, Greek Antiocheia Pisidias,  ancient city in Phrygia, near the Pisidian border, close to modern Yalvaç, in west-central Turkey. Founded by Seleucus I Nicator (c. 358–281 bc), it was made a free city in 189 bc by the Romans, who took direct control about 25 bc; soon thereafter the emperor Augustus made it a colony with the name Caesarea Antiochia. It became the centre of civil and military administration in southern Galatia, and in the time of the emperor Claudius I (reigned ad 41–54), St. Paul made it one of the centres of his mission in that province. Antioch was finally assigned to Pisidia under the emperor Diocletian’s provincial reorganization. Its ruins include a large rock cutting which may have held the temple of Men Ascaënus, the local Phrygian deity.
