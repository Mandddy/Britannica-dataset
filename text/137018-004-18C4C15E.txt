Peace People, also called Community of Peace People,  peace organization with headquarters in Belfast, N.Ire. Founded by Máiread Maguire, Betty Williams, and Ciaran McKeown, it began in 1976 as a grassroots movement to protest the ongoing violence in Northern Ireland. Hundreds of thousands of people, not only in Northern Ireland but also in the republic of Ireland and farther abroad, subsequently participated in protest marches and other manifestations of support for the movement, and Williams and Maguire received the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts. The Peace People later developed into an internationally influential nongovernmental organization dedicated to building a peaceful world in which the highest standards of human and civil rights are upheld.
The Peace People movement was a response to Northern Ireland’s “Troubles”—a period of violent conflict between Protestants and Roman Catholics, a religious division that often paralleled the political divide between those who supported rule by the predominantly Protestant United Kingdom (loyalists) and those who favoured a union with the predominantly Catholic republic of Ireland (republicans). By the early 1970s the unrest had led to an increased presence of British troops in Northern Ireland, which in turn incited a campaign of bombings and shootings by the anti-British Irish Republican Army (IRA).
