Magnesium processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products.
Magnesium (Mg) is a silvery white metal that is similar in appearance to aluminum but weighs one-third less. With a density of only 1.738 grams per cubic centimetre, it is the lightest structural metal known. It has a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystalline structure, so that, like most metals of this structure, it lacks ductility when worked at lower temperatures. In addition, in its pure form, it lacks sufficient strength for most structural applications. However, the addition of alloying elements improves these properties to such an extent that both cast and wrought magnesium alloys are widely used, particularly where light weight and high strength are important.
