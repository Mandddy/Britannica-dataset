Medium Cool, American film drama, released in 1969, that captured the fractious spirit of its day and highlighted the many social and ethical issues of the late 1960s.
Medium Cool follows television news cameraman John Cassellis (played by Robert Forster) as he shoots hard-to-get footage of disasters, accidents, and other unseemly incidents that his network demands. Cassellis faces a moral dilemma when he learns his bosses are providing footage to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track down dissidents. Initially detached from the material he films, he experiences an emotional awakening by the movieâ€™s conclusion.
