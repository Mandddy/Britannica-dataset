Hubris, Greek hybris,  in ancient Athens, the intentional use of violence to humiliate or degrade. The word’s connotation changed over time, and hubris came to be defined as overweening presumption that leads a person to disregard the divinely fixed limits on human action in an ordered cosmos.
The most-famous example of hubris in ancient Greece was the case of Meidias, who in 348 bce struck the orator Demosthenes in the face when the latter was dressed in ceremonial robes and performing an official function. This sense of hubris could also characterize rape. Hubris was a crime at least from the time of Solon (6th century bce), and any citizen could bring charges against another party, as was the case also for treason or impiety. (In contrast, only a member of the victim’s family could bring charges for murder.)
