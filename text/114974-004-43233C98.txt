Bookbinding, the joining together of a number of leaves or folios (most frequently of paper, parchment, or vellum) within covers to form a codex or book, as opposed to a roll or scroll.
Bookbinding began when the codex started to replace the roll. The earliest elaborately decorated bookbindings were those produced for use on church altars. Those that survive are often magnificent examples of the jeweller’s, goldsmith’s, ivory carver’s, or embroiderer’s arts. But the typical artistic bookbinding is of decorated leather, an art first practiced in the monasteries of the Coptic Church in Egypt.
