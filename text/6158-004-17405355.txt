Milton Babbitt, in full Milton Byron Babbitt   (born May 10, 1916, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 29, 2011, Princeton, New Jersey) American composer and theorist known as a leading proponent of total serialism—i.e., musical composition based on prior arrangements not only of all 12 pitches of the chromatic scale (as in 12-tone music) but also of dynamics, duration, timbre (tone colour), and register.
Babbitt attended public schools in Jackson, Mississippi; he played violin as a young child and then turned to piano, clarinet, and saxophone. In his youth he loved jazz and other popular music. After beginning mathematics studies at the University of Pennsylvania, he transferred to New York University as a music major. In New York City he also studied privately for several years with the composer Roger Sessions.
