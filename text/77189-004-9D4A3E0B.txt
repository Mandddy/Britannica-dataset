Jason Robards, in full Jason Nelson Robards, Jr.  (born July 26, 1922, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died December 26, 2000, Bridgeport, Connecticut) intense, introspective stage and film actor, widely regarded as the foremost interpreter of playwright Eugene O’Neill.
Because of the bitterness and disillusionment expressed by his father, onetime stage and film leading man Jason Robards, Sr. (1892–1963), the younger Robards avoided acting in his youth. He served in the Naval Reserve as a radioman during the years 1940–46; he was present at the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and he later received the Navy Cross. Upon his discharge, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he studied with Uta Hagen. Billed as Jason Robards, Jr., he made his first professional New York stage appearance in 1947, in a children’s theatre production of Jack and the Beanstalk. Supplementing his acting income by working as a cab driver and a schoolteacher, he spent several years playing small roles onstage and in radio and television before he won a lead role in the 1953 Broadway production American Gothic.
