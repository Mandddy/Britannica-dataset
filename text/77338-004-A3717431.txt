Jacques Tati, byname of Jacques Tatischeff   (born October 9, 1908, Le Pecq, Franceâ€”died November 5, 1982, Paris) French filmmaker and actor who gained renown for his comic films that portrayed people in conflict with the mechanized modern world. He wrote and starred in all six of the feature films that he directed; in four of them he played the role of Monsieur Hulot, a lanky, pipe-smoking fellow with a quizzical, innocent nature.
After a stint as a professional rugby player, Tati began a career as a music-hall entertainer in the 1930s, doing pantomimes of athletes and occasionally performing in movies. During World War II he served with the French army.
