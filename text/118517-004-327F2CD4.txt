Raytheon Company, major American industrial corporation with core manufacturing concentrations in defense and aerospace electronics. Established in 1922, the company reincorporated in 1928 and adopted its present name in 1959. Its electronics and defense-systems units produce air-, sea-, and land-launched missiles, radar and sonar systems, weapons sensors and targeting systems, communication and battle-management systems, and satellite components. Raytheon is also a leader in marine electronics, manufacturing shipboard radar and sonar systems, autopilots, and Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. In 2011 it employed about 70,000 people worldwide and had markets in more than 80 countries. Headquarters are in Waltham, Massachusetts.
Raytheon was founded in 1922 as the American Appliance Company by three scientist-engineers—Laurence K. Marshall, Charles G. Smith, and Vannevar Bush—in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its focus, which was originally on new refrigeration technology, soon shifted to electronics. The company developed a “gaseous rectifier,” an electron tube able to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive short-lived batteries. In 1925 the company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began marketing its rectifier, under the Raytheon brand name, with great commercial success. In 1928 Raytheon merged with Q.R.S. Company, an American manufacturer of electron tubes and switches, to form the successor Raytheon Manufacturing Company. In 1933 it diversified by acquiring Acme-Delta Company, a producer of transformers, power equipment, and electronic auto parts.
