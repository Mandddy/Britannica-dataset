Nut,  in botany, dry, hard fruit that does not split open at maturity to release its single seed. A nut resembles an achene but develops from more than one carpel (female reproductive structure), often is larger, and has a tough, woody wall. Examples are the chestnut, hazelnut, and acorn. Although popularly called “nuts,” the peanut is a legume, the coconut a drupe, and the Brazil nut a seed. Apart from their importance as food for man and animals, many nuts are processed to obtain a very fine charcoal used for absorption of gases, as in gas masks and industrial filters.
