Robert Moses,  (born Dec. 18, 1888, New Haven, Conn., U.S.—died July 29, 1981, West Islip, N.Y.) U.S. state and municipal official whose career in public works planning resulted in a virtual transformation of the New York landscape. Among the works completed under his supervision were a network of 35 highways, 12 bridges, numerous parks, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Shea Stadium, many housing projects, two hydroelectric dams, and the 1964 New York World’s Fair. His projects greatly influenced large-scale planning in other cities in the United States. He was also instrumental in bringing the UN complex to Manhattan’s East River waterfront.
Moses studied political science at Yale, Oxford, and Columbia universities. He began a long career of public service for the state and especially for the city of New York in 1913, when he joined the city’s bureau of municipal research. His work there led to his appointment in 1919 by Gov. Alfred E. Smith as chief of staff of the New York state reconstruction commission, which sought administrative reforms in the state government.
