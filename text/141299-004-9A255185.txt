Snakehead, any of a number of species of freshwater fish of the family Channidae, found in Africa and Asia. Snakeheads, long-bodied and more or less cylindrical in cross section, have large mouths and long, single dorsal and anal fins; they range from about 10 to 90 cm (4 to 36 inches) long. Snakeheads are able to breathe atmospheric air with the aid of a pair of vascular cavities located near the gills. Carnivorous in habit, they can survive for extended periods out of water. In some areas, they are used as food.
