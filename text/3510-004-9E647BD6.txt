George Edward Pickett,  (born Jan. 16?, 1825, Richmond, Va., U.S.—died July 30, 1875, Norfolk, Va.) Confederate army officer during the American Civil War, known for Pickett’s Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg.
Sources differ on Pickett’s birth date, though a baptismal record indicates that he was born on Jan. 16, 1825. After graduating last in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. (1846), Pickett served with distinction in the Mexican-American War (1846–47). He resigned his commission in June 1861 and entered the Confederate army, in which he was made brigadier general in February 1862. Pickett rose to major general in October and was given command of a Virginia division. At the Battle of Fredericksburg he commanded the centre of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s line but saw little action.
