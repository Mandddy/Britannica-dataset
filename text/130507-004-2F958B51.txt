Yazīdī, also spelled Yezīdī, Azīdī, Zedī, or Izdī,  member of a Kurdish religious minority found primarily in northern Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northern Syria, the Caucasus region, and parts of Iran. The Yazīdī religion includes elements of ancient Iranian religions as well as elements of Judaism, Nestorian Christianity, and Islam. Although scattered and probably numbering only between 200,000 and 1,000,000, the Yazīdīs have a well-organized society, with a chief sheikh as the supreme religious head and an emir, or prince, as the secular head.
The origins of the name Yazīdī are uncertain; some scholars have proposed that it comes from the Old Iranian yazata (divine being), while others hold that it derives from the name of the Umayyad caliph Yazīd I, who is venerated by Yazīdīs.
