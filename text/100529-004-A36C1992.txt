Propeller, device with a central hub and radiating blades placed so that each forms part of a helical (spiral) surface. By its rotation in water or air, a propeller produces thrust owing to aerodynamic or fluid forces acting upon the blades and gives forward motion to a ship or aircraft. In Great Britain the propeller of an airplane or the rotor of a helicopter is commonly called an airscrew.
A propellerâ€™s thrust is proportional to the product of the mass of water or air that it is acting on and the accelerating rate. For the most efficient propulsion, the mass should be large and the acceleration small.
