John Augustus Roebling,  (born June 12, 1806, Mühlhausen, Prussia [now in Germany]—died July 22, 1869, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) German-born U.S. civil engineer, a pioneer in the design of suspension bridges whose best-known work is the Brooklyn Bridge, New York City, completed under the direction of his eldest son, Washington Augustus, in 1883.
After taking classes at the building academy in Berlin for two semesters, Roebling worked for the Prussian government for three years and at the age of 25 emigrated to the U.S. He settled with his older brother Carl and others from his hometown of Mühlhausen in a small colony that was later called Saxonburg, near Pittsburgh, in the hills of western Pennsylvania. He married the daughter of another Mühlhausen emigrant, and they had nine children. When Carl died unexpectedly a short while later, John Roebling abandoned the colony and went to the state capital in Harrisburg to seek employment as a surveyor.
