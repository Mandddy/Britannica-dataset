Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th duke of Devonshire,  (born July 23, 1833, Lower Holker, Lancashire, Eng.—died March 24, 1908, Cannes, Fr.) British statesman whose opposition to the Irish Home Rule policy of his own Liberal Party caused him to assume (1886) the leadership of the Liberal Unionist Party and to become increasingly identified with the Conservatives. On three occasions (1880, 1886, and 1887) he declined the office of prime minister.
Entering the House of Commons in 1857, Lord Hartington was secretary of state for war from February to July 1866. During William Gladstone’s first prime ministership, he was postmaster general (1868–71), directing the nationalization of the British telegraph services, and afterward was chief secretary for Ireland. In January 1875, when Gladstone temporarily retired from politics, Hartington became the Liberal leader in the House of Commons. In Gladstone’s second administration (1880–85), Hartington was secretary of state for India until December 1882, and then he returned to the war office. He shared the responsibility for assigning General Charles George (“Chinese”) Gordon to evacuate British troops from the Sudan in 1884, but he repeatedly and unsuccessfully urged the Cabinet to hasten the expedition to relieve Gordon.
