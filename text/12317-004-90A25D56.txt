Franz Ferdinand, count von Dingelstedt,  (born June 30, 1814, Halsdorf, Hesse-Kassel [Germany]—died  May 15, 1881, Vienna, Austria) German poet, playwright, and theatrical producer known for his biting political satires.
A member of the liberal Young Germany movement, Dingelstedt wrote political satires against the German princes, notably Die Neuen Argonauten (1839; “The New Argonauts”) and a collection of satirical poems, Lieder eines Kosmopolitischen Nachtwächters (1841; “Songs of a Cosmopolitan Nightwatchman”). Publication of the former book led to his dismissal from his job as a teacher in 1841. Between 1841 and 1843 he was a correspondent in Paris and London and underwent a political conversion that marked the beginning of his career as a state official.
