Head flattening, practice of intentionally changing the shape of the human skull, once common in some cultures. Head flattening was practiced by a number of North, Central, and South American Indian tribes, particularly before European colonization. It was most commonly accomplished by securing an infant in a cradleboard that had a moveable cover over the forehead; the pressure of the cover, gently and consistently applied over time, caused the child’s forehead to elongate, creating a nearly smooth silhouette from the tip of the nose to the crown of the head; flattening could also be achieved by binding an infant’s head with cloth. Head flattening appears to have had no effect on an individual’s mental capabilities. See also body modifications.
