Humboldt University of Berlin, German Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, byname University of Berlin, formerly (1810–1949) Friedrich Wilhelm University,  coeducational state-supported institution of higher learning in Berlin. The university was founded in 1809–10 by the linguist, philosopher, and educational reformer Wilhelm von Humboldt, then Prussian minister of education. Under Humboldt’s guidance the university, originally named after Frederick William III of Prussia, developed into the largest in Germany. It enrolled more than 1,750 students by 1840 and became a leader in teaching and research. The University of Berlin attained world renown for its modern curriculum, its impartial and nondogmatic spirit of intellectual inquiry, and its specialized scientific research institutes, in which many basic techniques of laboratory experimentation were pioneered. The university’s foremost professors in the 19th century included the philosophers G.W.F. Hegel, J.G. Fichte, and Arthur Schopenhauer; the historians Leopold von Ranke, Theodor Mommsen, and B.G. Niebuhr; the scientists Hermann von Helmholtz and Rudolf Virchow; the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher; and the folklorists Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.
In the 1930s the university underwent a decline when its faculty and curriculum were Nazified and many of its academic figures fled abroad. Under control of the German Democratic Republic after World War II, it was renamed Humboldt-Universität after its founder and given a Marxist-Leninist orientation in much of its curriculum.
