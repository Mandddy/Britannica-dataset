John Skelton,  (born c. 1460—died  June 21, 1529, London) Tudor poet and satirist of both political and religious subjects whose reputation as an English poet of major importance was restored only in the 20th century and whose individual poetic style of short rhyming lines, based on natural speech rhythms, has been given the name of Skeltonics.
His place of birth and childhood is unknown. He was educated at the University of Cambridge and later achieved the status of “poet laureate” (a degree in rhetoric) at Oxford, Leuven (Louvain) in the Netherlands (now in Belgium), and Cambridge. This success and also his skill at translating ancient Greek and Roman authors led to his appointment in 1488 first as court poet to Henry VII and later, in addition, as “scolemaster” to the Duke of York (later Henry VIII). In 1498 Skelton took holy orders and in 1502, when Henry became heir to the throne and the royal household was reorganized, he became rector of Diss, in Norfolk, a position he held until his death, though from 1512 he lived in London. In about 1512 Henry VIII granted him the title of orator regius, and in this capacity Skelton became a forthright adviser to the King, in court poems, on public issues, and on church affairs.
