Alan Jackson,  (born October 17, 1958, Newnan, Georgia, U.S.) American country music singer-songwriter, who was one of the most popular male country artists of the 1990s and early 21st century.
Jackson grew up in rural Georgia singing gospel music and performing, as a teenager, in a country duo. After dropping out of school and wedding his high-school sweetheart, Denise, Jackson worked odd jobs while playing with his band, Dixie Steel. After Denise, a flight attendant, happened upon country artist Glen Campbell in an airport in 1985, Jackson’s demo tape landed him a songwriting contract with Campbell’s music-publishing company. The couple subsequently moved to Nashville.
