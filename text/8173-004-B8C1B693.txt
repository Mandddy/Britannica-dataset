Pomeranian, breed of toy dog that can be traced back, like the related Keeshond, Samoyed, and Norwegian elkhound, to early sled-dog ancestors. The breed is named for the duchy of Pomerania, where, in the early 19th century, it is said to have been bred down in size from a 30-pound (13.5-kg) sheepdog. Characteristically spirited but docile, the Pomeranian is a compactly built dog with a foxlike head and small, erect ears. Its long coat, especially full on the neck and chest, may be any of a variety of colours, including white, black, brown, and reddish brown. The Pomeranian stands about 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm) high and weighs about 3 to 7 pounds (1.5 to 3 kg).
