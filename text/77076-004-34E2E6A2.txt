William Wellman, in full William Augustus Wellman  (born February 29, 1896, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.—died December 9, 1975, Los Angeles, California) American film director whose more than 80 movies include Hollywood classics of documentary-like realism and who has been ranked as an action director alongside Howard Hawks and John Ford.
Wellman’s stockbroker father came from a family of means; his mother, an Irish immigrant, was a well-respected probation officer who testified before Congress about juvenile delinquency and whose charges included her son when Wellman was kicked out of high school in Newton, Massachusetts. After trying his hand at a number of jobs, Wellman became a professional ice hockey player in Boston, where actor Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., saw him play, took a liking to him, and offered to find him a job in Hollywood. In 1917, before the United States had entered World War I, Wellman volunteered for ambulance duty in France, then joined the French Foreign Legion, and finally became a fighter pilot in the Lafayette Escadrille, a French air corps unit made up of American flyers. In the process he earned the nickname “Wild Bill,” was shot down, and won the Croix de Guerre for gallantry under fire. Before the war ended, Wellman joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and served as a flight instructor in San Diego. Following the war, Wellman took up Fairbanks’s longstanding offer and went to Hollywood but, after appearing in a small role in the silent film The Knickerbocker Buckaroo (1919), found that he did not like acting. With Fairbanks’s help, he then got a job at Goldwyn Pictures as a messenger and worked his way up through the ranks of the new industry.
