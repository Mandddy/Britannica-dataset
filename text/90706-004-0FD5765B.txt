Ozu Yasujirō,  (born Dec. 12, 1903, Tokyo, Japan—died  Dec. 12, 1963, Tokyo) motion-picture director who originated the shomin-geki (“common-people’s drama”), a genre dealing with lower-middle-class Japanese family life. Owing to the centrality of domestic relationships in his films, their detailed character portrayals, and their pictorial beauty, Ozu was considered the most typically Japanese of all directors and received more honours in his own country than did any other director.
Reared in Tokyo, Ozu became an assistant cameraman for the Shōchiku Motion Picture Company, Tokyo, in 1923. By the mid-1920s he was a director, but not until the early 1930s did he establish his reputation by such outstanding shomin-geki silent comedies as Daigaku wa deta keredo (1929; I Graduated, But . . . ) and Umarete wa mita keredo (1932; I Was Born, But . . . ). Ten years later Toda-ke no kyodai (1941; The Toda Brother and His Sisters), a consideration of Japanese attitudes toward motherhood, was his first box-office success.
