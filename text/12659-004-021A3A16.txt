Cotta Family,  family of German publishers, the most notable of whom, Johann Friedrich Cotta, Baron von Cottendorf, is celebrated for his connection with J.W. von Goethe and other writers of the period.
Johann Georg Cotta (1631–92), the founder of the publishing house, settled in Württemberg and in 1659 acquired by marriage the bookseller’s business of Philipp Brunn at Tübingen, thereby establishing the J.G. Cotta’sche Buchhandlung. On his death the firm passed to his son Johann Georg (2) and after him to his eldest son Johann Georg (3). Christoph Friedrich Cotta (1730–1807), son of Johann Georg (3), established a printing house to the court at Stuttgart. It was his son, Johann Friedrich, who restored the fortunes of the family firm, then in decline, and who became the best known of the Cottas.
