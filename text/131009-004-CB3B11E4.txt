Thunderbirds, official name U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron,  U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft squadron that performs aerobatics at air shows and other events throughout the United States and around the world. The squadron includes six pilots, who fly with the team for two years (half the pilots are replaced each year), and some 135 support personnel. The squadron, which practices and performs 50 weeks a year, is stationed at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas.
The team officially began in May 1953 as the 3600th Air Demonstration Unit at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. Following the Korean War, its mission was to show the American public the safety, reliability, and maneuverability of jet-engine aircraft, which were relatively new at the time. The Thunderbirds have performed in all 50 states and dozens of countries in thousands of formation-flying demonstrations, which serve as a recruiting tool for the U.S. Air Force and create goodwill for the American government.
