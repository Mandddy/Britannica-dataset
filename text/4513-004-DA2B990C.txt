Sun bittern,  (species Eurypyga helias), slender bird of tropical America, the sole member of the family Eurypygidae (order Gruiformes). It has strikingly patterned wings, which the male spreads in courtship and threat displays. The sun bittern is about 43 cm (17 inches) long, with full wings and a long tail beautifully marked in browns, yellows, black, and white. It lives on the ground along forest streams and feeds on insects and crustaceans caught using its bill. It builds a bulky nest in trees and lays two or three rusty to brownish eggs that are incubated by both sexes.
