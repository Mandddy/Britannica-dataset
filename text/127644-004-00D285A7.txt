Tripura, state of India. It is located in the northeastern part of the subcontinent. It is bordered to the north, west, and south by Bangladesh, to the east by the state of Mizoram, and to the northeast by the state of Assam. It is among the smallest of India’s states and is located in an isolated hilly region of the country, with various indigenous peoples—or tribes—accounting for a significant portion of the population. The capital is Agartala, near the Bangladesh border in the northwestern part of the state. Area 4,049 square miles (10,486 square km). Pop. (2011) 3,671,032.
Central and northern Tripura is a hilly region crossed by four major valleys—from east to west, the Dharmanagar, the Kailashahar, the Kamalpur, and the Khowai, all carved by northward-flowing rivers (the Juri, Manu and Deo, Dhalai, and Khowai, respectively). North-south-trending ranges separate the valleys. East of the Dharmanagar valley, the Jampai Tlang range rises to elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 feet (600 and 900 metres). Elevation decreases westward through the successive ranges—the Sakhan Tlang, the Langtarai Range, and the Athara Mura Range—with the westernmost hills, the Deotamura, attaining heights of only 800 feet (240 metres).
