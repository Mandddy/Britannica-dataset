Updraft and downdraft, in meteorology, upward-moving and downward-moving air currents, respectively, that are due to several causes. Local daytime heating of the ground causes surface air to become much warmer than the air above, and, because warmer air is less dense, it rises and is replaced by descending cooler air. The vertical ascending current, called a thermal, may reach an altitude of 3 km (2 miles) or more. The greater the radius of the thermal, the higher it is likely to ascend. Updrafts and downdrafts also occur as part of the turbulence that is created when air passes over topographic barriers such as mountains.
Strong updrafts and downdrafts occur in thunderstorms as well. Updrafts characterize a stormâ€™s early development, during which warm air rises to the level where condensation begins and precipitation starts to develop. In a mature storm, updrafts are present alongside downdrafts caused by cooling and by falling precipitation. These downdrafts, originating at high levels, contain cold, dense air that spreads out at the ground as a cold air wedge. The sharp changes in wind direction associated with downdrafts near the ground are a threat to aircraft during landing and takeoff. Intense downdrafts are called downbursts or microbursts.
