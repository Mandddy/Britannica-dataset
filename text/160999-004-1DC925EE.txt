Blessed Eugenius III, also known as Eugene, original name Bernard of Pisa, Italian Bernardo di Pisa, or Bernardo Paganelli di Montemagno?   (born , near Pisaâ€”died July 8, 1153, Tivoli, near Rome; beatified 1872; feast day July 8) pope from 1145 to 1153.
Possibly a member of the family Paganelli di Montemagno, he was a disciple of St. Bernard of Clairvaux and a Cistercian abbot of the monastery of SS. Vincent and Anastasius when he was elected on February 15. The election of someone outside the conclave was unusual and angered the Roman mob, which forced the new pope to flee the city. Eugenius, like others of western Europe, was shocked by the fall of Edessa, the capital of the first crusader state, in 1144. With Rome in a state of anarchy, by early 1146 Eugenius was forced into exile by his archenemy, the Italian reformer Arnold of Brescia. While in France (1147) he urged King Louis VII the Young to lead a crusade for the liberation of Edessa, naming Bernard as its preacher. The Second Crusade, most impressive of all in scope, ended in failure.
