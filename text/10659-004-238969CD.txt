Otto Jespersen, in full Jens Otto Harry Jespersen   (born July 16, 1860, Randers, Den.—died  April 30, 1943, Roskilde) Danish linguist and a foremost authority on English grammar. He helped to revolutionize language teaching in Europe, contributed greatly to the advancement of phonetics, linguistic theory, and the history of English, and originated an international language, Novial.
As a boy Jespersen was inspired by the accomplishments of the famed Danish linguist Rasmus Rask, whose grammars he used to begin a study of Icelandic, Italian, and Spanish. He decided to explore language studies at a time when phonetics and reform in language teaching were prime concerns. In 1886, the year before receiving his master’s degree in French from Copenhagen University, he published his first important paper, on phonetic laws, and helped to establish a Scandinavian association for the reform of language education. As professor of English at Copenhagen (1893–1925), he led a movement for basing foreign-language teaching on the use of conversational speech rather than on textbook study of grammar and vocabulary, and he wrote a number of textbooks used in Denmark and other countries. He presented theoretical considerations of language teaching in Sprogundervisning (1901; How to Teach a Foreign Language). Jespersen published extensively on English; one of his most vital works, Growth and Structure of the English Language (1905), was reprinted in 1969. His great work in this area was the encyclopaedic Modern English Grammar, 7 vol. (1909–49).
