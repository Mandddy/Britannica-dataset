Torne River, Swedish Torneälven, or Torneälv, Finnish Torniojoki,  northernmost river of Sweden. It rises near the Norwegian border west of Torne Lake, the largest lake in Swedish Lapland, and flows for 354 miles (570 km) to the Gulf of Bothnia, which it enters at a point between Haparanda and Tornio, Fin. The Torne River’s lower course forms the boundary between Sweden and Finland. The drainage basin is 15,537 square miles (40,240 square km) in area, about one-third of which is in Finland and Norway. The upper course of the Torne has waterfalls, while the lower course of the river is strewn with rapids and is thus mostly non-navigable; it was formerly much used for logging, however, and is known for its salmon.
