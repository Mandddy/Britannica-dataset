Moonrat (Echinosorex gymnura), a large Southeast Asian insectivore that is essentially a primitive tropical hedgehog with a long tail and fur instead of spines. Despite their name, moonrats are not rodents, although they have a slim body, small unpigmented ears, small eyes, and a tapered muzzle with long whiskers. Like other insectivores, they have a mobile snout.
The moonrat is found on the Malayan Peninsula (south of 12Â° N latitude), the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo, and the island of Labuan, where it inhabits lowland rainforests, mangrove forests, and sometimes rubber plantations adjacent to rainforests. It is solitary, strictly terrestrial, and active mostly during the night. With the body well clear of the ground, it wanders with a ratlike gait along the forest floor, usually along or not far from streams. It rests in hollow tree trunks rotting on the ground, under tree roots, or in ground cavities. Running takes the form of a slow, clumsy, rocking gallop, and moonrats can easily be chased down by humans. Moonrats, however, are malodorous. Their anal glands produce a powerful scent, resembling ammonia or rotten garlic, that envelops the animal and can be smelled from several yards away. Dens are marked by secretions from the scent glands. Burrows and rock crevices on the forest floor serve as dens, as do nipa palms in mangrove forests.
