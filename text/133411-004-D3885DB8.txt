Nimbarka, also called Nimbaditya or Niyamananda  (flourished 13th century, South India) Telugu-speaking Brahman, yogi, philosopher, and prominent astronomer who founded the devotional sect called Nimbarkas, Nimandi, or Nimavats, who worshipped the deity Krishna and his consort, Radha.
Nimbarka has been identified with Bhaskara, a 9th- or 10th-century philosopher and celebrated commentator on the Brahma-sutras (Vedanta-sutras). Most historians of Hindu mysticism, however, hold that Nimbarka probably lived in the 12th or 13th century.
