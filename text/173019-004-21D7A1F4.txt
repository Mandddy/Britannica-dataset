Nicolas-Charles Oudinot, duc de Reggio,  (born April 25, 1767, Bar-le-Duc, France—died September 13, 1847, Paris) general, administrator, and marshal of France in the Napoleonic Wars whose career illustrates the opportunities to rise in the French army after the Revolution.
Oudinot was the son of a businessman. In 1784 he joined France’s royal army but, since commoners were barred from promotion, resigned in 1787. After the French Revolution, however, he became the leader of Meuse volunteers (1792) and was transferred to the regular army the following year, rising to general of brigade (1794) for his heroic resistance at Kaiserslautern. Becoming general of division (1799) and chief of staff under André Masséna, Oudinot fought in Switzerland and Italy and then commanded an elite division of grenadiers (1805–07) in fighting at Austerlitz and Ostrolenka.
