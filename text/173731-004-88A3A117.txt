Magnus Brostrup Landstad,  (born October 7, 1802, Måsøy, Norway—died October 8, 1880, Kristiania [now Oslo]) pastor and poet who published the first collection of authentic Norwegian traditional ballads (1853).
After ordination, Landstad served in several parishes in the Telemark district, an area known for its rich folk tradition, before going to Christiania (later Kristiania), where he remained the rest of his life. His material for Norske folkeviser (1852–53; “Norwegian Folk Ballads”) dates back to the European Middle Ages and deals with the exploits of trolls, heroes, knights, and gods; a supplement contains folk melodies collected by L.M. Lindeman. Norwegian folk-ballad style owes its significance in equal measure to Landstad’s devotion to his Telemark background and to the emergence of literary works in the New Norwegian dialect idiom. Though a later, more authoritative collection was published, Landstad’s book continued to be the most influential; Henrik Ibsen drew many of the themes for his early dramas from the Landstad collection.
