Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton,  Daubenton also spelled D’aubenton   (born May 29, 1716, Montbard, Côte d’Or, France—died  Jan. 1, 1800, Paris) French naturalist who was a pioneer in the fields of comparative anatomy and paleontology.
Daubenton was studying medicine when, in 1742, the renowned naturalist Georges Buffon asked him to prepare anatomical descriptions for an ambitious work on natural history (Histoire naturelle, 1794–1804). Daubenton completed descriptions of 182 species of quadrupeds for the first section of the work before a dispute with Buffon ended the collaboration. Two years later, their friendship renewed, Daubenton was appointed Buffon’s assistant as keeper and demonstrator of the department of natural history at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris. He acquired the reputation of a prolific scientist, completing many zoological descriptions and dissections and undertaking productive studies in the comparative anatomy of recent and fossil animals, plant physiology, and mineralogy. He conducted agricultural experiments and introduced Merino sheep to France. In 1775 he became lecturer of natural history at the college of medicine, then professor of zoology at the Collège de France (1778). When the Jardin des Plantes in Paris was converted to the Museum of Natural History in 1793, he became its first director.
