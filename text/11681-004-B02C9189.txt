Frogfish, any of about 60 species of small marine fishes of the family Antennariidae (order Lophiiformes), usually found in shallow, tropical waters. Frogfishes are robust, rather lumpy fishes with large mouths and, often, prickly skins. The largest species grow about 30 cm (12 inches) long.
Frogfishes, members of the group known as anglerfishes, are usually provided with a “fishing pole,” tipped with a fleshy “bait,” located on the snout and derived from the first dorsal fin spine. This lure is used to entice prey fish. Frogfishes vary in colour; often patterned to blend with their surroundings, some are able to change colour. They generally lie quietly on the bottom or crawl slowly about with their limblike pectoral fins. The sargassum fish (Histrio histrio) is patterned very much like the sargassum weed in which it lives.
