Agnes Nestor,  (born June 24, 1880, Grand Rapids, Mich., U.S.—died Dec. 28, 1948, Chicago, Ill.)  American labour leader and reformer, remembered as a powerful force in unionizing women workers in several clothing and related industries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Nestor attended Michigan public and parochial schools. In 1897 she moved with her family to Chicago, where she went to work in a glove factory. In the spring of 1898 the women glove makers in her factory, encouraged by their unionized male colleagues, went on strike. Articulate and stalwart in spite of her frail appearance, Nestor quickly emerged as the spokesperson of the group. Within 10 days of the start of picketing, all demands had been met, including an end to “machine rent,” which operators had been forced to pay back to the company from their meagre wages, and the establishment of a union shop.
