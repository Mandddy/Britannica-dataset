Tillandsia,  the most widely distributed genus of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae), containing about 500 species of tropical American plants. They are mainly perennial herbs that are epiphytic (supported by other plants and having aerial roots exposed to the humid atmosphere).
The leaves of some members grow in rosettes; others hang loosely from their aerial perches. Those in rosettes often are flared and overlap at the base, forming a cup that holds rainwater. The leaves often are coloured or are grayish or silvery. The flowers are showy in some species, inconspicuous in others. Spanish moss (q.v.; T. usneoides) is sometimes used for packing or upholstery; T. xiphoides, a South American species, has strongly scented flowers that are sometimes used locally in medicines for respiratory diseases.
