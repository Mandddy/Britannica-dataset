Mahmoud Darwish , Arabic Maḥmūd Darwīsh  (born March 13, 1942, Al-Birwa, Palestine [now El-Birwa, Israel]—died Aug. 9, 2008, Houston, Texas, U.S.) Palestinian poet who gave voice to the struggles of the Palestinian people.
After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Darwish witnessed massacres that forced his family to escape to Lebanon. A year later their clandestine return to their homeland put them in limbo, as they were declared “present-absent aliens.” Darwish left El-Birwa a second time in 1970 and traveled to the Soviet Union to complete his education in Moscow. He lived in Cairo, Beirut, London, and Paris, as well as Tunis, Tun., before returning in 1996 to live in Palestine, in the West Bank town of Ramallah. He was a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and wrote the declaration of independence issued by the Palestine National Council in 1988, but he resigned from the PLO in 1993 to protest the signing of the Oslo Accords by PLO chairman Yasīr ʿArafāt. In 2000 the Israeli education minister made plans to include Darwish’s poems of reconciliation in the school curriculum, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak vetoed the plan.
