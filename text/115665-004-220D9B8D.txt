Sybil Ludington, married name Sybil Ogden  (born April 5, 1761, Fredericksburg [now Ludingtonville], New York [U.S.]—died February 26, 1839, Unadilla, New York, U.S.) American Revolutionary War heroine, remembered for her valiant role in defense against British attack.
Ludington was the daughter of Henry Ludington, a New York militia officer and later an aide to Gen. George Washington. According to accounts generally attributed to the Ludington family and first published more than 100 years later, on April 26, 1777, a messenger reached the Ludington house with news of Gov. William Tryon’s attack on Danbury, Connecticut, some 15 miles (25 km) to the southeast, where the munitions and stores for the militia of the entire region were stored. Colonel Ludington began immediately to organize the local militia. Whether Sybil volunteered (as is often recounted) or was directed by her father to bear the order for muster and to rouse the countryside is a matter of uncertainty. (The classic account of the event, an article written in 1907 by Ludington’s great-nephew Connecticut historian Louis S. Patrick, says her father “bade her to take a horse, ride for the men, and tell them to be at his house by daybreak.”) In either case, through the night the 16-year-old girl rode her horse nearly 40 miles (65 km) on unfamiliar roads around Putnam county, spreading the alarm. She ranged south to Mahopac and north to Stormville before returning home. In October 1784 Sybil married Edward Ogden, a lawyer, and she lived in Unadilla until her death.
