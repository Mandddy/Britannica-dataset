Charles-Marie de La Condamine,  (born January 28, 1701, Paris, France—died February 4, 1774, Paris) French naturalist, mathematician, and adventurer who accomplished the first scientific exploration of the Amazon River.
After finishing his basic education in Paris, La Condamine embarked on a military career. He left the army for a brief stint (1730–31) of scientific study at the Academy of Sciences in Paris before leaving in May 1731 for what would become a yearlong sea voyage to various ports along the Mediterranean Sea coast. Returning to Paris, he reported his scientific observations on the journey to the academy. The members were sufficiently impressed to invite him to join an expedition to Peru to determine the length near the Equator of a degree of the meridian (longitude).
