Arthur Schnitzler,  (born May 15, 1862, Vienna, Austriaâ€”died October 21, 1931, Vienna) Austrian playwright and novelist known for his psychological dramas that dissect turn-of-the-century Viennese bourgeois life.
Schnitzler, the son of a well-known Jewish physician, took a medical degree and practiced medicine for much of his life, interesting himself particularly in psychiatry. He made his name as a writer with Anatol (1893), a series of seven one-act plays depicting the casual amours of a wealthy young Viennese man-about-town. Although these plays were much less probing than his later works, they revealed a gift of characterization, a power to evoke moods, and a detached, often melancholic, humour.
