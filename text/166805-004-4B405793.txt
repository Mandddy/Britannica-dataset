Jonathan Toews,  (born April 29, 1988, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) Canadian professional ice hockey player who, with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), won three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, and 2015).
In 2005 Toews enrolled at the University of North Dakota, where he played centre on the school’s hockey team. He garnered attention for his offensive play, and in the 2006 NHL draft he was selected third overall by the Blackhawks, an “Original Six” team that had struggled in recent years. After his sophomore year at North Dakota, he left college to play professional hockey. During his first season with Chicago (2007–08), he scored 24 goals and was nominated for the Calder Trophy for best rookie in the NHL, an award won by his frequent linemate Patrick Kane; Kane and Toews were intended to be the core of the Blackhawks’s efforts to rebuild. Before the start of the 2008–09 season, Toews was named captain of the Blackhawks. In 2009 he appeared in his first All-Star Game, and he finished the regular season with 34 goals and 35 assists. Chicago made the play-offs for the first time since 2002, but they lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference finals.
