Steamboat, any watercraft propelled by steam, but more narrowly, a shallow-draft paddle wheel steamboat widely used on rivers in the 19th century, and particularly on the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries in the United States.
Steamboat pioneering began in America in 1787 when John Fitch made a successful trial of such a vessel. Robert Fulton’s profitable experimentation followed, but not until 1811 was a vessel built specifically to traverse the lower Mississippi River—the New Orleans, built at Pittsburgh, Pa., for Fulton and Robert R. Livingston. The two men began in 1812 the operation of a regular steamboat service between New Orleans and Natchez, Miss., under a monopoly contract with the territory of Orleans. Their vessels traveled at a rate of eight miles per hour downstream and three upstream. In 1816 Henry Miller Shreve of Shreveport, La., made history by launching his steamboat Washington; before long it was making the trip from New Orleans to Louisville, Ky., in 25 days. Shreve broke the Fulton-Livingston monopoly of steam navigation on the river, but his title as the father of Mississippi navigation stems more from his adaptations of steamboat design to fit the shallow waters of the river; he used a high-pressure steam engine (to make progress upstream), hoisted it high up above the water line, and mounted it on a hull that was as shallow as that of a barge. A tall second deck was added, and Shreve’s experiment became the prototype of all subsequent Mississippi steamboats. From then on and until about 1870, the steamboat dominated the economy, agriculture, and commerce of the middle area of the United States. In 1814 New Orleans had counted hardly 20 steamboat arrivals; within 20 years the figure had reached 1,200. The steamboats’ major cargoes were cotton and sugar, along with passengers.
