Pete Rose, in full Peter Edward Rose, byname Charlie Hustle  (born April 14, 1941, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.) professional baseball player who in 1985 exceeded Ty Cobb’s record for career hits (4,189). During his career Rose was noted for his all-around ability and enthusiasm. He was named Player of the Decade (1970–79) by The Sporting News. At the end of his career, he became better known for the accusations of gambling that led Major League Baseball to ban him from the sport in 1989.
Rose began to play in organized youth baseball at age eight. At his father’s insistence, he became a switch hitter (batting either right- or left-handed). At age 18 he signed with the National League (NL) Cincinnati Reds and, after three seasons in the minor leagues, Rose joined the Reds’ major league roster in 1963. Rose soon established himself at the top of the Reds’ batting order and was named NL Rookie of the Year at the end of the season. He led the league in batting in 1968 and 1969, and he enjoyed his finest season in 1973, winning his third batting title while collecting a career high 230 hits; he was named the NL’s Most Valuable Player that year. Rose was an integral part of the famed “Big Red Machine,” the Reds teams that from 1970 to 1976 won five division titles, four NL pennants, and World Series championships in 1975 and 1976.
