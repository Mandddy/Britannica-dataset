Ship of the line, type of sailing warship that formed the backbone of the Western world’s great navies from the mid-17th century through the mid-19th century, when it gave way to the steam-powered battleship.
The ship of the line evolved from the galleon, a three- or four-masted vessel that had a high superstructure on its stern and usually carried heavy guns along two decks. As fleets composed of these ships engaged in combat, they adopted a fighting formation called the line of battle, in which two opposing columns of ships maneuvered to fire their guns in broadside (a simultaneous discharge of all the guns arrayed on one side of a ship) against each other. Combat using these formations was known as line-of-battle warfare. Such battles were usually won by the heaviest ships carrying the biggest and most powerful guns. Therefore, a natural progression was toward fleets of big “line-of-battle ships,” or ships of the line.
