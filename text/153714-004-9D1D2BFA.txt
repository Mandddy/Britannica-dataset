Cheyenne River, river of eastern Wyoming and western South Dakota, U.S. It rises (as an intermittent stream) in northeastern Converse county, Wyoming, and runs eastward, its flow becoming permanent just before entering Fall River county, southwestern South Dakota. From there it flows northeastward across the state to join the Missouri River at the Cheyenne River Sioux reservation, north of Pierre (although the lowest section of its course is now an arm of Lake Oahe on the Missouri). The Cheyenne River flows 527 miles (848 km) and drains about 25,000 square miles (65,000 square km). Angostura Dam (impounding Angostura Reservoir), finished in 1949 as part of the Missouri River basin irrigation and flood-control project, is on the Cheyenne River near Hot Springs, South Dakota. The Cheyenne joins the Missouri at Lake Oahe, one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the United States.
