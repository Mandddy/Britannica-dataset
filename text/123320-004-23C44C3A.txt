Dunhuang, Wade-Giles romanization Tun-huang,  city, western Gansu sheng (province), northwestern China. Situated in an oasis in the Gansu-Xinjiang desert region, it is at the far western limit of traditional Chinese settlement along the Silk Road across Central Asia. Dunhuang was the first trading town reached by foreign merchants entering Chinese-administered territory from the west. The city is the site of the renowned Mogao Caves, which were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987. Pop. (2005) 140,000.
In ancient times Dunhuang was the point at which the two branches of the Silk Road, running around the Tarim Basin on the north and on the south, converged. It was first brought under Chinese control in the Han dynasty (206 bceâ€“220 ce) during an expansionist period at the end of the 2nd century bce. A Dunhuang commandery, separated from Jiuquan prefecture, was established there in 111 bce. A defensive line for protection from the Mongols was built to the north, and a sizable military force was stationed there. After the decay of Han central power, Dunhuang became semi-independent; in the 4th and 5th centuries ce, it successively formed part of kingdoms centred in Gansu. Throughout this period Dunhuang remained an important caravan town and commercial centre for trade with Central Asia.
