Will Rogers, in full William Penn Adair Rogers  (born Nov. 4, 1879, Cherokee Territory, U.S. (near present-day Claremore, Okla.)—died Aug. 15, 1935, near Point Barrow, Alaska) American entertainer, famous for his pithy and homespun humour.
Rogers learned how to ride a horse and do rope tricks while growing up on a ranch in what would eventually become Oklahoma. He worked in various Wild West shows in the United States and overseas, and in 1905 he displayed his roping skills at a horse show at Madison Square Garden. The good reviews he received for the engagement prompted his decision to stay in New York City and work in vaudeville. Upon discovering that audiences loved his Western drawl, he began to ad-lib patter in his previously silent act. Rogers appeared in his first Broadway show, The Wall Street Girl, in 1912 and demonstrated his roping skills between acts. He did the same in a few less successful shows in 1915, but he impressed producer Flo Ziegfeld enough to be hired later that year for the cast of Ziegfeld’s Midnight Frolic.
