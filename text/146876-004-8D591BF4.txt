Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), selective absorption of very high-frequency radio waves by certain atomic nuclei that are subjected to an appropriately strong stationary magnetic field. This phenomenon was first observed in 1946 by the physicists Felix Bloch and Edward M. Purcell independently of each other. Nuclei in which at least one proton or one neutron is unpaired act like tiny magnets, and a strong magnetic field exerts a force that causes them to precess in somewhat the same way that the axes of spinning tops trace out cone-shaped surfaces while they precess in the Earthâ€™s gravitational field. When the natural frequency of the precessing nuclear magnets corresponds to the frequency of a weak external radio wave striking the material, energy is absorbed from the radio wave. This selective absorption, called resonance, may be produced either by tuning the natural frequency of the nuclear magnets to that of a weak radio wave of fixed frequency or by tuning the frequency of the weak radio wave to that of the nuclear magnets (determined by the strong constant external magnetic field). See also magnetic resonance.
Nuclear magnetic resonance is used to measure nuclear magnetic moments, the characteristic magnetic behaviour of specific nuclei. Because these values are significantly modified by the immediate chemical environment, however, NMR measurements provide information about the molecular structure of various solids and liquids.
