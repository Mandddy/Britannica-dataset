George C. Scott, in full George Campbell Scott  (born October 18, 1927, Wise, Virginia, U.S.—died September 22, 1999, Westlake Village, California) American actor whose dynamic presence and raspy voice suited him to a variety of intense roles during his 40-year film career.
Scott was born in Virginia but reared and educated near Detroit. He served a four-year stint in the marines during the late 1940s before studying journalism and drama at the University of Missouri. He supported himself with several unskilled jobs throughout the early 1950s, taking numerous roles in television and repertory theatre productions. By 1957 Scott considered himself a failure at acting and was working as an IBM machine operator when he was cast in the title role in Joe Papp’s production of Shakespeare’s Richard III (1957). The production was a great critical success, and Scott’s performance was highly praised; one New York critic described Scott as “the meanest Richard III ever seen by human eyes.” For the next two years, he played a succession of quality roles in Off-Broadway and Broadway productions.
