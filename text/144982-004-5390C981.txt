Frick Collection,  gallery of paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts in New York City. The art, spanning the history of Western art from the Middle Ages to the late 19th century, was amassed by the industrialist Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919) under the guidance of the art dealer Joseph Duveen and the English art critic Roger Fry.
The collection, as well as an art reference library, is housed in Frick’s Manhattan townhouse. It includes decorative arts, drawings, furniture, paintings, prints, and sculpture.
