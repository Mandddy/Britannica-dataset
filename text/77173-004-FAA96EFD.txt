Miracle on 34th Street, American comedy film, released in 1947, that became a perennial family favourite at Christmastime.
Natalie Wood portrayed Susan Walker, a precocious little girl whose well-meaning mother (played by Maureen O’Hara) has raised her not to believe in Santa Claus. When their lives intersect with that of Kris Kringle (Edmund Gwenn), an elderly man hired to play Santa at New York City’s famous Macy’s department store, Susan begins to suspect he may be the real St. Nick. After a jealous fellow employee frames him for an assault, Kringle is placed in a mental hospital. At the ensuing sanity hearing, Kringle and his attorney attempt to prove that he is indeed Santa Claus.
