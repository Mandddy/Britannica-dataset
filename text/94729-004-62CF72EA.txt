Milwaukee Art Museum (MAM), museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, with a wide-ranging collection of ancient and contemporary art. The MAM collection is of international standing.
The history of the Milwaukee Art Museum dates to the 1880s, although the museum officially originated when the Milwaukee Art Association and the Layton Art Gallery merged their collections in the late 1950s. Located on the shores of Lake Michigan, MAM is a structural landmark both on the shoreline and in the city. It comprises three buildings, each designed in the postmodern tradition by a well-known architect. The museumâ€™s Quadracci Pavilion, completed in 2001 by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, features a moveable brise soleil, or sunscreen, with a 217-foot (66-metre) span.
