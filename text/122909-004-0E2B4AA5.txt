Spadefoot toad, relatively smooth-skinned amphibian of either the Old World genus Pelobates or of the genera Scaphiopus and Spea of North America. All spadefoot toads are classified in the family Pelobatidae. Spadefoot toads have a broad, horny “spade” projecting from the inside of each hind foot and used by the animals in burrowing.
The European spadefoot (Pelobates fuscus) is found in Europe and Central Asia, usually in sandy regions. Some related species have more restricted ranges. It is about 6 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) long and spends the day underground.
