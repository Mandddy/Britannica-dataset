Alexander I,  (born December 4 [December 16, New Style], 1888, Cetinje, Montenegro—died October 9, 1934, Marseille, France) king of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (1921–29) and of Yugoslavia (1929–34), who struggled to create a united state out of his politically and ethnically divided collection of nations.
He was the second son of Peter Karadjordjević—king of Serbia (1903–18) and king of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (1918–21)—and Zorka of Montenegro. Alexander spent his early youth in Geneva with his father, then in exile from Serbia, and in 1899 went to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Russian imperial corps of pages in 1904. In 1909, however, when his elder brother renounced his right of succession, Alexander, having become heir apparent, joined his family in Serbia.
