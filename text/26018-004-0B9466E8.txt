François-Juste-Marie Raynouard,  (born September 18, 1761, Brignoles, France—died October 27, 1836, Passy) French dramatist and Romance philologist who also played a part in the politics of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods.
Trained as a lawyer, Raynouard was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1791. In 1793 he was imprisoned on political grounds but was released in 1794 after the fall of Robespierre. His first play, Caton d’Utique (Cato of Utica), was published in 1794. After practicing law in his native Provence, he returned to Paris in 1803. In 1805 his second play, Les Templiers (The Knights Templars), was a great success, but his Les États de Blois; ou, la mort du duc de Guise (1810; “The Estate of Blois; or, The Death of the Duke of Guise”) offended Napoleon, and it was banned. Following the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, Raynouard left politics to devote himself to the study of the medieval troubadour poets of France. His writing in this field proved to be his most important and lasting accomplishment. He wrote Choix des poésies originales des troubadours, 6 vol. (1816–21; “Selected Poetry of the Troubadours”), which was published posthumously as a six-volume dictionary, Lexique roman (1839–44).
