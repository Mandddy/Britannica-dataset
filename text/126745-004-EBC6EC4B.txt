Halicarnassus, ancient Greek city of Caria, situated on the Gulf of Cerameicus. According to tradition, it was founded by Dorian Troezen in the Peloponnese. Herodotus, a Halicarnassian, relates that in early times the city participated in the Dorian festival of Apollo at Triopion, but its literature and culture appear thoroughly Ionic. The city, with its large sheltered harbour and key position on the sea routes, became the capital of the small despotate, the most famous ruler of which was a woman, Artemisia, who served under Xerxes in the invasion of Greece in 480 bc. Under Mausolus, when it was the capital of Caria (c. 370 bc), it received a great wall circuit, public buildings, and a secret dockyard and canal, while its population was swollen by the enforced transference of the neighbouring Lelegians. On the death of Mausolus in 353/352, a monumental tomb, the Mausoleum, considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World, was built by his widow in the city.
Under Memnon of Rhodes, a commander in Persian service, the city resisted Alexander the Great in 334 bc. It was subject to Antigonus I (311), Lysimachus (after 301), and the Ptolemies (281â€“197), but thereafter was independent until 129 bc, when it came under Roman rule. In early Christian times it was a bishopric.
