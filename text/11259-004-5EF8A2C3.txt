Hallstatt,  site in the Upper Austrian Salzkammergut region where objects characteristic of the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age (from c. 1100 bc) were first identified; the term Hallstatt now refers generally to late Bronze and early Iron Age culture in central and western Europe. During excavation between 1846 and 1899, more than 2,000 graves were found at Hallstatt. The majority fall into two groups, an earlier (c. 1100/1000 to c. 800/700 bc) and a later (c. 800/700 to 450 bc). Near the cemetery was a prehistoric salt mine; because of the preservative nature of the salt, implements, parts of clothing, and even the bodies of the miners themselves have been discovered.
Hallstatt remains are generally divided into four phases (A, B, C, and D), although there is some disagreement among scholars as to how these phases should be dated. In Phase A iron was rare, but Villanovan influences are apparent. Cremation was practiced in cemeteries of flat graves (or under very low mounds). The pottery in southwest Germany was thin walled, some of it betraying strong metallic influence, while farther east the Silesian influence (Lusatian B) is noticeable.
