White Nile River, Arabic Baḥr al-Abyaḍ ,  section of the Nile between Malakal, South Sudan, and Khartoum, Sudan. It is formed by the confluence of the Mountain Nile (Baḥr al-Jabal) and the Sobat River above Malakal, and it flows for about 500 miles (800 km) northeast and north past Al-Rank, Kūstī (railway bridge), Al-Duwaym, and Jabal al-Awliyāʾ (irrigation dam) to join the Blue Nile at Khartoum and form the Nile proper. This wide and shallow section of the river runs placidly along a small slope and is frequently fringed with swamps. The total length of the White Nile, including its major tributary, the Mountain Nile, is 1,295 miles (2,084 km).
During flood (June–September) the river provides less than 30 percent of the main Nile flow at Khartoum because the force of the floodwaters of the Blue Nile holds back the White Nile, turning it into a lake. At low water (April–May) the White Nile’s flow is uninhibited, and its contribution is more than 80 percent of total volume. The river is navigable all year by river steamer.
