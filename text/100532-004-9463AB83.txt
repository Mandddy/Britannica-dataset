Pesticide, any toxic substance used to kill animals or plants that cause economic damage to crop or ornamental plants or are hazardous to the health of domestic animals or humans. All pesticides interfere with normal metabolic processes in the pest organism and often are classified according to the type of organism they are intended to control. (See herbicide; insecticide; fungicide; fumigant.)
The use of certain pesticides is controversial. The insecticide DDT, for example, which came into wide use in the 1940s, was later heavily restricted in the United States because of its adverse affects on the health of the environment, wildlife, and humans. In the early 21st century the use of neonicotinoids was restricted in some countries because of the possible involvement of those insecticides in the decline of honeybee populations.
