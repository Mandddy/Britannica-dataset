Amnesty International (AI), international nongovernmental organization (NGO) founded in London on May 28, 1961, that seeks to publicize violations by governments and other entities of rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), especially freedom of speech and of conscience and the right against torture. AI actively seeks the release of political prisoners and the relief, when necessary, of their families. It also works with intergovernmental human rights bodies to expand and enforce human rights protections in international law. In 1977 AI was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. In the early 21st century the organization consisted of national sections, or offices, in more than 50 countries and some three million individual members, donors, and affiliated activists in more than 150 countries and territories. Its logo is a burning candle wrapped in barbed wire. Headquarters are in London.
The organization was founded through the principal efforts of the British attorney Peter Benenson, who had defended political prisoners in Hungary, South Africa, and Spain and who sought to establish a collective agency for the advancement of human rights. From 1961 to 1975 the chairman of AI was Se√°n MacBride, who was a corecipient of the 1974 Nobel Prize for Peace.
