Paul Laurence Dunbar,  (born June 27, 1872, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.—died Feb. 9, 1906, Dayton) U.S. author whose reputation rests upon his verse and short stories written in black dialect. He was the first black writer in the U.S. to make a concerted attempt to live by his writings and one of the first to attain national prominence.
Both of Dunbar’s parents were former slaves; his father escaped to freedom in Canada and then returned to the U.S. to fight in the Civil War. The young Dunbar was the only black student in his Dayton high school, where he was the popular editor of the school paper. He published his first volume of poetry, Oak and Ivy (1893), at his own expense while working as an elevator operator and sold copies to his passengers to pay for the printing. His second volume, Majors and Minors (1895), attracted the favourable notice of the novelist and critic William Dean Howells, who also introduced Dunbar’s next book, Lyrics of Lowly Life (1896), which contained some of the finest verses of the first two volumes.
