Philippe Desportes,  (born 1546, Chartres, France—died  Oct. 5, 1606, Abbey of Bonport) French courtier poet whose light, facile verse prepared the way for the new taste of the 17th century in France and whose sonnets served as models for the late Elizabethan poets.
Desportes based his style on that of the Italians—chiefly Petrarch, Ludovico Ariosto, and Pietro Bembo. About 1567 he displaced Pierre de Ronsard as the favourite poet of Henry, Duke d’Anjou, whom he accompanied to Kraków when Henry was elected king of Poland in 1573. With the publication that year of Desportes’ Premières Oeuvres (“First Works”), he became Ronsard’s rival. Desportes returned to France with Henry on the death of Charles IX (1574). He wrote sonnets and elegies, in graceful alexandrines, for Henry III and others to present to their mistresses. In 1583 he received the livings of the abbeys of Tiron and Josaphat, enjoying the revenues of other benefices also and entertaining an intellectual circle in a princely manner.
