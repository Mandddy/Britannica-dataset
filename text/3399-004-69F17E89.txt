Jean Passerat,  (born Oct. 18, 1534, Troyes, France—died  Sept. 14, 1602, Paris) French poet who composed elegant and tender verse and was one of the contributors to the “Satire Ménippée,” the manifesto of the moderate Royalist party in support of Henry of Navarre’s claim to the throne.
Passerat studied at the University of Paris, became a teacher at the Collège de Plessis, and in 1572 was made professor of Latin at the Collège de France, where he wrote scholarly Latin works and commentaries on Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius. He also composed poetry, his best pieces being “Ode du premier jour de mai” (“Ode on the First Day of May”) and the villanelle “J’ai perdu ma tourterelle” (“I Have Lost My Turtle Dove”). His exact share in the “Satire Ménippée” (1594) is variously stated, but it is generally agreed that he wrote much of the verse. His lines “Sur la journée de Senlis” (“On the Journey From Senlis”), in which he commends the Duke d’Aumale’s ability in running away, became a celebrated political song.
