Lucretia Mott, née Lucretia Coffin  (born Jan. 3, 1793, Nantucket, Mass., U.S.—died Nov. 11, 1880, near Abington, Pa.) pioneer reformer who, with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, founded the organized women’s rights movement in the United States.
Lucretia Coffin grew up in Boston, where she attended public school for two years in accordance with her father’s wish that she become familiar with the workings of democratic principles. At age 13 she was sent to a Friends’ (i.e., Quaker) boarding school near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where two years later she was engaged as an assistant and later as a teacher. It was then that her interest in women’s rights began. Solely because of her sex, she was paid only half the salary male teachers were receiving.
