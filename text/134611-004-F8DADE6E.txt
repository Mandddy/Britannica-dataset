Carl Loewe,  (born Nov. 30, 1796, Löbejün, near Halle, Brandenburg [Germany]—died  April 20, 1869, Kiel, Prussia) German composer and singer who is best-known for his songs, particularly his dramatic ballads.
Loewe began to compose while still a choirboy in Köthen and completed his musical training in Halle. He frequently toured Europe singing his songs with great success, and in Vienna he was called “the north German Schubert.” Although he wrote operas, oratorios, and much instrumental music, today he is almost exclusively known for his songs. Among these the most-admired include settings of Goethe’s Erlkönig, the Scottish folk ballad “Edward,” “Herr Oluf,” “Archibald Douglas,” and “Tom der Reimer.”
