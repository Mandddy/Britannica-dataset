Detective Story, American film noir, released in 1951, that is widely considered a classic police drama and is noted for its realism.
Kirk Douglas gave a critically acclaimed performance as Jim McLeod, a dedicated New York police detective who is fanatical in his enforcement of the law. A complex man hiding great psychological pains, he launches into violent rages at the slightest provocation. He is particularly angered when he has to interrogate an erudite abortionist (played by George Macready). McLeod later learns that before he met his wife (Eleanor Parker), she went to the doctor for an abortion. The news devastates McLeod and leads to tragedy.
