Jackie Collins, byname of Jacqueline Jill Collins  (born October 4, 1937, London, England—died September 19, 2015, Los Angeles, California) English author known for her provocative romantic thrillers, which were liberally salted with sex, crime, and entertainment-industry gossip. Collins’s glamorous public persona—she frequently appeared in leopard-print clothing and was adorned with expensive jewelry—echoed the lavish lifestyles of many of her characters. She sold more than 400 million copies of her books.
Collins, the middle child of a theatrical agent and a former dancer, was raised in London. After her constant misbehaviour led to her expulsion from an exclusive day school at age 15, she moved to Hollywood to live with her elder sister, actress Joan Collins. She returned to London following a yearlong interlude of partying with Joan’s film-industry friends. When her sporadic appearances in television productions and films during the 1950s and early ’60s failed to coalesce into an acting career, Collins turned instead to writing. At the urging of her second husband (her first marriage had ended in divorce nearly a decade earlier), she completed a half-formed novel about an affair between a married advertising executive and an aspiring actress. The resulting romp, The World Is Full of Married Men (1968; film 1979), became a succès de scandale as a result of its frank depictions of extramarital sex. It was banned in Australia and South Africa.
