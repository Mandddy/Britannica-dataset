Dōst Moḥammad Khān,  (born 1793, Afghanistan—died  June 9, 1863, Herāt) ruler of Afghanistan (1826–63) and founder of the Bārakzay dynasty, who maintained Afghan independence during a time when the nation was a focus of political struggles between Great Britain and Russia.
Dōst Moḥammad was one of a number of sons of Pāyenda Khān, head of the Bārakzay clan. In 1816 the clan rose in rebellion against the Afghan ruler Maḥmūd Shāh, who had put to death his prime minister, a member of the clan. Following eight years of civil war, the clan claimed victory. Dōst Moḥammad emerged as its most powerful member, and he ascended the throne in 1826.
