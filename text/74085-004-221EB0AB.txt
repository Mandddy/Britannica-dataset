Varaha, (
        Sanskrit: “Boar”) third of the 10 incarnations (avatars) of the Hindu god Vishnu. When a demon named Hiranyaksha dragged the earth to the bottom of the sea, Vishnu took the form of a boar in order to rescue it. They fought for a thousand years. Then Varaha slew the demon and raised the earth out of the water with his tusks. The myth reflects an earlier creation legend of Prajapati (Brahma), who assumed the shape of a boar in order to lift the earth up out of the primeval waters.
In painting and sculpture, Varaha is represented either in full animal form or with the head of a boar and the body of a man. Completely zoomorphic sculptures show him as a colossal boar with the earth, personified as the dark-hued goddess Bhumidevi, clinging to one of his tusks. As half-human, half-animal, he is often shown standing with one leg bent supporting Bhumidevi, whose expression, according to Indian canons of representation, should express both shyness and joy.
