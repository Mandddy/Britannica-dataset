Pietro da Cortona, French Pierre de Cortone, original name Pietro Berrettini   (born Nov. 1, 1596, Cortona, Tuscany [Italy]—died May 16, 1669, Rome, Papal States) Italian architect, painter, and decorator, an outstanding exponent of Baroque style.
Pietro studied in Rome from about 1612 under the minor Florentine painters Andrea Commodi and Baccio Ciarpi and was influenced by antique sculpture and the work of Raphael. The most important of his earliest paintings were three frescoes (1624–26) in Santa Bibiana, Rome. In the 1620s he designed the Villa del Pigneto near Rome and possibly another villa at Castel Fusano, both for his patrons, the Sacchetti family.
