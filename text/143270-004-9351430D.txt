Jelly, a semitransparent confection consisting of the strained juice of various fruits or vegetables, singly or in combination, sweetened, boiled, slowly simmered, and congealed, often with the aid of pectin, gelatin, or a similar substance.
The juices of most fruits and berries and many vegetables are suitable for processing into jelly. Juices high in pectin, such as those of citrus fruits and apples, congeal readily after cooking with sugar and may be added to the juices of low-pectin fruits, vegetables, and herbs, such as blueberries, green peppers, or mint, to promote gelling. Preserves, jams, conserves, and marmalades differ from jellies in their inclusion of whole fruit or fruit pulp.
