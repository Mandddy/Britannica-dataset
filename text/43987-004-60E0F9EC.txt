Alonso Cano,  (born March 19, 1601, Granada, Spain—died September 3, 1667, Granada) painter, sculptor, and architect, often called the Spanish Michelangelo for his diversity of talents. Although he led a remarkably tempestuous life, he produced religious works of elegance and ease.
Moving to Sevilla in 1614, Cano studied sculpture under Juan Martínez Montañés and painting under Francisco Pacheco. Forced to leave the city in 1638 because of a duel with the painter Sebastián de Llano y Valdés, he fled to Madrid and obtained the favour of the court. His activities as court painter ended in 1644, when, suspected of the murder of his wife, he had to escape to Valencia. Cano then returned to King Philip IV and successfully solicited a position as canon in the cathedral in Granada in 1652, but he was expelled for misbehaviour in 1656. Returning to Madrid, he took holy orders and was appointed chief architect of the Granada cathedral, a position he held until his death.
