Hail, precipitation of balls or pieces of ice with a diameter of 5 mm (about 0.2 inch) to more than 15 cm (about 6 inches). In contrast, ice pellets (sleet; sometimes called small hail) have a diameter less than 5 mm. Because the formation of hail usually requires cumulonimbus or other convective clouds with strong updrafts, it often accompanies thunderstorms.
Large hailstones are often characterized by alternating layers of clear and opaque ice, caused by irregular rates of freezing. In areas where the temperature is not far below 0 °C (32 °F), freezing occurs slowly, allowing trapped air to escape and producing clear ice. When the hailstone then moves into a much colder area, freezing occurs quickly, trapping air and producing a layer of white ice.
