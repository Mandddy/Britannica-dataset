To Kill a Mockingbird, American dramatic film, released in 1962, that was adapted from Harper Lee’s coming-of-age novel that addressed racism and injustice. The movie is widely regarded as an American classic.
To Kill a Mockingbird recounts the childhood experiences of six-year-old “Scout” Finch (played by Mary Badham) during the Great Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. When her widowed father (Gregory Peck), a principled and respected attorney, defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Scout and her brother witness the horrors of racism. They also learn valuable lessons about courage, compassion, tolerance, and prejudice.
