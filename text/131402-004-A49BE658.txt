Lathe, machine tool that performs turning operations in which unwanted material is removed from a workpiece rotated against a cutting tool.
The lathe is one of the oldest and most important machine tools. Wood lathes were in use in France as early as 1569. During the Industrial Revolution in England the machine was adapted for metal cutting. The rotating horizontal spindle to which the workholding device is attached is usually power driven at speeds that can be varied. On a speed lathe the cutting tool is supported on a tool rest and manipulated by hand. On an engine lathe the tool is clamped onto a cross slide that is power driven on straight paths parallel or perpendicular to the work axis. On a screwcutting lathe the motion of the cutting tool is accurately related to the rotation of the spindle by means of a lead screw that drives the carriage on which the cutting tool is mounted.
