Archer fish, any of seven species of Indo-Pacific fishes of the family Toxotidae (order Perciformes) noted for their ability to knock their insect prey off overhanging vegetation by “shooting” it with drops of water expelled from the fish’s mouth. The insect falls into the water, where it can be eaten by the fish. Archer fishes are elongated, with relatively deep bodies that are almost flat from the dorsal fin forward. The head is pointed, the mouth is large, and the dorsal and anal fins are placed toward the back of the body. Different species are spotted or vertically banded with black.
Archer fishes live in both fresh and brackish salt water, usually remaining near the surface. One of the best-known species is Toxotes jaculator (or T. jaculatrix), which grows about 18 cm (7 inches) long.
