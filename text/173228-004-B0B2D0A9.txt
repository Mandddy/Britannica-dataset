José Joaquín Olmedo, also called José Joaquín de Olmedo  (born March 20, 1780, Guayaquil, New Granada [now in Ecuador]—died February 19, 1847, Guayaquil, Ecuador) poet and statesman whose odes commemorating South America’s achievement of independence from Spain captured the revolutionary spirit of his time and inspired a generation of Romantic poets and patriots. They have remained monuments to the heroic figures of the liberation movement in South America.
After receiving his degree in law in 1805 from the University of San Marcos in Lima, Peru, Olmedo was sent to Spain in 1811 to represent Guayaquil in the Cortes de Cádiz, the revolutionary parliament that promulgated the liberal constitution of 1812.
