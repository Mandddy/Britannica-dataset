Shield-backed katydid (subfamily Tettigoniinae), any of a group of insects (family Tettigoniidae, order Orthoptera) that are cricketlike in appearance and are named for the enlarged pronotum (dorsal surface of the prothorax), which typically extends to the abdomen. Most shield-backed katydids are from about 18 to 50 mm (0.7 to 2 inches) in length and are brown or black in colour; a few species are green. Most species have short wings, although in some species wings are significantly reduced or are absent in at least one sex; some species are flightless as a result.
The Mormon cricket (Anabrus simplex) is a well-known wingless species of shield-backed katydid in North America, where it once was a serious pest in the Great Plains. In 1848 at Salt Lake City, Deseret (later Utah), the arrival of a flock of sea gulls saved the Mormonsâ€™ crops from complete destruction by the insect. When present in sufficient numbers, the coulee cricket (Peranabrus scabricollis) is a destructive pest of plants in the Pacific Northwest. Insecticides and insecticidal baits are used to control populations and migrating bands of Mormon crickets and coulee crickets; past methods of control included the creation of ditches or the erection of vertical metal barriers around crop plants.
