Sarajevo 1984 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in Sarajevo, Yugos., that took place Feb. 8â€“19, 1984. The Sarajevo Games were the 14th occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
The awarding of the 14th Winter Olympics to Sarajevo (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina) caught many by surprise, including the host country, which went to work building new facilities and making improvements to others in order to accommodate the Games. The choice of Sarajevo proved appropriate, however, as the 1984 Games were highlighted by the appearance of smaller countries. In order to encourage participation, the International Olympic Committee agreed to pay the expenses of one male and one female participant from each country. Egypt, the British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Puerto Rico, and Senegal made their Winter Olympics debuts as a Winter Games-record number of national Olympic committees (49) competed at Sarajevo. The Olympics were a triumph for Yugoslavia.
