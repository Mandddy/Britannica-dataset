Surfperch, also called seaperch,  any of 23 species of fishes of the family Embiotocidae (order Perciformes). Surfperches are found in the North Pacific Ocean; three or four species are native to Japanese waters, but all others are confined to the North American coast, mostly off California. One species, the tule perch (Hysterocarpus traski), inhabits freshwater. All species are unusual among marine fishes in giving birth to live young rather than laying eggs.
Surfperches are relatively deep-bodied and have small mouths, large scales, and a single, long dorsal fin. The species range in length from 13 to 45 cm (5 to 18 inches). The barred surfperch (Amphistichus argenteus), marked with yellow stripes, is one of several species favoured by anglers.
