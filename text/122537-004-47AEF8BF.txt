Fontina,  semihard cow’s-milk cheese that originated in the Valle d’Aosta region of northern Italy. Made in wheels 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm) in diameter and 3 to 4 inches (about 8 to 10 cm) thick, Fontina has a tough, beige natural rind, sometimes coated in wax, and a pale gold interior with a few small holes. The characteristic flavour of Fontina is mild but distinctively nutty and savoury. Fontinas from Sweden, Denmark, and the United States have milder flavour, softer texture, and more holes than those of Italy.
The European Economic Community protects the designation Fontina; similar cheeses that are produced outside Valle d’Aosta but within the Common Market are generally known as fontal.
