Sir James Dyson,  (born May 2, 1947, Cromer, Norfolk, Eng.) British inventor, industrial designer, and entrepreneur who successfully manufactured innovative household appliances and became a determined campaigner to restore engineering and technical innovation to high esteem in British society.
As a boy, Dyson attended the prestigious Gresham’s schools in rural Holt, North Norfolk. After graduation he went to London, where he attended the Byam Shaw School of Art for a year (1965–66) before studying furniture and interior design at the Royal College of Art (1966–70). At the latter institution he was introduced to the creative possibilities of uniting engineering with design. In 1970 he went to work for Rotork Controls Ltd., Bath, Somerset, where he and the company’s unconventional chairman, Jeremy Fry, designed and produced the Sea Truck, a small, fast, versatile flat-bottomed fibreglass landing craft for use by military or civilian customers. In 1974 Dyson founded his own company to produce the Ballbarrow, a plastic wheelbarrow-like bin that rolled on a load-spreading ball instead of a narrow wheel.
