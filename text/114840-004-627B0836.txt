Snowboarding, winter sport that is somewhat akin to skiing and that evolved from skateboarding and surfing. Three main styles of competition exist: Alpine, freestyle, and boardercross.
Developed in the 1960s, snowboarding is believed to have originated in the United States, where several inventors explored the idea of surfing on the snow. The sport quickly evolved, and the early, rudimentary boards gave way to designs that are specialized to meet the demands of different competitions. The basic design is a board (much like an oversized, wheel-less skateboard) to which the rider’s feet are attached with bindings. No poles are used; racers push off from stationary posts. The size and shape of a snowboard varies according to the intended use of the board and the size of the snowboarder. However, the average size of a board is 150 cm (5 feet) in length and 25 cm (10 inches) in width. A board may have a deep sidecut (giving it a shape similar to an hourglass) in order to facilitate sharper turns. A leash connected to the snowboarder’s ankle prevents the board from sliding away after a fall.
