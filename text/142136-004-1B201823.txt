Horned toad, also called horned lizard,  (genus Phrynosoma), any of about 14 species of lizards belonging to the family Iguanidae that are usually characterized by daggerlike head spines, or horns; a flattened oval body, pointed fringe scales along the sides of the body, and a short tail are typical features. The lizards range in length from less than 7.5 to more than 12.5 cm (3 to 5 inches).
They inhabit western North America from British Columbia southward to Guatemala and from Arkansas and Kansas westward to the Pacific coast. The usual habitat is desert or semidesert sandy country. Horned toads conceal themselves by colour-pattern change and by wriggling sideways into the sand until the entire body, except the head, is covered. They are food specialists, eating mainly ants. The horned toads include both egg-laying and live-bearing species.
