Charleston, county, southern South Carolina, U.S. It comprises a low-lying coastal region with numerous swamps and marshy areas. A portion of the Sea Islands, strung along the Atlantic coast, form the southeastern border; rivers and the Intracoastal Waterway separate the islands from the mainland. The northern end of this long, narrow county includes Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge on the Sea Islands and, inland, part of Francis Marion National Forest. In the unique environment of Kiawah Island, which includes salt marshes, woods, and sandy beaches, lives a wide variety of wildlife, including alligators, 140 species of birds, and the endangered Atlantic loggerhead sea turtle. Charles Towne Landing and Hampton Plantation state parks lie within Charleston county.
Cusabo Indians inhabited the region when European colonists arrived in the 1670s. In June 1776 colonial patriots led by William Moultrie defended a fort on Sullivan’s Island and thereby saved Charleston from British attack. Charleston county was established in 1785 and named for Charles II of England. Fort Sumter National Monument, in Charleston Harbor, marks the site of the opening battle of the American Civil War. The area became the centre of Confederate blockade running, and Confederate forces introduced submarine warfare there in 1863–64.
