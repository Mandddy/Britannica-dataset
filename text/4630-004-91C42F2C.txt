Cassegrain reflector, in astronomical telescopy, an arrangement of mirrors to focus incoming light at a point close to the main light-gathering mirror. The design was proposed in 1672 by French priest Laurent Cassegrain.
In the Cassegrain reflector, parallel rays of light entering the telescope are reflected from a large concave mirror toward the focal point of that mirror, which is called the prime focus of the telescope. Before reaching the prime focus, the light rays are reflected again by a small convex mirror that brings them to a focus near a small hole in the centre of the main mirror.
