Optic atrophy, degeneration of the optic nerve (the second cranial nerve) due to direct or indirect damage to a particular type of retinal cell, called ganglion cells, whose axonal projections collectively make up the optic nerve. The function of the optic nerve is to carry visual data from the retina of the eye to the lateral geniculate body (a relay station in the centre of the brain) for transmission to a cortical area at the back of the brain called the occipital cortex. Common causes of optic atrophy include glaucoma, tumours that press on the optic nerve, vascular (blood vessel) diseases, optic neuritis, trauma, and exposure to various drugs and toxins. The atrophy may be a hereditary defect, such as in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), which predominantly affects males between the ages of 15 and 25. There is sometimes recovery of vision in LHON, but it is rarely complete. Treatment of optic atrophy and degeneration is aimed at correcting the underlying condition to prevent further optic nerve damage.
