Albert Roussel,  (born April 5, 1869, Tourcoing, Fr.—died  Aug. 23, 1937, Royan) French composer who wrote in various styles and whose music is notable for its lyrical fervour, austerity of technique, and harmonic audacity.
Roussel joined the French navy at the age of 18 and made several journeys to Southeast Asia, the exotic impressions of which he recalled in later orchestral and dramatic works. At 25 he resigned his naval commission and became a pupil of Vincent d’Indy at the Schola Cantorum in Paris. From 1902 to 1914 he taught composition at the Schola Cantorum; his pupils included Erik Satie and Edgard Varèse. In 1909–10 he traveled again to Southeast Asia, and to India. Service at the front with the Red Cross in World War I undermined his health, and he retired to Brittany in 1918, subsequently devoting himself to composition.
