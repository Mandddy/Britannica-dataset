Luiz Alves de Lima e Silva, duke de Caxias,  (born August 25, 1803, Rio de Janeiro—died May 7, 1880, Rio de Janeiro) military hero and statesman who gave the military a prominent position in the government of the Brazilian empire.
Caxias kept up his family’s tradition by joining the military service at age 14, and within a year he was promoted to second lieutenant. At 21 he was appointed adjutant of the battalion of the emperor. Caxias first displayed his military skills during the war of independence (1823) in the state of Bahia. On April 7, 1831, the emperor Pedro I abdicated, and Caxias organized a battalion to police Rio de Janeiro until a new government was formed, one that featured his father as co-regent. After becoming governor of the state of Maranhão in 1837, Caxias was elected to Brazil’s House of Deputies in 1840.
