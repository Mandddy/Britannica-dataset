Léonide Massine, original name Leonid Fyodorovich Miassin  (born July 28 [August 9, New Style], 1896, Moscow—died March 15, 1979, Cologne, West Germany) Russian dancer and innovative choreographer of more than 50 ballets, one of the most important figures in 20th-century dance.
Massine studied acting and dancing at the Imperial School in Moscow and had almost decided to become an actor when Serge Diaghilev, seeking a replacement for Vaslav Nijinsky, invited Massine to join his company. After a few months of study under Italian dancer and teacher Enrico Cecchetti, Massine made his Paris debut in La Légende de Joseph in 1914 and received favourable comment on his dramatic dance ability and commanding stage personality. Diaghilev supervised his artistic education, taking him to museums and concerts and introducing him to such people as the Russian painter Mikhail Larionov, the conductor Ernest Ansermet, and the composer Igor Stravinsky, all of whom influenced Massine’s approach to dance. Diaghilev also encouraged his choreographic talent. Massine’s first work as a choreographer, Le Soleil de nuit, was produced in 1915 and was eventually followed by such masterpieces as La Boutique fantasque (1919), Le Tricorne (1919; The Three-Cornered Hat), Le Beau Danube (1924), and Gaîté Parisienne (1938). Massine extended Michel Fokine’s choreographic reforms by enriching and clarifying narration and characterizations. His ballets incorporated both folk dance and the demi-caractère dance, a style that uses classical technique to perform character dance. He added variety and complexity by including synchronized yet individual or small-group dance patterns within the corps de ballet.
