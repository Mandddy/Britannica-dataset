Kawatake Mokuami, original name Yoshimura Yoshisaburō, also called Kawatake Shinshichi II or Furukawa Mokuami  (born March 1, 1816, Edo [now Tokyo], Japan—died  Jan. 22, 1893, Tokyo) versatile and prolific Japanese dramatist, the last great Kabuki playwright of the Tokugawa period (1603–1867).
Growing up in Edo, Kawatake became a pupil of the Kabuki playwright Tsuruya Namboku V and wrote many kinds of plays during a long apprenticeship. He became the chief playwright for the Kawarasaki Theatre in 1843. During his 40s, Kawatake established his reputation writing sewamono, domestic plays featuring the lives of ordinary townspeople, and shiranamimono, picaresque plays portraying the lives of thieves and other minor criminals. He wrote many such plays for the noted actor Ichikawa Kodanji IV until the latter’s death in 1866.
