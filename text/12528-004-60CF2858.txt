William Cunningham,  (born December 29, 1849, Edinburgh, Scotland—died June 10, 1919, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England) British economist and clergyman who was largely responsible for the establishment of economic history as a scholastic discipline in British universities. Cunningham was ordained in the Church of England in 1873 and became vicar of Great St. Mary’s, Cambridge (1887), and archdeacon of Ely (1906). From 1891 to 1897 he was a professor of economics at King’s College, London. His The Growth of English Industry and Commerce (1882; later expanded to 3 volumes), one of the first systematic economic histories of England, became a standard reference work.
Over his career, Cunningham grew increasingly skeptical of economic theory and attacked the leading economist of the late 19th century, Alfred Marshall, for basing economic history on general principles rather than on empirical data. Cunningham also developed an increasingly protectionist outlook, shifting from a belief in free trade and internationalism to a belief in trade barriers, a strong nation-state, and British imperialism.
