Roberto Carlos, in full Roberto Carlos Braga  (born April 19, 1941, Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Espírito Santo state, Brazil) Brazilian singer-songwriter who was at the forefront of the 1960s rock-and-roll movement in Brazil and later became hugely popular as a performer of romantic ballads and boleros.
Carlos was born into a lower-middle-class family and displayed an early affinity for music, making his vocal debut on a local radio station at age nine. As a teenager he moved to the Rio de Janeiro area and formed a band inspired by the music of such American rock-and-roll progenitors as Elvis Presley and Bill Haley. The band, originally called the Snacks and later the Sputniks, performed on television and at various local celebrations. In 1959 Carlos embarked on a solo career as a bossa nova musician in the vein of the widely popular Brazilian singer João Gilberto. Carlos failed to attain similar commercial success, however, and after releasing his first full-length album, Louco por você (1961; “Crazy for You”), he returned to rock music.
