Sir Arthur William Currie,  (born Dec. 5, 1875, Napperton, Ont., Can.—died Nov. 30, 1933, Montreal) the first Canadian commander, from 1917, of Canada’s overseas forces in World War I.
Currie taught school before going into business in Victoria, B.C. He enlisted in the militia and rose from the ranks to become lieutenant colonel of artillery. In spite of this minimum of professional training, he was given command of a battalion in the first Canadian contingent sent to assist Britain in 1914. He advanced steadily, winning distinction at the battles of Ypres and Saint-Julien in Belgium and at the battle of Vimy Ridge in France. Within three years he became lieutenant general and commander of the four divisions of the Canadian Corps, succeeding the British general Sir Julian Byng. He was one of the most successful and effective corps commanders in any army during the war’s final months. Currie was knighted in 1918. After the war Currie served as inspector general of the Canadian militia and became the first general in the Canadian Army. In 1920 he accepted the position of principal and vice chancellor of McGill University, Montreal, and retained this post until his death.
