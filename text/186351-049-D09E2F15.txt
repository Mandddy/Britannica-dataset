Vital sign, any of certain basic physiologic measures used in the initial clinical assessment of a patient during a physicianâ€™s examination. The vital signs of temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure all reflect the general physiologic state as well as specific disease states. Changes in these signs are frequently associated with severe illness, although regular variations among different individuals and at various times in a single individual may be normal. Deviations from normal ranges in more than one of the vital signs, however, usually represent some physiologic disturbance.
