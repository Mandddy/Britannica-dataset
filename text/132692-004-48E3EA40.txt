Ralph Lauren, original name Ralph Rueben Lifshitz  (born October 14, 1939, New York, New York, U.S.) American fashion designer who, by developing his brand around the image of an elite American lifestyle, built one of the worldâ€™s most successful fashion empires.
Lifshitz grew up in the Bronx, in New York City. He and his brother changed their last name to Lauren when they were teenagers. After high school, he took business classes at night school and worked in sales by day. While working for a tie company, he was inspired to begin designing his own neckwear, and in 1967 he went into business for himself, marketing his unique line of ties under the name Polo.
