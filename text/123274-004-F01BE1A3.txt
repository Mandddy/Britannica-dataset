Canaan dog, breed of herding dog developed in Israel in the 20th century from semiwild pariah dogs that were the descendants of animals present in the region since biblical times. Over time they had been utilized as guardians and hunting dogs, but most had reverted to a wild state, living in desert areas. In the 1930s a breeding program was begun to redomesticate these wild dogs to serve as guards for the isolated kibbutzim. In wartime the dogs served as messengers and sentries and proved adept at locating land mines. In 1949 the Institute for Orientation and Mobility of the Blind took over the breeding of the Canaan dog, with about 150 kennel-raised dogs constituting the stock.
The Canaan dogs are hardy, intelligent, and trainable and must be well socialized. They have been put to work for herding, guarding, and tracking and as guide dogs. They are aloof and cautious with strangers and in unfamiliar situations but loyal to their families. They tend to be vocal and playful. Of medium size, they stand 19 to 24 inches (48 to 61 cm) tall and weigh 35 to 55 pounds (16 to 25 kg). They have upright ears, a wedge-shaped head, and a bushy tail that tends to curl over the back. Their short, harsh, double coat may be white with large markings in brown, black, or red and often with a mask or hood of the contrasting colour, or it may be solid with some white markings. Solid-coloured dogs may be black or any shade of brown.
