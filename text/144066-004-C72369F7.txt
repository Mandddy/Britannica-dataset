Chagres River, Spanish Río Chagres,  stream in Panama forming part of the Panama Canal system. It rises in the Cordillera de San Blas, flows south-southwest, and broadens to form Madden Lake (22 square miles [57 square km]) at Madden Dam, which was built in 1935 for navigation, flood control, and hydroelectric power. Below the dam it continues southwest to Gamboa, where it joins the Panama Canal at the north end of the Gaillard Cut. Its course then turns northward through Gatún Lake, created by the Gatún Dam (1912) with which are associated locks and a hydroelectric plant. The Chagres there leaves the canal and flows into the Caribbean Sea west of Limón Bay. Originally characterized by rapids throughout, the river is navigable only in its canalized portions. The river supplies much of the water needed to operate the canal, and it is the source for most of Panama City’s water supply. Its resources are increasingly strained and the water quality threatened. Deforestation around the river basin has been a problem. Deforested slopes cannot absorb heavy rains, which overflow into Gatún Lake and out to the sea, making lockage difficult and causing eroded sediment to fill up the lake bottom.
