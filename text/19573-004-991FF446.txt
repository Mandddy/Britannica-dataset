Innsbruck 1964 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in Innsbruck, Austria, that took place Jan. 29â€“Feb. 9, 1964. The Innsbruck Games were the ninth occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
After having narrowly lost the 1960 Games to Squaw Valley, Calif., U.S., Innsbruck was awarded the 1964 Winter Olympics. It proved well worth the wait. Innsbruck became the first Olympic city to hold events throughout the surrounding area, enabling more than one million spectators to watch the contests. In addition, more than one billion television viewers tuned in to the Games. Computers made their Olympic debut, allowing for more accurate scoring and the smoother running of events. For the first time in a Winter Games, the Olympic torch was lit in ancient Olympia, Greece, and then relayed to Innsbruck. The only major problem was the lack of snow. The country suffered its mildest February in almost 60 years, forcing the Austrian army to carry in more than 25,000 tons of snow for the Alpine ski events.
