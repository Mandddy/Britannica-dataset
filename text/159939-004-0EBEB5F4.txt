Lion’s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata), marine jellyfish of the class Scyphozoa (phylum Cnidaria) found in the waters of the colder oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. Some populations, however, occur as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. It is the largest known jellyfish in the world.
The body of the lion’s mane jellyfish is characterized by an eight-lobed bell with 70–150 trailing tentacles. The colour of the bell in smaller individuals ranges from light orange to tan, whereas that of larger specimens ranges from deep orange to dark crimson. The largest individuals, which are found in the Arctic Ocean, measure as much as 2.4 metres (8 feet) in diameter and 36.5 metres (about 120 feet) in length—about 7 metres (about 23 feet) longer than the longest known blue whale.
