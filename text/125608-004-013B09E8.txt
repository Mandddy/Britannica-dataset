Pickerel frog,  (Rana palustris), dark-spotted frog (family Ranidae), found in eastern North America, usually in such areas as meadows, cool streams, and sphagnum bogs. The pickerel frog is about 5 to 7.5 centimetres (2 to 3 inches) long and has lengthwise rows of squarish spots on its golden or brownish skin.
When the pickerel frog leaps it reveals the orange or yellow on the inner surfaces of its hind legs. The skin secretions, which protect this frog from snakes, are reported also to be toxic to other frogs.
