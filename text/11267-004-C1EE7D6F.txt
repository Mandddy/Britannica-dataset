Carl Christian Hall,  (born Feb. 25, 1812, Copenhagen, Den.—died  Aug. 14, 1888, Copenhagen) Danish politician whose policies led Denmark into a disastrous war with Germany.
Hall was educated in the law, and in 1848 he became a leader of the National Liberal Party. He served as minister of church, education, and culture in 1854–57. He supported his party’s old Eider policy favouring the incorporation of the duchy of Schleswig into the Danish state. As prime minister, from 1857 (and also as foreign minister from 1858) he tried to draw Schleswig closer to Denmark, despite Prussian objections. Hall pushed through the November constitution of 1863, which incorporated Schleswig into Denmark and which soon led to war with the German states. He declined participation in a new government led by his fellow National Liberal Ditlev Gothard Monrad, which was formed in December 1863. The war proved disastrous for Denmark in the next year, and Hall urged and won acceptance of humiliating peace terms, which separated Schleswig and Holstein from the Danish monarchy and ceded them to Prussia and Austria.
