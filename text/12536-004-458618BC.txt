Richard Cumberland,  (born Feb. 19, 1732, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, Eng.—died  May 7, 1811, London) English dramatist whose plays were in tune with the sentimental spirit that became an important literary force during the latter half of the 18th century. He was a master of stagecraft, a good observer of men and manners, but today perhaps is chiefly famous as the model for the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s play The Critic; or a Tragedy Rehearsed.
After leaving Trinity College, Cambridge, Cumberland in 1761 became private secretary to the Earl of Halifax in the Duke of Newcastle’s ministry and later held other government positions. His first success as a dramatist came with The Brothers (1769), a sentimental comedy whose plot is reminiscent of Henry Fielding’s novel Tom Jones, and he continued to write prolifically. The West Indian (1771) was first produced by the great actor-manager David Garrick and held the stage throughout the 18th century. Despite its fantastic plot and crude psychology, a great deal of feeling is extracted from the situations. The Fashionable Lover, another sentimental comedy, achieved success in 1772.
