E.B. White, in full Elwyn Brooks White  (born July 11, 1899, Mount Vernon, New York, U.S.—died October 1, 1985, North Brooklin, Maine) American essayist, author, and literary stylist, whose eloquent, unaffected prose appealed to readers of all ages.
White graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1921 and worked as a reporter and freelance writer before joining The New Yorker magazine as a writer and contributing editor in 1927. He married Katherine Sergeant Angell, The New Yorker’s first fiction editor, in 1929, and he remained with the weekly magazine for the rest of his career. White’s essays for The New Yorker quickly garnered critical praise. Written in a personal, direct style that showcased an affable sense of humour, his witty pieces contained musings about city life, politics, and literature, among other subjects. White also wrote poems, cartoon captions, and brief sketches for the magazine, and his writings helped establish its intellectual and cosmopolitan tone. White collaborated with James Thurber on Is Sex Necessary? (1929), a spoof of contemporary sex manuals. In a monthly column (1938–43) for Harper’s magazine, he wrote essays about rural life.
