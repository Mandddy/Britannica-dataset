Delaware River,  river of the Atlantic slope of the United States, meeting tidewater at Trenton, N.J., about 130 miles (210 km) above its mouth. Its total length (including the longest branch) is about 405 miles (650 km), and the river drains an area of 11,440 square miles (29,630 square km). The river constitutes in part the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, the boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and, for a few miles, the boundary between Delaware and New Jersey. The riverâ€™s course is basically to the south.
The main, or west, branch rises in Schoharie county, N.Y., at a point 1,886 feet (575 m) above sea level. The river cuts deeply through a plateau until it emerges from the Catskill Mountains. Leaving the mountains and plateau, the river flows down Appalachian valleys, skirts the Kittatinny Mountains, which it crosses at Delaware Water Gap (a national recreation area) between nearly vertical walls of sandstone, and passes through an area of farms and forests until it enters hills again at Easton, Pa. From this point, it is flanked at intervals by hills and in places by cliffs, including the Nockamixon Rocks, 3 miles (5 km) long and more than 200 feet (60 m) high. At Trenton there is a fall of 8 feet (2 m).
