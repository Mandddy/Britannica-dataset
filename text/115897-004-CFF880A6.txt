Cheshire, geographic and historic county and former administrative county of northwestern England, bordering Wales to the west, fronting the Dee and Mersey estuaries to the northwest, and flanked by the Pennine uplands, partly within the Peak District National Park, to the east. In 2009 the administrative county of Cheshire, which had comprised six districts—the city of Chester and the boroughs of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, Ellesmere Port and Neston, Macclesfield, and Vale Royal—was abolished and reconstituted as two unitary authorities, Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester. The geographic county comprises the entire former administrative county and the unitary authorities of Halton and Warrington. The historic county excludes the parts of the two unitary authorities north of the River Mersey, which belong to the historic county of Lancashire, but it encompasses several areas outside the geographic county: the metropolitan borough of Wirral in the metropolitan county of Merseyside; the part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester south of the Rivers Mersey and Tame (below Mossley), including parts of the metropolitan boroughs of Oldham, Tameside, Stockport, Manchester, and Trafford; and the north side of Langdendale, in the High Peak district of the administrative county of Derbyshire.
Most of the geographic county is underlain by Triassic sandstones and marls, which give a distinctive red colouring to many soils and building stones in churches. Atop the simple structure of the Cheshire Plain, however, lies a highly fragmented pattern of glacial clays, sands, and gravels, meandering rivers, and scattered distinctive small lakes, or meres.
