Grande Dixence Dam, gravity dam on the Dixence River, Switzerland, completed in 1961. It is 935 feet (285 metres) high and 2,280 feet (695 metres) wide at the crest, has a volume of 7,848,000 cubic yards (6,000,000 cubic metres), and impounds a reservoir of 325,000 acre-feet (401,000,000 cubic metres).
Grande Dixence was the tallest dam in the world until completion of the Nurek Dam in the Soviet Union in 1980. It was built in annual stages, a procedure necessary because the Alpine working season is quite short.
