Tone River, Japanese Tone-gawa,  major river of the Kantō Plain, Honshu, Japan. It rises in the volcanic area of northwestern Kantō chihō (region), about 35 miles (56 km) north of Maebashi in Gumma ken (prefecture). The river flows for 200 miles (320 km) south and southeast through the centre of the Kantō Plain to enter the Pacific Ocean at Chōshi in Chiba ken, near Cape Inubō. It was once known as Bandō Tarō, the principal river of Japan in the Bandō (now Kantō) region.
No other river in Japan has been so modified by human activity. Its entire length has been embanked with dikes, and the course itself often has been altered. The most notable alteration was completed in 1654, when the lower course was diverted from draining into Tokyo Bay and channeled into its present outlet.
