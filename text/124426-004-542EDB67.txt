Parvati, (
        Sanskrit: “Daughter of the Mountain”) also called Uma,  wife of the Hindu god Shiva. Parvati is a benevolent goddess.
Born the daughter of a mountain called Himalaya, she won Shiva’s affection only after undergoing severe ascetic discipline. The couple had two children. The Mahabharata, the Ramayana, Kalidasa’s poem Kumarasambhava (“The Birth of Kumara”), and the Puranas all relate that their son Kumara (Skanda) was born without her agency from Shiva’s seed. The Puranas also tell how, against Shiva’s will, Parvati created their other son, the elephant-headed Ganesha. Parvati is often represented in sculpture with Shiva—as an attendant figure, or looking on as he performs a miraculous feat, or engaged in a game with him in their mountain kingdom of Kailasa—and is always depicted as a mature and beautiful woman. The Tantras—texts of sects worshipping Shiva—are written as a discussion between Parvati and Shiva.
