Urban VI, original name Bartolomeo Prignano   (born c. 1318, Naples—died Oct. 15, 1389, Rome) pope from 1378 to 1389 whose election sparked the Western Schism (1378–1417).
Archbishop first of Acerenza (1363) and then of Bari (1377), he became papal chancellor for Pope Gregory XI, whom he was elected to succeed on April 8, 1378. This election of an Italian appeased the Romans, who were determined to end the French-dominated papacy at Avignon (1309–77).
