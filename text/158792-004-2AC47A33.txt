Fritillary, name applied to butterflies in several genera (family Nymphalidae). Large fritillaries, or silverspots, belong to the genus Speyeria and usually have silver markings on the underside of their wings. Many of the smaller fritillaries are members of the genus Boloria. Many fritillary larvae are nocturnal and feed on violet leaves.
