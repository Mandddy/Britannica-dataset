Hadji Agus Salim,  (born Oct. 8, 1884, Kota Gedang, Sumatra, Dutch East Indies [now Indonesia]—died  Nov. 4, 1954, Yogyakarta, Indon.) Indonesian nationalist and religious leader from an upper class Minangkabau family, who played a key role during the 1920s in moderating the messianic and communist element in the Muslim nationalist movement in the Dutch East Indies.
Agus Salim received a Dutch education through secondary school, after which he dealt with Dutch consular affairs in Jiddah, Arabia, where he became interested in reformist and modernist movements in Islām. In 1915 Salim joined the Sarekat Islam (Islamic Association) and soon became a leading influence in that Indonesian nationalist group. His opposition to the messianic cult that had grown up around the group’s central figure, Omar Said Tjokroaminoto, led to a de-emphasis of mystical elements in the organization.
