Alicia Alonso, née Alicia Ernestina de la Caridad del Cobre Martínez y del Hoyo  (born December 21, 1921, Havana, Cuba) Cuban ballerina highly regarded for her convincing portrayals of leading roles in the great works of classical and Romantic ballet. She was best known for her lively, precise Giselle and for her sensual, tragic Carmen.
Her dance studies began in childhood with flamenco lessons in Spain. Later she studied ballet in Havana, where she met fellow dancer Fernando Alonso. Soon after he moved to New York City in 1937, she joined him, and the couple subsequently married; they divorced in the mid-1970s. At age 17 she enrolled in the School of American Ballet, though she took a brief break to have a baby in 1938. That year she made her stage debut in the musical comedy Great Lady, and in 1939 she joined George Balanchine’s Ballet Caravan.
