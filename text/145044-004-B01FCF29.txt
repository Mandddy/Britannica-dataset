Opened in 1866, Fisk School was named for General Clinton B. Fisk of the Tennessee Freedmen’s Bureau, who gave the school its original facilities in a former Union army barracks. It became a university the next year. In severe debt by 1871, the school emptied its treasury to finance a fund-raising concert tour by a student group, the Fisk Jubilee Singers. As well as successfully raising funds, the Singers’ concerts in the United States and Europe helped establish spirituals as an art form.
