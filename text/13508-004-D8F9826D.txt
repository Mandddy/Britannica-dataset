Tell el-Amarna, also spelled Tall al-Amarna or Tall al-ʿAmarīnah,  site of the ruins and tombs of the city of Akhetaton (“Horizon of Aton”) in Upper Egypt, 44 miles (71 km) north of modern Asyūt. On a virgin site on the east bank of the Nile River, Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV) built the city about 1348 bce as the new capital of his kingdom when he abandoned the worship of Amon and devoted himself to that of Aton. About four years after Akhenaton’s death (c. 1332), the court returned to Thebes, and the city was abandoned.
Though it had a brief existence, Akhetaton is one of the few ancient Egyptian cities that has been carefully excavated. Because Akhenaton chose a new, unused site for his capital and because of the relatively short duration of its occupancy, the excavators could reconstruct an unusually accurate picture of the layout of the city.
