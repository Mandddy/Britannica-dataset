Jezebel, American drama film, released in 1938, that features Bette Davis opposite Henry Fonda in an opulent antebellum romance.
Davis, in an Academy Award-winning performance, portrayed Julie Marsden, the strong-willed belle whose impertinent spoiled nature wreaks havoc on her relationship with fiancé Preston Dillard (Fonda). The scene in which Marsden decides to spurn the tradition of a maiden’s wearing a white gown to a dress ball, choosing instead to appear in “scandalous” red, seals her reputation as a headstrong flouter of societal mores. By the film’s end, however, she has found an opportunity to redeem herself—in the eyes of both Dillard and the audience.
