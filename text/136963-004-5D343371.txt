Deep Space 1, U.S. satellite designed to test technologies—including an ion engine, autonomous navigation, and miniature cameras and electronics—for use on future space missions.
Deep Space 1 was launched on Oct. 24, 1998, and entered an orbit around the Sun. On November 11 part of its mission, flybys of an asteroid and a comet, was threatened when the ion engine, which used electrical charges to repel its exhaust fluid, shut down unexpectedly only minutes after it was powered up for a test. Engineers soon determined the problem—apparently a common self-contamination effect—and started long-duration burns on November 24. On July 29, 1999, it flew past asteroid Braille. Although the probe was pointed in the wrong direction and did not obtain the high-resolution images scientists wanted, the mission was an overall success.
