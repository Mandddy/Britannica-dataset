The child of a newspaperman-author-lecturer, Arthur Godfrey grew up in New Jersey not far from New York City. At the age of 14 he abandoned high school and ran away from home. After three years of working at nondescript jobs he enlisted in the U.S. Navy, where he was trained to be a radio operator. After serving for four years he enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard in 1927, and with this turn his career as an entertainer began; he became involved with Coast Guard entertainment programs. A Coast Guard program put him in touch with the Baltimore radio station WFBR, and when he was released from the service he found employment there, first as a singer, then announcing, and eventually as station manager.
