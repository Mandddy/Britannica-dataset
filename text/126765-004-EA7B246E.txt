Snake-necked turtle, any of about 16 species of turtles belonging to the genera Chelodina and Macrochelodina in family Chelidae, characterized by long necks that can bend and move in a serpentine fashion. Snake-necked turtles are a group of side-necked turtles with necks that range from nearly as long as to slightly longer than the shell. They inhabit the waterways of Australia and southern New Guinea and possess the longest neck of any group of turtles in the world. The neck is so long that it cannot be retracted completely beneath the margin of the shell.
All snake-necked turtles appear to be strongly aquatic and prefer to walk along the bottom of streams and other water bodies rather than swim. They are carnivores and prey on fish. When hiding from predators or stalking prey, the neck is folded against the body. When prey is close, the neck and head lunge forward, and the animal opens its mouth and throat to create a vacuum. Water and prey are sucked into the mouth, which snaps shut. The mouth may then open slightly to allow water, but not the prey, to escape.
