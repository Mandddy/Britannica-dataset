Christian Fürchtegott Gellert,  (born July 4, 1715, Hainichen, Saxony [now in Germany]—died Dec. 13, 1769, Leipzig) poet and novelist, a prominent representative of the German Enlightenment whose works were, for a time, second in popularity only to the Bible.
The son of a pastor, Gellert was reared in a poor and extremely pious family. After working as a tutor, he studied at the University of Leipzig, where he became a Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer) in 1745 and a professor in 1751. Popular both for his work and for his personality, his lectures on poetry, rhetoric, and ethics were exceptionally well attended.
