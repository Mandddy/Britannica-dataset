Estancia, in the RÃ­o de la Plata region of Argentina and Uruguay, an extensive rural estate largely devoted to cattle ranching and to some extent to the raising of feed grain.
From the late 18th century estancieros (owners of estancias) began to acquire tracts of land in the Pampas (grasslands) of Argentina, which by the late 19th century had been almost entirely fenced in to form these estates. By 1900 about 300 families owned most of the Argentine Pampas, each with an estancia measured in hundreds of thousands of acres. A similar situation obtained in Uruguay.
