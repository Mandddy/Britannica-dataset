Bonito (genus Sarda), tunalike schooling fish of the tuna and mackerel family, Scombridae (order Perciformes). Bonitos are swift, predacious fishes found worldwide. They have striped backs and silvery bellies and grow to a length of about 75 cm (30 inches). Like tunas, they are streamlined, with a narrow tail base, a forked tail, and a row of small finlets behind the dorsal and anal fins. Bonitos are of both commercial and sporting value. Four species are generally recognized: S. sarda of the Atlantic and Mediterranean, S. orientalis of the Indo-Pacific, S. chilensis of the eastern Pacific, and S. australis of Australia and New Zealand.
The species S. chilensis is made up of two distinct geographic populations: the Pacific bonito (S. chilensis lineolata) and the Eastern Pacific bonito (S. chilensis chiliensis). The leaping bonito (Cybiosarda elegans) is a related Indo-Pacific food and sport fish. The oceanic bonito is the skipjack tuna (see tuna).
