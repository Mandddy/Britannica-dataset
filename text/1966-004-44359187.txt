Labrador tea, common name for two species of low-growing, perennial evergreen shrubs in the Rhododendron genus of the heath family (Ericaceae). R. tomentosum is circumpolar and also native to eastern North America. The name is also sometimes applied to a closely related shrub of the Rocky Mountains region. The plants used to be in the now eliminated genus Ledum, which differed from Rhododendron only in having separate, not fused, petals and capsules that open from the bottom first.
R. groenlandicum is found in cold boggy areas and grows to about 1 metre (3 feet) high. The twigs are reddish. The fragrant leaves, which are sometimes used for making tea, are smooth-edged and elliptical and have a rusty “wool” on the underside. The leaf margins are recurved. The white or creamy flowers, 2 cm (0.8 inch) wide, are borne in a terminal cluster. There are five sepals and five petals.
