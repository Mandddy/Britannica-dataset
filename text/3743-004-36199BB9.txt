Rhinoceros beetle (subfamily Dynastinae), also called elephant beetle, Hercules beetle, or Atlas beetle,  any of numerous species of beetles, some of which are among the largest beetles on Earth, named for the impressive hornlike structures on the frontal portions of males. These beetles have rounded, convex backs, and their coloration varies from black to mottled greenish gray. Some are shiny, almost metallic, whereas others may be covered with short, fine hairs, giving them a velveteen appearance.
Some species, such as the Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules), can grow to more than 18 cm (7 inches) long, of which 10 cm (4 inches) may be horn. The Hercules beetle and rhinoceros beetle (D. neptunus) are spectacular, resembling an enormous pair of pincers. Found in American tropical forests, these two species have double horns that are oriented vertically. The upper horn curves forward from behind the head, whereas the lower emerges from the head itself. Another striking specimen is the 13-cm (5-inch) elephant beetle (Megasoma elephas) of the lowland rainforests in Central and South America. The maleâ€™s head sports a long central horn that is split. Shorter, conical horns project forward from each side of the thorax. The American rhinoceros beetle (Xyloryctes jamaicensis) is a dark brown scarab a little more than 25 mm (1 inch) long. The male possesses a single upright horn; the female has only a small tubercle. One European species, Oryctes nasicornis, has rear-pointing horns. The eastern Hercules beetle (D. tityus) is another rhinoceros beetle found in temperate regions. The larvae can damage plant roots, and the 62-mm (2.4-inch) adults live under rotting bark.
