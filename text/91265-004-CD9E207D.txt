Patrick J. Fitzgerald,  (born December 22, 1960, New York City, New York, U.S.) American lawyer who, as the U.S. attorney (Northern District of Illinois) in Chicago (2001–12) and as a special prosecutor, supervised a number of high-profile investigations in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
Fitzgerald was born to Irish immigrant parents in New York City. He paid for his university studies by working as a janitor and—like his father—as a doorman in Manhattan. Fitzgerald studied mathematics and economics at Amherst (Massachusetts) College, graduating in 1982. He earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1985 and worked in private practice until 1988, when he joined the U.S. Department of Justice (Southern District of New York) as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York City. In that job, he pursued cases against drug dealers, Mafia leaders, and terrorists—including the indictment of Osama bin Laden in 1998 for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He also developed a reputation for using obscure or long-forgotten laws to clinch a case; he built his case against Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman (convicted for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing) upon a statute that dated back to the Civil War.
