Ransom Eli Olds,  (born June 3, 1864, Geneva, Ohio, U.S.—died  Aug. 26, 1950, Lansing, Mich.) American inventor and automobile manufacturer, designer of the three-horsepower, curved-dash Oldsmobile, the first commercially successful American-made automobile and the first to use a progressive assembly system, which foreshadowed modern mass-production methods.
In 1899 Olds formed the Olds Motor Works with financial backing from Samuel L. Smith, a wealthy lumberman, in Lansing, Mich. The first Oldsmobiles were marketed in 1901, and sales reached 5,000 in 1904. In 1904, after an argument with Smith over the latter’s plans to substitute a large touring car for the popular Oldsmobile, Olds left the company and formed the Reo Motor Car Company. By 1907 he had built Reo into one of the industry’s leaders, but after 1908 the company steadily lost ground to its competitors. After 1915 Olds turned most of his attention from the automobile business to other activities, including the marketing of a lawn mower he had invented and land speculation in Florida.
