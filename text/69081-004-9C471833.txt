Leo Baekeland, in full Leo Hendrik Baekeland  (born November 14, 1863, Ghent, Belgiumâ€”died February 23, 1944, Beacon, New York, U.S.) U.S. industrial chemist who helped found the modern plastics industry through his invention of Bakelite, the first thermosetting plastic (a plastic that does not soften when heated).
Baekeland received his doctorate maxima cum laude from the University of Ghent at the age of 21 and taught there until 1889, when he went to the U.S. and joined a photographic firm. He soon set up his own company to manufacture his invention, Velox, a photographic paper that could be developed under artificial light. Velox was the first commercially successful photographic paper. In 1899 Baekeland sold his company and rights to the paper to the U.S. inventor George Eastman for $1,000,000.
