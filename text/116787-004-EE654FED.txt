Andrew Wiles, in full Sir Andrew John Wiles  (born April 11, 1953, Cambridge, England) British mathematician who proved  Fermat’s last theorem. In recognition he was awarded a special silver plaque—he was beyond the traditional age limit of 40 years for receiving the gold Fields Medal—by the International Mathematical Union in 1998. He also received the Wolf Prize (1995–96) and the Abel Prize (2016).
Wiles was educated at Merton College, Oxford (B.A., 1974), and Clare College, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1980). Following a junior research fellowship at Cambridge (1977–80), Wiles held an appointment at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in 1982 he moved to Princeton (New Jersey) University, where he became professor emeritus in 2012. Wiles subsequently joined the faculty at Oxford.
