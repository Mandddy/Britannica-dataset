Claw, also called Talon ,  narrow, arched structure that curves downward from the end of a digit in birds, reptiles, many mammals, and some amphibians. It is a hardened (keratinized) modification of the epidermis. Claws may be adapted for scratching, clutching, digging, or climbing. By analogy, the appendages of other lower animals are frequently called claws. The clawâ€™s shape is ordinarily suited to the food-getting habit of the animal. Eagles have long, curved talons for grasping prey; the claws of chickens are short and sturdy, for scratching the ground for food.
There are two mammalian modifications of the claw: the nail and the hoof. A nail is a broad, flat claw on the upper surface of the digit. It is present in mammals, such as primates, that use their appendages for grasping. A hoof is a short, thick structure that surrounds the end of the digit. It is present in various forms in the ungulates, which have a reduced number of digits. Hoofs are an adaptation for running.
