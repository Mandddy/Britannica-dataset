Rosa Ponselle, original name Rosa Melba Ponzillo  (born Jan. 22, 1897, Meriden, Conn., U.S.—died  May 25, 1981, Baltimore, Md.) American coloratura soprano of great breadth of range and expressive ability, who is probably best known for her performance in the title role of Vincenzo Bellini’s Norma.
Ponzillo began singing at an early age in the cafés and motion-picture theatres of Meriden, Connecticut, and nearby New Haven. Later she and her sister Carmela played in vaudeville in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as the Ponzillo Sisters. Much of her early career is obscure, but in 1918 she came to the attention of Enrico Caruso, who was deeply impressed by her voice. At his urging she was engaged by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, and in November 1918, as Rosa Ponselle, she made her operatic debut opposite Caruso, taking on the challenging role of Leonora in Giuseppe Verdi’s La forza del destino. She studied for the role with Romano Romani, who remained her principal vocal coach and teacher for the rest of her career.
