George Burns, original name Nathan Birnbaum  (born January 20, 1896, New York, New York, U.S.—died March 9, 1996, Beverly Hills, California) American comedian who—with his dry humour, gravelly voice, and ever-present cigar—was popular for more than 70 years in vaudeville, radio, film, and television. He was especially known as part of a comedy team with his wife, Gracie Allen.
Burns began his career at age seven as a singer in the PeeWee Quartet and later performed as a dancer, skater, and comic. He met Allen in the early 1920s, and they married in 1926. Beginning in 1933, Burns and Allen headlined their own show on American radio for 17 years, playing fictional versions of their real-life selves. They also achieved success in movies during the 1930s in such films as The Big Broadcast (1932), International House (1933), Six of a Kind (1934), Love in Bloom (1935), and College Swing (1938). A Damsel in Distress (1937) provided the team with their best screen roles; the film is particularly memorable for two intricate dance routines performed by Burns, Allen, and Fred Astaire.
