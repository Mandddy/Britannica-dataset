Frank Costello, original name Francesco Castiglia   (born Jan. 26, 1891, Cosenza, Italy—died  Feb. 18, 1973, New York, N.Y., U.S.) major American syndicate gangster, a close associate of Lucky Luciano, noted for his influence with politicians.
Arriving in New York City at the age of four with his immigrant Calabrian parents, Costello grew up in East Harlem and became head of the 104th Street Gang, a group of young Italian hoodlums. In 1915 he went to prison for a year for carrying a concealed weapon; on release he allied himself with Lucky Luciano and, in the course of the 1920s, branched into bootlegging and gambling operations in New York, Florida, Louisiana, and other states. In 1931, after the death of crime bosses Giuseppe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano, Costello became the syndicate’s political link and Luciano’s closest aide, quietly taking over his syndicate interests when the boss of bosses was deported to Italy in 1946. He also gathered interests in Las Vegas gambling casinos and socialized with New York politicians and businessmen.
