Sir Horace Curzon Plunkett,  (born Dec. 24, 1854, Sherborne, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died March 26, 1932, Weybridge, Surrey) pioneer of Irish agricultural cooperation who strongly influenced the rise of the agricultural cooperative movement in Great Britain and the Commonwealth.
Plunkett, whose father was a baron in the Irish peerage and whose family seat was at Dunsany, County Meath, was educated in England. He went to the United States in 1879 and spent 10 years as a cattle rancher in Wyoming. He returned to Ireland in 1889 and devoted himself to the agricultural cooperative movement, first organizing creameries and then, in 1894, the Irish Agricultural Organization Society, a forerunner of similar societies in England, Wales, and Scotland. A moderate Unionist member of Parliament for South County Dublin from 1892 to 1900, he became vice president (1899–1907) of the new Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, which he had been instrumental in creating.
