Trebbia River, Italian Fiume Trebbia, Latin Trebia ,  river, Emilia-Romagna region, northern Italy, rising in the Ligurian Apennines at an elevation of 4,613 feet (1,406 metres) northeast of Genoa and flowing 71 miles (115 km) north-northeast across the northern Apennines and the Po lowland to enter the Po River just west of Piacenza (ancient Placentia). Throughout its course, except for the first 2 miles (3.2 km), the river is followed by the Genoa-Piacenza Highway.
The river is known in Roman history for the victory gained on its bank in 218 bce by Hannibal, whose troops defeated the combined armies of the consuls Publius Cornelius Scipio (the father of Scipio Africanus the Elder) and Tiberius Sempronius Longus; some of the Roman troops, mainly cavalry, escaped to nearby Placentia, but most of them were driven into the river to their death. The plain of the Trebbia was also the scene in 1799 of a defeat of the French under Jacques-Ã‰tienne Macdonald (later duke of Tarente) by a Russo-Austrian army commanded by Gen. A.V. Suvorov.
