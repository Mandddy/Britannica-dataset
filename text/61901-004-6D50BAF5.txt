Mary Adelaide Nutting,  (born Nov. 1, 1858, Frost Village, District of East Canada [now Quebec, Can.]—died Oct. 3, 1948, White Plains, N.Y., U.S.)  American nurse and educator, remembered for her influential role in raising the quality of higher education in nursing, hospital administration, and related fields.
Nutting grew up in Waterloo, Ontario. In 1889 she entered the first class of the new Johns Hopkins Hospital School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland. After graduating in 1891 she was a head nurse in the hospital for two years and then assistant superintendent of nurses for a year. In 1894 she became superintendent of nurses and principal of the school. At that time nursing schools, even that at Johns Hopkins, were more important as sources of cheap staffing for hospitals—at a rate of from 60 to 105 hours a week from each student—than as centres of professional training. Nutting moved quickly to change the priorities in her school.
