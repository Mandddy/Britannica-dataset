Celosia, genus of about 45 species of herbaceous plants in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), native to tropical America and Africa. A number of species, including the cockscomb (Celosia cristata), are cultivated as garden ornamentals and are sometimes called woolflowers for their dense chaffy flower spikes that somewhat glisten. Lagos spinach, or silver cockscomb (C. argentea), is an important food crop in West Africa, where it is grown for its nutritious leafy greens.
Members of the genus are characterized by alternate simple or lobed leaves and small showy flowers in dense spikes. The inflorescences of cultivated forms are often flattened or undulating and form compact or feathery clusters. Many produce copious amounts of seeds and can readily reseed themselves in suitable growing conditions.
