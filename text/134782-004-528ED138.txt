Saint Calixtus I, also spelled Callistus  (died 222, Rome [Italy]; feast day October 14) pope from 217? to 222, during the schism of St. Hippolytus, the churchâ€™s first antipope. Little was known about Calixtus before the discovery of Philosophumena by Hippolytus, a work that is, in part, a pamphlet directed against him.
Calixtus was originally a slave. He was denounced as a Christian by the Jews, who had him sentenced to the Sardinian mines. On his return he was pensioned by Pope St. Victor I. Later he was ordained deacon by Pope St. Zephyrinus and probably became his chief counselor.
