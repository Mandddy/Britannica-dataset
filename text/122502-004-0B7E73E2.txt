Oran, also called Wahrān, French Ouahran,  city, northwestern Algeria. It lies along an open bay on the Mediterranean Sea coast, about midway between Tangier, Morocco, and Algiers, at the point where Algeria is closest to Spain. With the adjacent city of Mers el-Kebir, a fishing centre at the western end of the bay, Oran is the country’s second largest port, after Algiers. Pop. (2005) 724,000; (2010 est.) 770,000.
Oran was founded at the beginning of the 10th century by Andalusian merchants as a base for trade with the North African hinterland, and it developed commercially owing to its sea connections with Europe. It became the port for the North African kingdom of Tlemcen in 1437 and also was an entrepôt for trade with the Sudan. In 1492 and 1502 Oran received colonies of Spanish Muslims (Moors) fleeing from forcible conversion to Christianity. Thereafter, its prosperity began to decline, and, with Mers el-Kebir, it became a centre for pirates. It was occupied by the Spanish in 1509. For the next two centuries, Oran was contested by the various Mediterranean powers until it fell to the Turks in 1708. The constant raids of pirates based at Mers el-Kebir prompted Spain to retake Oran in 1732. Devastated by an earthquake in 1790, the town was evacuated and returned (in 1792) to the Turks, who settled a Jewish community there. Oran was occupied in 1831 by the French, who developed it as a modern port and turned Mers el-Kebir into a major naval base.
