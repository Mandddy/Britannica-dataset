Bodybuilding, a regimen of exercises designed to enhance the human body’s muscular development and promote general health and fitness. As a competitive activity, bodybuilding aims to display in artistic fashion pronounced muscle mass, symmetry, and definition for overall aesthetic effect. Barbells, dumbbells, and other resistance training devices are used in the exercises. For the use of similar exercises for sports training and conditioning, general conditioning, and rehabilitation therapy, see weight training.
Bodybuilding by the ancient Greeks served as the origin and inspiration for its practice by most later societies. Modern competitions grew largely out of European strongman theatrical and circus acts of the late 19th century. The first American physique contest, staged by physical culturist Bernarr Macfadden (1868–1955), took place in 1903 in New York City. The winner, Al Treloar, was named “The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World.” Similar contests were held by Macfadden in 1921 and 1922, with Charles Atlas the winner both times. But bodybuilding contests were rare until the inception of the Mr. America contest in 1939 under the auspices of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) of the United States. Thereafter, Mr. America winners John Grimek (1940–41) and Steve Reeves (1947) served as role models for a generation of aspiring bodybuilders. The sport developed quickly after World War II, and the AAU Mr. America contest reached the height of its popularity in the late 1950s and the 1960s. Concurrently there emerged two rival organizations, the International Federation of BodyBuilders, founded by Canadians Joe and Ben Weider in 1946, and in Britain the National Amateur Body-Builders’ Association, founded by Oscar Heidenstam in 1950. The latter’s Mr. Universe contest, staged in London, was the most prestigious international bodybuilding event for about 25 years. It was surpassed in the 1970s by the Mr. Olympia competition conducted by the Weiders.
