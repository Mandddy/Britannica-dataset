Guadalquivir River, Spanish Río Guadalquivir, Arabic Wadi Al-Kabīr (“Great River”),  major watercourse of southern Spain. Rising in the mountains of Jaén province, it flows in a generally westward direction for 408 miles (657 km), emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at Sanlúcar de Barrameda, on the Gulf of Cádiz. It drains an area of 22,318 square miles (57,803 square km).
The Guadalquivir is among the longest rivers in Spain (along with the Ebro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana), and it has several distinctive characteristics. Its natural environment is one of the richest and most varied areas of plant and animal life in Europe. Its irrigative capacity, particularly in its wide and fertile plain, supports the rich agriculture of Andalusia, and engineering improvements have aided the industrialization of towns along its course.
