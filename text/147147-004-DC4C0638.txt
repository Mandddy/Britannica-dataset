Tenrikyō,  (Japanese: “Religion of Divine Wisdom”), largest and most successful of the modern Shintō sects in Japan. Though founded in the 19th century, it is often considered in connection with the evangelistic “new religions” of contemporary Japan.
Tenrikyō originated with Nakayama Miki (1798–1887), a charismatic peasant from Yamato Province (modern Nara Prefecture), who claimed she became possessed by a god called Tenri Ō no Mikoto (“Lord of Divine Wisdom”) when she was 40 years old. She developed a worship characterized by ecstatic dancing and shamanistic practices, and a simple doctrine (based on the oracles transmitted through her) emphasizing charity and the healing of disease through mental acts of faith. The sect became popular in her lifetime, though it often met with persecution from state authorities. Her writings and her deeds were considered divine models, and she was widely venerated during her lifetime and since. The founder, Nakayama, was succeeded by Master Iburi (d. 1907); since his death, the leader of the sect has always been a member of the Nakayama family.
