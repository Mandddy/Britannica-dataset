Uriah Smith Stephens,  (born August 3, 1821, Cape May, New Jersey, U.S.â€”died February 13, 1882, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) American utopian reformer who was instrumental in founding the Knights of Labor, the first national labour union in the United States.
Stephens wanted to become a Baptist minister, but family financial reverses (largely brought about by the Panic of 1837) led him into an apprenticeship to a tailor. After working as a tailor in Philadelphia from 1845 to 1853, Stephens traveled to California by way of the West Indies, Central America, and Mexico. When he returned to Philadelphia in 1858 he became caught up in antebellum reform movements, advocating abolitionism and a utopian socialism that would later underlie his union-organizing efforts.
