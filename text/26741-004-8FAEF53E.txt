Paul Taylor, in full Paul Belville Taylor  (born July 29, 1930, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American modern dancer and choreographer noted for the inventive, frequently humorous, and sardonic dances that he choreographed for his company.
Entering Syracuse University in 1947 on swimming and painting scholarships, Taylor began dance training in 1951. He subsequently studied modern dance with Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and José Limón and ballet with Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske. He began his professional career in 1953 with Martha Graham’s company, creating such important roles as Aegisthus in Clytemnestra (1958), Hercules in Alcestis (1960), and Theseus in Phaedra (1962). He also performed in works by other modern choreographers, including those of Charles Weidman and Merce Cunningham. He danced a solo created for him by George Balanchine in Episodes (1959), a work choreographed by Balanchine and Graham to music by Anton Webern.
