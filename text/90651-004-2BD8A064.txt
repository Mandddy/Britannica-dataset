Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, American dramatic film, released in 1939, by director Frank Capra that angered the political establishment but won wide acclaim from the public and film industry.
The story concerns Jefferson Smith (played by James Stewart), a hokey, idealistic youth leader who is appointed to the U.S. Senate by his state’s political authorities on the assumption that he will be a pliable stooge. However, when he proposes a national youth camp on the site of a crooked land deal he was expected to approve, his benefactors—as well as the state’s senior senator (Claude Rains)—turn against him. Disillusioned by the corruption of Washington, Smith nearly leaves town but is persuaded by his secretary (Jean Arthur) to mount an impassioned challenge to the system in the form of a marathon filibuster. In the popular climactic scene, one of the few in film history that hinges on a legislative tactic, Smith successfully exposes the attempted graft and wins the day.
