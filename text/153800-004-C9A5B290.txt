High-school level instruction began in 1898, and the school became Seattle College the same year. Bachelor of arts degrees were first awarded in 1909. Because of World War I, instruction was suspended from 1918 until 1922. Women first matriculated in 1933 and first graduated in 1936. The school was elevated to university status in 1948. A professional degree program in education was established in the mid 1930s, and a doctorate program in education was added in 1976. Seattle University is a pioneer in creating academic programs, including an addiction studies program (1973), a graduate program in software engineering (1987), an undergraduate program in environmental engineering (1990), and an executive master’s degree program in not-for-profit leadership (1995).
