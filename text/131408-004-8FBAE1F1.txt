Portishead, British trip-hop group who popularized the genre in North America by fusing dance music conventions such as drum loops and samples with atmospheric, cabaret-style vocals. Principal members included lead singer Beth Gibbons (b. Jan. 4, 1965, Keynsham, Bath and North East Somerset, Eng.), producer Geoff Barrow (b. Dec. 9, 1971, Walton-in-Gordano, North Somerset, Eng.), and guitarist Adrian Utley (b. April 27, 1957, Northampton, Northamptonshire, Eng.).
Barrow, who was active in the Bristol music scene in the early 1990s, got his start in the recording industry writing songs for Neneh Cherry and doing production work for trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. Gibbons had been earning a living as a nightclub singer when she and Barrow met in 1991 while participating in a job-training program at the Bristol unemployment office. They collaborated on a number of songs and dubbed themselves Portishead, after the town where Barrow grew up. Meanwhile, Barrow continued working as a producer and remixed songs for a diverse collection of groups that included Primal Scream, Ride, and Depeche Mode. During this time, Portisheadâ€™s core lineup was completed with the additon of Utley, a veteran jazz guitarist who had previously recorded with guitar viruoso Jeff Beck.
