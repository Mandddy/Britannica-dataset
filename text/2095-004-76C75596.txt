John Lewis, in full John Aaron Lewis  (born May 3, 1920, La Grange, Illinois, U.S.—died March 29, 2001, New York, New York) American jazz pianist and composer-arranger who was an influential member of the Modern Jazz Quartet, one of the longest-lived and best-received groups in jazz history.
Reared in New Mexico by academically oriented parents, Lewis studied piano from childhood and, until 1942, anthropology and music at the University of New Mexico. He served in the U.S. Army (1942–45) and subsequently worked as a pianist with Dizzy Gillespie, arranging “Two Bass Hit,” “Emanon,” “Minor Walk,” and his own “Toccata for Trumpet and Orchestra” for Gillespie’s big band. His restrained piano style, which was influenced by classical music, made him a highly sought-after sideman, and he worked with Miles Davis (having arranged “Move,” “Budo,” and “Rouge” for Davis’s album Birth of the Cool), Charlie Parker, Lester Young, and Illinois Jacquet.
