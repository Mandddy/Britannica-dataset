Janet Flanner, pseudonym Genêt  (born March 13, 1892, Indianapolis, Ind., U.S.—died  Nov. 7, 1978, New York, N.Y.) American writer who was the Paris correspondent for The New Yorker magazine for nearly half a century.
Flanner was the child of Quakers. She attended the University of Chicago in 1912–14 and then returned to Indianapolis and took a job with the Indianapolis Star, becoming the paper’s first movie critic in 1916. She married but later divorced, and throughout the rest of her life her most passionate relationships were with women. After a sojourn in New York City, she traveled throughout Europe, eventually settling in Paris in 1922. She lived there until 1975 (except for the war years 1939–44). She was hired by Harold Ross in 1925 to write a periodic “Letter from Paris” for his new magazine, The New Yorker. Signed Genêt, the articles contained observations on politics, art, theatre, French culture, and various personalities.
