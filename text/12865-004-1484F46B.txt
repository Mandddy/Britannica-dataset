Civilian Conservation Corps  (CCC), (1933â€“42), one of the earliest New Deal programs, established to relieve unemployment during the Great Depression by providing national conservation work primarily for young unmarried men. Projects included planting trees, building flood barriers, fighting forest fires, and maintaining forest roads and trails.
Recruits lived in work camps under a semimilitary regime; monthly cash allowances of $30 were supplemented by provision of food, medical care, and other necessities. The CCC, which at its largest employed 500,000 men, provided work for a total of 3,000,000 during its existence.
