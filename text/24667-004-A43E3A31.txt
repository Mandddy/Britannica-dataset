William Pitt Fessenden,  (born Oct. 16, 1806, Boscawen, N.H., U.S.—died  Sept. 8, 1869, Portland, Maine) American Whig politician who was influential in founding the Republican Party in 1854.
Fessenden graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1823 and began studying law. He was admitted to the bar in 1827 and served the Portland area (as a Whig) in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1841 to 1843. Disliking congressional life, he left the capital in 1843, determined never to return. The intensifying conflict over slavery, however, eventually caused him to abandon his earlier resolve, and in 1854 Fessenden moved back to Washington, representing Maine in the Senate, a position he held until his death (save for a few months as a member of Lincoln’s cabinet). Fessenden was part of a small group of Northern senators who opposed the extension of slavery into the territories, and he was one of the leaders of the movement that resulted in the formation of the Republican Party. During the Civil War (1861–65), he was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. On the resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase in 1864, Fessenden was appointed to the Treasury post, where he served for eight months.
