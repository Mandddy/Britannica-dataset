Ocean liner, one of the two principal types of merchant ship as classified by operating method; the other is the tramp steamer. A liner operates on a regular schedule of designated ports, carrying whatever cargo and passengers are available on the date of sailing. The first liners were operated in the North Atlantic, notably by Samuel Cunard of Britain, beginning in 1840. Cunard liners continued to be leaders, though soon joined by French, German, U.S., and other ships, subsidized by their national governments and competing in size, speed, and passenger accommodations. The heyday of the ocean liner lasted from the late 19th to the mid-20th century. Among the most famous were the “Mauretania,” sister ship of the ill-fated “Lusitania” and for 23 years holder of the blue ribbon for transatlantic speed; the “Aquitania,” also a Cunarder, the last four-funnelled vessel; the German “Vaterland,” seized in New York in 1917 and renamed “Leviathan,” for many years the largest ship afloat; the 80,000-ton “Queen Mary” and “Queen Elizabeth,” giant Cunarders of the 1940s and 1950s; the French Line’s “Normandie,” which set a new transatlantic speed record of just over four days but which was destroyed by a fire in New York harbour in 1942; and the “United States,” which set a new transatlantic record of three days, ten hours, averaging 35 knots, or 41 land miles per hour, in 1952.
The reign of the transatlantic liners as glamour ships of the world was gradually ended by the rise of air travel. A vast fleet of liners, ranging from passenger-cruise vessels to refrigerated cargo ships, continued to cover the world.
