Sammy Baugh, in full Samuel Adrian Baugh, byname Slingin’ Sammy  (born March 17, 1914, Temple, Texas, U.S.—died Dec. 17, 2008, Rotan, Texas) first outstanding quarterback in the history of American professional gridiron football. He played a major role in the emergence of the forward pass as a primary offensive tactic in the 1930s and ’40s. He led the National Football League (NFL) in passing in 6 of his 16 seasons (1937–52) with the Washington Redskins. He also excelled as a punter and as a defensive back. In 1943 he led the NFL in passing, punting, and interceptions (as a defensive back).
At Texas Christian University, in Fort Worth, Baugh became the top passer in the Southwest Conference, a league noted for its wide-open offenses at a time when most football teams used the forward pass only sparingly. He led his team to a victory in the 1936 Sugar Bowl, helping to bring national attention to the conference and to football in the Southwest for the first time. Baugh was named a consensus All-American in his senior season.
