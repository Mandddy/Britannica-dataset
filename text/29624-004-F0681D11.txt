Frédéric Bastiat, in full Claude-Frédéric Bastiat  (born June 29, 1801, Mugron, near Bayonne, France—died December 24, 1850, Rome, Papal States [Italy])  French economist, best known for his journalistic writing in favour of free trade and the economics of Adam Smith.
In 1846 he founded the Associations for Free Trade and used its journal, Le Libre-Échange (“Free Trade”), to advance his antiprotectionist views. In a well-known satiric parable that appeared in his Sophismes économiques (1845; Sophisms of Protection), Bastiat concocted a petition brought by candlemakers who asked for protection against the Sun, suggesting that candlemaking and related industries would greatly profit if the Sun were eliminated as a competitor in furnishing light.
