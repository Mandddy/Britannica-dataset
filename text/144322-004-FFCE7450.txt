Piave River, Italian Fiume Piave,  river in northeastern Italy. It rises on the slopes of Mount Peralba in the Carnic Alps near the Austrian frontier and flows southward to the Belluno basin and its gorge at Feltre, where it turns southeast to meander across the Venetian plain, reaching the Adriatic Sea at Cortellazzo, northeast of Venice. The river is 137 miles (220 km) long and has a drainage basin of 1,580 square miles (4,092 square km). The variations in its flow are extreme; during late summer most of the Piave’s lower course is a bed of dry gravel. Until about 1500 the mouth of the Piave was farther south, near Treporti on the lagoon of Venice. After several changes, the river mouth settled near Caorle until a disastrous flood in 1683, when it shifted to its present outlet. In 1966, swollen by rains, the river burst its dikes in a major flood. The Piave’s upper valley has major hydroelectric stations at Pieve di Cadore and Fadalto, while downstream its waters are used extensively for irrigation. In World War I the Piave River became the main line of Italian defense after the Austrian breakthrough at Caporetto in 1917. Despite concerted Austrian attacks in 1918, the line held, and the Austrians were decisively defeated at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto at the end of October 1918.
