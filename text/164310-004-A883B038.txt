Tony Martin, original name Alvin Morris, also known as Anthony Martin  (born December 25, 1913, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died July 27, 2012, Los Angeles, California) American pop singer and movie actor whose handsome visage and smooth baritone voice made him one of the most celebrated all-around entertainers of his era.
Morris grew up in Oakland, California, and, as a child, sang regularly at his mother’s sewing club. He later took up the clarinet and the saxophone, and while in high school he formed a band called Al Morris and His Four Red Peppers. After dropping out of St. Mary’s College in Moraga, California, in 1932—his parents had wanted him to be a lawyer—Morris played reed instruments for dance bands around the Bay Area, including one led by Tom Gerun that also featured Woody Herman. With Gerun’s band Morris occasionally contributed vocals as well, and, while singing on a radio broadcast, he caught the attention of Hollywood studio mogul Louis B. Mayer. Although a screen test for MGM proved to be fruitless, he landed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures soon thereafter. About this time he also changed his name to Tony Martin. By 1936 Martin had moved to Twentieth Century-Fox, and that year he sang in such movies as Poor Little Rich Girl, starring Shirley Temple, and the musical Sing, Baby, Sing. The following year he married the latter film’s female lead, Alice Faye, although the two divorced in 1940.
