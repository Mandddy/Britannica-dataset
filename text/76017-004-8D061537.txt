Larry Adler, byname of Lawrence Cecil Adler  (born Feb. 10, 1914, Baltimore, Md., U.S.—died Aug. 7, 2001, London, Eng.) American harmonica player generally considered to be responsible for the elevation of the mouth organ to concert status in the world of classical music.
Adler’s family was not particularly musical, but their observance of Orthodox Judaism provided access to religious music. By age 10 Adler was the youngest cantor in Baltimore, although unhappy in school. By feigning a nervous breakdown, he convinced his parents to let him enroll in the Peabody Conservatory of Music, but he was soon dismissed as untalented. The rebuff made him even more determined. At age 11, without his parents’ consent, Adler ordered a piano for their home, which he then persuaded them to accept. He also began playing the mouth organ. Unable to read music, he listened assiduously, buying records and concert tickets with money earned by selling magazines.
