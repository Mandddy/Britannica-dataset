Antitank weapon, any of several guns, missiles, and mines intended for use against tanks. The first response to the introduction of tanks during World War I was a variety of grenades and large-calibre rifles designed to penetrate tanks’ relatively thin armour or disable their tracks. Land mines and ordinary artillery were also used effectively. By the beginning of World War II, a family of small, low-trajectory artillery pieces had been developed as antitank guns. These were initially of 37-millimetre (1.46-inch) calibre and fired special ammunition. During the war increasingly larger calibres were used, and a variety of ammunition types—including shells tipped with harder alloys, improved propellants to give higher velocities, and more powerful explosives—were developed. The German 88-millimetre (3.46-inch) antitank gun was a particularly effective weapon in the war. A number of antitank guns used the shaped or hollow charge shell, which was designed to explode on impact and channel the explosive energy forward, enhancing penetrating force. Recoilless rifles were also specially developed for use against tanks.
World War II also saw the production of a variety of antitank missiles and launching devices, of which the American bazooka and its counterparts in other armies were the best known; these were small, short-range rocket launchers carried and aimed by a single operator. After World War II the technology of antitank weaponry advanced in several directions. Most important was a new family of electronically guided missiles, employing either beam- or wire-guidance systems. By the early 1970s these had attained a high degree of refinement in accuracy, range, and versatility. Antitank guns also developed rapidly in this period, with further improvements in propellants, explosives, projectiles, and the design of gun tubes. Some antitank guns were smooth-bored instead of rifled in order to fire both missiles and projectiles.
