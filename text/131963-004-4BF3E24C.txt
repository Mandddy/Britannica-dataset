Ted Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1956. He then studied at the International Law School (The Hague) and received a law degree from the University of Virginia (1959). He campaigned for his brother John in the 1960 presidential race and in 1962 was elected to the president’s former U.S. Senate seat representing Massachusetts.
