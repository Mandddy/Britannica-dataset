Pierre de Brantôme, in full Pierre de Bourdeille, Abbé Et Seigneur (lord) de Brantôme  (born c. 1540, Périgord, Fr.—died July 15, 1614, France) soldier and chronicler, author of a valuable and informative account of his own life and times.
His works, characterized by frankness and naïveté, consist mainly of accounts of battles or tales of chivalry. Though he is not generally considered a reliable historian, his bold, capricious character well equipped him to be a chronicler of the 16th century.
