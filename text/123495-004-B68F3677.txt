Jimmu, in full Jimmu Tennō, original name Kow-yamato-iware-hiko No Mikoto,  legendary first emperor of Japan and founder of the imperial dynasty.
Japanese chronicles record Jimmu’s expedition eastward from Hyuga in 607 bc along Japan’s Inland Sea, subduing tribes as he went and ending in Yamato, where he established his centre of power. Although modern historians do not accept such details as a 7th century bc date, preferring a date in the Early Christian era, they affirm the tradition of an aggressive movement of peoples from the west.
