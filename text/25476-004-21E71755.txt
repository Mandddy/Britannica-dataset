Andrea Orcagna, original name Andrea di Cione   (born c. 1308—died c. 1368) the most prominent Florentine painter, sculptor, and architect of the mid-14th century.
The son of a goldsmith, Orcagna was the leading member of a family of painters, which included three younger brothers: Nardo (died 1365/66), Matteo, and Jacopo (died after 1398) di Cione. He matriculated in the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali in 1343–44 and was admitted to the guild of stonemasons in 1352. In 1354 he contracted to paint an altarpiece for the Strozzi Chapel in the left transept of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence. This polyptych (signed and dated 1357) shows that the forceful handling of the figures is strongly individual, as is the attempt to treat the panels of the polyptych as a unitary scheme. The surviving section of a fresco of the Triumph of Death in Santa Croce has also been ascribed to Orcagna. In September 1367 he received the commission from the Arte del Cambio for an altarpiece of the patron of the guild, St. Matthew, with four scenes from his life. In August 1368 the execution of this picture (now in the Uffizi, Florence) was taken over by Jacopo di Cione on account of the illness of his brother. Orcagna is assumed to have died in this year.
