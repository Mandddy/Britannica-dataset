Isabelle-Agnès-Élizabeth de Charrière, original name Isabella Agneta Elisabeth van Tuyll van Serooskerken, bynames Belle van Zuylen, Zélide, and Abbé de la Tour  (born Oct. 20, 1740, Zuilen, near Utrecht, Neth.—died  Dec. 27, 1805, Colombier, Switz.) Swiss novelist whose work anticipated early 19th-century emancipated ideas.
She married her brother’s Swiss tutor and settled at Colombier near Neuchâtel. Influenced by Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, she expressed views critical of aristocratic privilege, moral conventions (Trois Femmes, 1797; “Three Women”), religious orthodoxy, and poverty, though she was opposed to revolutionary radicalism (Lettres trouvées sous la neige, 1794; “Letters Found on the Snow”). Her novels, of which the most important are Caliste, ou lettres écrites de Lausanne (1786; “Caliste, or Letters Written from Lausanne”) and Lettres neuchâteloises (1784; “Letters of Neuchâtel”), abound in philosophical reflection, refined psychological observation, and local colour but lack coherent plots.
