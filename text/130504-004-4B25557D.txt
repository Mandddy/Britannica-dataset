Attack aircraft, also called Ground Attack Aircraft, or Close Support Aircraft,  type of military aircraft that supports ground troops by making strafing and low-level bombing attacks on enemy ground forces, tanks and other armoured vehicles, and installations. Attack aircraft are typically slower and less maneuverable than air-combat fighters but carry a large and varied load of weapons (automatic cannons, machine guns, rockets, guided missiles, and bombs) and have the ability to fly close to the ground.
During World War I, Germany and Britain strafed each other’s trenches from low-flying biplanes, but true attack aircraft did not emerge until early in World War II, when they acquired an important new mission, that of destroying tanks and other armoured vehicles. These new armoured monoplanes could endure heavy antiaircraft fire while attacking tanks and troop columns at very close range. The most important types were the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2 Stormovik and the U.S. Douglas A-20 Havoc, which were armed with 20-millimetre cannons and .30- or .50-inch machine guns. Two other American attack aircraft of the 1940s and ’50s were the Douglas B-26 Invader and the Douglas A-1 Skyraider. All of these types were piston-engined, propeller-driven aircraft.
