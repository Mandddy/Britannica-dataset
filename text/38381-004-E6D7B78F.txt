Alfred Rosenberg,  (born Jan. 12, 1893, Reval, Estonia—died  Oct. 16, 1946, Nürnberg) German ideologist of Nazism.
Born the son of a cobbler in what was at the time a part of Russia, Rosenberg studied architecture in Moscow until the Revolution of 1917. In 1919 he went to Munich, where he joined Adolf Hitler, Ernst Röhm, and Rudolf Hess in the nascent Nazi Party. As editor of the party newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, he drew on the ideas of the English racist Houston Stewart Chamberlain and on the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, a 19th-century fabrication concerning a supposed Jewish plot for world domination. When Hitler was imprisoned after the Munich Beer Hall Putsch (November 1923), he made Rosenberg leader of the party, knowing him to be incompetent as an organizer and thus unlikely to establish a position of power.
