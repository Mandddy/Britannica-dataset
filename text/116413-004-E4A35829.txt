Christian Longomontanus, byname of Christian Severin   (born Oct. 4, 1562, Longberg, Den.—died  Oct. 8, 1647, Copenhagen) Danish astronomer and astrologer who is best known for his association with and published support of Tycho Brahe. In 1600, when Johannes Kepler went to Prague to work with Tycho, he found Tycho and Longomontanus engaged in extensive observations and studies of Mars. This turned out to be fortuitous, for, as Kepler later wrote, “Had Christian been treating a different planet, I would have started on it as well.” It was these observations of Mars that eventually enabled Kepler to discover the true laws of planetary motion. Longomontanus later used Tycho’s data to compile the Astronomia danica (1622), an exposition of the Tychonic system, which holds that the Sun revolves around Earth and the other planets revolve around the Sun. He began the construction of the Copenhagen Observatory in 1632 but died before its completion.
