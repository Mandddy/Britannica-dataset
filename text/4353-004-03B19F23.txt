Spillway,  passage for surplus water over or around a dam when the reservoir itself is full. Spillways are particularly important safety features for earth dams, protecting the dam and its foundation from erosion. They may lead over the dam or a portion of it or along a channel around the dam or a conduit through it.
The erosive energy of the water at the foot of the spillway is dissipated by a stilling basin or by a sloping apron tempering the fall and ending in a curved bucket that directs the flow away from the foundation.
