U.S. Open, formally the United States Open Tennis Championships,  international tennis tournament, the fourth and final of the major events that make up the annual Grand Slam of tennis (the other tournaments are the Australian Open, the French Open, and the Wimbledon Championships).
The U.S. Open is held each year over a two-week period in late August and early September. Since 1978 all the U.S. Open championships have been played on the acrylic hard courts of the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) National Tennis Center (renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in 2006) in Flushing Meadows, Queens, N.Y. The U.S. Open consists of championships in five main categories: men’s singles and doubles, women’s singles and doubles, and mixed doubles. The tournament is unique among the Grand Slam events in that tiebreakers are played in the deciding sets (the fifth set for men and the third set for women), instead of continuing play in the final set until a player has won by two games.
