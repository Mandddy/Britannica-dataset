Catalan literature, the body of literature written in the Catalan language, a Romance language spoken primarily in the Spanish autonomous regions of Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands.
Catalan literature has its roots in the Occitan language and the poetic forms cultivated by the troubadours, who dominated the courts of southern France, northern Spain, and northern Italy from the 11th through the 13th century. The early Catalan troubadours Guillem de Bergadà, Hug de Mataplana, and Guillem de Cervera were genuine Provençal poets. In the 14th century the influence of the troubadours began to lessen, and Catalan poets turned to northern France for inspiration. They took over the long French narratives based on romance themes, such as the Arthurian cycle, and wrote in octosyllabic rhymed couplets (called noves rimades [“rhymed news”]).
