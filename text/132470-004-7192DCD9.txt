Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau,  (born Jan. 4, 1737, Dijon, Franceâ€”died Jan. 2, 1816, Paris) French chemist who played a major part in the reform of chemical nomenclature.
The son of a lawyer, Guyton added the title de Morveau (from a family property) to his name after he became a lawyer and a public prosecutor in 1762. During the French Revolution of 1789, however, he prudently dropped the title, and, unlike his colleague chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, he survived.
