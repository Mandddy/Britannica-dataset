LL Cool J, original name James Todd Smith  (born January 14, 1968, Bay Shore, Long Island, New York, U.S.) American rapper and actor, a leading exponent of mid-1980s new-school rap and one of the few hip-hop stars of his era to sustain a successful recording career for more than a decade.
Taking the stage name LL Cool J (“Ladies Love Cool James”) at age 16, Smith signed with fledgling rap label Def Jam in 1984. Distinguished by hard, fast, sinuous rhymes and artfully arrogant phrasing, his first single, “I Need a Beat,” sold more than 100,000 copies. His first album, Radio, was released in 1985, the year he appeared in Krush Groove, the movie celebrating Def Jam’s origins. Thereafter he outlasted most of his competition by constantly creating daring, fresh modes of expression—gaining airplay with rap’s first romantic ballad, “I Need Love” (1987), and prefiguring West Coast rap with “Goin’ Back to Cali” (1988), recorded in California. Criticized by some for his crossover success, LL responded by teaming with producer Marley Marl for the musically and thematically innovative album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990).
