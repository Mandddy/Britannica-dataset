Eugène de Beauharnais,  (born Sept. 3, 1781, Paris, France—died  Feb. 21, 1824, Munich, Bavaria [now in Germany]) soldier, prince of the French First Empire, and viceroy of Italy for Napoleon I, who was his stepfather (from 1796) and adoptive father (from 1806).
His father, the general Alexandre, Viscount de Beauharnais, was guillotined on June 23, 1794. The marriage of the general’s widow, Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, to Napoleon Bonaparte on March 9, 1796, was at first resented by Eugène and his sister Hortense, but their stepfather proved kind and genuinely interested in their welfare. Eugène in turn was a useful military aide to Napoleon, particularly in the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire (Nov. 9, 1799) and the victory over the Austrians at Marengo (June 14, 1800). In 1804 Eugène received the title of prince and was appointed archchancellor of state.
