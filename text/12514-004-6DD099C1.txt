François, vicomte de Curel,  (born June 10, 1854, Metz, France—died  April 26, 1928, Paris) French dramatist and novelist, one of the brightest lights of André Antoine’s famous Théâtre-Libre, which was founded, in reaction to the established French commercial theatre, as a forum for original dramatic art.
Curel, a member of an old noble family, studied engineering, but his career was interrupted by the surrender of his native province of Lorraine to Germany in 1871, and he turned to literature.
