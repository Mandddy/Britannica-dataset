Casablanca, American film drama, released in 1942, that was loosely based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison’s unproduced play Everybody Comes to Rick’s. A fast-paced, emotionally charged romance set against the tumultuous backdrop of World War II, the film is one of the most celebrated and iconic motion pictures in history.
The film takes place in Casablanca, Morocco (then a French protectorate), where numerous Europeans are stranded after having sought refuge from Nazi occupation. With exit visas difficult to obtain from the Vichy government, two German couriers carrying valuable letters of transit are murdered on a train. Soon after, the crooked Ugarte (played by Peter Lorre) entrusts two such documents, which he plans to sell, to American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the world-weary proprietor of Rick’s Café Americain. Before he can make the sale, however, Ugarte is promptly arrested for the couriers’ murder. Later, his prospective buyers—a well-known Czech resistance leader named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his companion, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman)—arrive at the lively café. Rick immediately recognizes Ilsa, with whom he once had a brief love affair in Paris. She attempts to explain why she suddenly abandoned the relationship, but Rick, drunk and bitter, refuses to listen. The next day, Ilsa sharply informs Rick that she has been married to Laszlo since before they met.
