Prosper-Louis-Pascal Guéranger,  (born April 4, 1805, Sablé-sur-Sarthe, France—died  Jan. 30, 1875, Solesmes) monk who restored Benedictine monasticism in France and pioneered the modern liturgical revival.
Guéranger, ordained a priest in 1827, was an Ultramontanist (pro-papist) who reacted against Gallicanism, a movement advocating the administrative independence of the French hierarchy from papal control. Devoted to the Roman liturgy, he campaigned for the abolition of the various local liturgies then flourishing in France. Subsequently, he was inspired to restore Benedictine monasticism, which had been eradicated by the Revolution. In December 1832 he acquired the monastic buildings and lands of Solesmes, founded in the 11th century.
