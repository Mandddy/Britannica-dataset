Alberto Contador,  (born December 6, 1982, Madrid, Spain) Spanish cyclist who twice won the Tour de France (2007, 2009) and had a third Tour victory (2010) stripped from him after he was found guilty of doping.
Contador competed as an amateur from his mid-teens and made his professional debut in 2003. He showed early promise, winning a time trial that year at the Tour of Poland, but in 2004 his future was left in doubt after he suffered a fall during a race and subsequently underwent brain surgery to remove a blood clot. He made a remarkable recovery, however, and resumed racing in 2005, winning a stage of the Tour Down Under in Australia and earning his first overall victory as a professional rider at the Catalan Cycling Week.
