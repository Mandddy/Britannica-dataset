Saint Innocent Veniaminov, Russian Innokenty Veniaminov, original name Ivan Yevseyevich Veniaminov  (born Sept. 6 [Aug. 26, old style], 1797, Anginskoye, Irkutsk Province, Russian Empireâ€”died  April 12, [March 31, O.S.] 1879, Moscow; canonized Oct. 6, 1977) the most famous Russian Orthodox missionary priest of the 19th century, who later became Metropolitan Innocent of Moscow. He was canonized in the Russian Church.
Veniaminov began his career, from 1824 until 1839, as a parish priest, first in Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia, and then in Alaska, which was part of the Russian Empire until 1867. While in Alaska, Veniaminov learned the Aleut language, for which he invented an alphabet and charted a grammar. His book The Way to the Kingdom of Heaven, written in Aleut in 1841, gained wide appeal. After spending 10 years in the Aleutians, he moved on to Novo Arkhangelsk (now Sitka) on Baronov Island and, in 1836, began to baptize the Kolosh Indians.
