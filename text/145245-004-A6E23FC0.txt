Pancho Villa, byname of Francisco Villa, original name Doroteo Arango  (born June 5, 1878, Hacienda de Río Grande, San Juan del Río, Durango, Mexico—died July 20, 1923, Parral, Chihuahua) Mexican revolutionary and guerrilla leader who fought against the regimes of both Porfirio Díaz and Victoriano Huerta and after 1914 engaged in civil war and banditry.
Villa was the son of a field labourer and was orphaned at an early age. In revenge for an assault on his sister, he killed one of the owners of the estate on which he worked and was afterward forced to flee to the mountains, where he spent his adolescence as a fugitive.
