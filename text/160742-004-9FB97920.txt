Kārlis Ulmanis,  (born September 4, 1877, Berze, Latvia, Russian Empire—died 1942) a leader in the fight for Latvian independence in the early decades of the 20th century. He was the first head of the Latvian Republic in 1918 and again in 1936–40 and was premier in 1918, 1919–21, 1925–26, 1931–32, and 1934–40.
Ulmanis studied agronomy in Germany as a young man and afterward worked to improve dairy farming and cattle breeding in Latvia. During the period of upheaval at the time of the Russian Revolution of 1905, he worked to promote freedom from Russia, which had controlled the country for more than a century. The defeat of the revolution forced Ulmanis to seek exile in the United States, where he taught in the agriculture department of the University of Nebraska.
