Slide rule, a device consisting of graduated scales capable of relative movement, by means of which simple calculations may be carried out mechanically. Typical slide rules contain scales for multiplying, dividing, and extracting square roots, and some also contain scales for calculating trigonometric functions and logarithms. The slide rule remained an essential tool in science and engineering and was widely used in business and industry until it was superseded by the portable electronic calculator late in the 20th century.
The logarithmic slide rule is a compact device for rapidly performing calculations with limited accuracy. The invention of logarithms in 1614 by the Scottish mathematician John Napier and the computation and publication of tables of logarithms made it possible to effect multiplication and division by the simpler operations of addition and subtraction. Napierâ€™s early conception of the importance of simplifying mathematical calculations resulted in his invention of logarithms, and this invention made possible the slide rule.
