Piquet, card game, known since the 15th century in France.
For centuries piquet has been regarded as one of the greatest two-player card games. In 1534 François Rabelais listed it as a favorite pastime of his fictional hero Gargantua, and in 1892 the delegates to a card congress in Vienna voted it the most “classic” of all card games. Perhaps because it was also regarded as essentially aristocratic and upper-class and takes much explaining, it fell out of fashion in the 20th century. Despite its French ancestry, piquet has been played in England long enough—probably since the marriage of Charles I to Henrietta Maria of France in 1625—to have become thoroughly naturalized. There is a surprisingly accurate representation of its being played by Charles II and one of his mistresses in the film version of Forever Amber (1947). The game’s popularity among the literate is suggested by its prominence in the earliest books of instruction in card play, which date from the 17th century. It held pride of place for three centuries in various editions of Charles Cotton’s The Compleat Gamester, formed the subject of a treatise by the real Edmond Hoyle in 1744, and still remains a staple component of all self-respecting “Hoyles.” The following description is of the English club game known as rubicon piquet.
