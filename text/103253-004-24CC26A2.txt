Tintoretto, byname of Jacopo Robusti   (born c. 1518 ce, Venice [Italy]—died May 31, 1594, Venice) great Italian Mannerist painter of the Venetian school and one of the most important artists of the late Renaissance. His paintings include Vulcan Surprising Venus and Mars, the Mannerist Christ and the Adulteress, and his masterpiece of 1594, The Last Supper of San Giorgio Maggiore. Increasingly concerned with the drama of light and space, he achieved in his mature work (e.g., The Law and the Golden Calf, c. 1562) a luminous, visionary quality.
Little is known of Tintoretto’s life. In a will of 1539 he called himself an independent professional man—not a surprising description in view of his imposing and forceful personality. No documents have survived regarding Jacopo’s artistic education. His biographers, among them Carlo Ridolfi, whose book was published in 1648, speak of an apprenticeship with Titian that was broken off because of the master’s resentment of the pupil’s proud nature and exceptional accomplishment. On the other hand, a contemporary pointed out that Tintoretto’s style was formed by studying formal elements of the Tuscan school, especially those of Michelangelo, and pictorial elements derived from Titian.
