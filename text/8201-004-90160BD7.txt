Jimmy Dorsey , byname of James Francis Dorsey   (born Feb. 29, 1904, Shenandoah, Pa., U.S.—died June 12, 1957, New York, N.Y.) American musician who—both independently and with his brother Tommy—led one of the most popular big bands of the swing era. He was also a highly talented saxophone and clarinet player.
Along with his brother, Dorsey received his first musical training from his father, who was a music teacher and marching band director. He played both clarinet and alto saxophone and began playing in several bands with Tommy when they were both teenagers. In 1920 they formed their own combo, Dorsey’s Novelty Six. By 1922 the group, now known as Dorsey’s Wild Canaries, was well-known in the Baltimore, Md., area and was among the first jazz bands to broadcast on the radio. During this time Jimmy played—sometimes alone, sometimes with Tommy—in jazz groups, in big bands, and even in pit bands for Broadway musicals. In 1927 the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra began recording with an ever-changing group of musicians. Their hits included such songs as “Coquette” (1928) and “Let’s Do It” (1929), the latter featuring singer Bing Crosby. Their recordings from the late 1920s and early ’30s reveal their mastery of both the smooth popular styles that dominated their output and the more raucous Dixieland style appreciated by jazz fans.
