Sir Georg Solti, original name György Stern Solti   (born October 21, 1912, Budapest, Hungary—died September 5, 1997, Antibes, France) Hungarian-born British conductor and pianist, one of the most highly regarded conductors of the second half of the 20th century. He was especially noted for his interpretations of Romantic orchestral and operatic works.
Solti studied at the Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest with Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály. At 18 he joined the coaching staff of the Budapest Opera and made his conducting debut there in 1938. A Jew, he found safety in Zürich at the outbreak of World War II, but his alien status prevented him from conducting professionally. He won the Geneva International Piano Competition in 1942. After the war he became music director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich (1946–52), the Frankfurt Opera (1952–60), and the Royal Opera at Covent Garden (1961–71). He assumed British citizenship in 1972 and was knighted that same year.
