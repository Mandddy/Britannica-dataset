Harry L. Hopkins,  (born Aug. 17, 1890, Sioux City, Iowa, U.S.—died Jan. 29, 1946, New York City) U.S. New Deal Democratic administrator who personified the ideology of vast federal work programs to relieve unemployment in the 1930s; he continued as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s emissary and closest personal adviser during World War II.
Hopkins was a social worker in New York City through the 1920s. In response to the pressing needs arising in the economic depression stemming from the stock market crash of 1929, Hopkins was appointed (1931) executive director (later chairman) of the New York State Temporary Emergency Relief Administration established by Roosevelt, then governor. When Roosevelt became president (1933), he brought Hopkins with him to the nation’s capital. In his new post as administrator of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, he combined crusading moral fervour with executive ability.
