George Meredith,  (born Feb. 12, 1828, Portsmouth, Hampshire, Eng.—died  May 18, 1909, Box Hill, Surrey) English Victorian poet and novelist, whose novels are noted for their wit, brilliant dialogue, and aphoristic quality of language. Meredith’s novels are also distinguished by psychological studies of character and a highly subjective view of life that, far ahead of his time, regarded women as truly the equals of men. His best known works are The Ordeal of Richard Feverel (1859) and The Egoist (1879).
George Meredith, the son and grandson of tailors, was born above the family tailor shop in Portsmouth. The name Meredith is Welsh in origin, and family tradition held that its bearers were descendants of Welsh kings and chieftains. In keeping with this tradition, the young Meredith was proud and patrician in his bearing. A small inheritance from his mother, who died when he was five, enabled Meredith to attend a superior local seminary and thus early to assume the role of a young “gentleman.” Yet the sensitive boy must gradually have become conscious of the contrast between this role and his actual social status. And the reality was to become even harsher with the bankruptcy of the tailoring shop when he was about 11 and his father’s subsequent marriage to the young woman who had been their housekeeper.
