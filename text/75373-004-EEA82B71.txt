Hipparcos, in full High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite,  Earth-orbiting satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 1989 that over the next four years measured the distances to more than 100,000 stars by direct triangulation using observations of parallax from either side of Earth’s orbit around the Sun. It was named after the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who drew up an accurate star catalog in the 2nd century bc.
Hipparcos got off to a rocky start when a rocket engine failed to insert the satellite into a circular geostationary orbit, leaving the satellite in a highly elliptical orbit that passed in and out of Earth’s radiation belts. It was nevertheless able to operate, and the computer analysis was modified to take the noncircularity of the orbit into account.
