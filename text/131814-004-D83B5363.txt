George Devey,  (born 1820, London, Eng.—died  November 1886, Hastings, East Sussex) British architect who influenced nonacademic architects in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Devey was educated in London and studied painting before he trained as an architect. His considerable, and exclusively domestic, practice included designs for lodges, cottages, and country mansions containing design elements from the 15th to the 17th century. He directly influenced William Eden Nesfield and C.F.A. Voysey, who as a young man worked for Devey. Particularly influential was a Devey brick house at Betteshanger, Kent (1857), which was studied carefully by Nesfield and by the school architects E.R. Robson and J.J. Stevenson. The London School Board’s standard design from 1870, when Robson became its official architect, was based on this residence. During his lifetime Devey was best known for altering and enlarging country mansions, e.g., Penshurst Place, Kent. The necessary derivativeness of this type of work and Devey’s aversion to publicity concealed his true importance, which was overlooked by architectural historians until the middle of the 20th century.
