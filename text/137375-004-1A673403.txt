Shearwater, any member of more than a dozen species of long-winged oceanic birds belonging to the family Procellariidae (order Procellariiformes), which also includes the fulmars and the petrels. Typical shearwaters are classified in the genus Puffinus, which has approximately 20 species. Shearwaters are drab, slender-billed birds that range from 35 to 65 cm (14 to 26 inches) in length. The common name shearwater describes the birdsâ€™ habit of gliding on stiff wings along the troughs of waves. The name is sometimes also applied to the skimmers, an unrelated oceanic bird family.
Shearwaters nest in burrows on offshore islands and coastal hills in the North Atlantic, eastern South Atlantic, and Mediterranean and throughout most of the Pacific. Colonies may number hundreds of thousands of pairs, and at night, when the calling adults move in and out of the burrows, the din is deafening. A single egg is incubated in turn by the male and female, and the chick is raised by both parents.
