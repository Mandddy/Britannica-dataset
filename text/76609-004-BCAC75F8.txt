Owlet moth (family Noctuidae), also called miller ,  large worldwide group of more than 20,000 species of triangular, stout-bodied nocturnal lepidopterans. The family Noctuidae includes some of the worldâ€™s largest moths; wingspans in this diverse group range from 0.8 to 30.5 cm (0.3 to 12 inches). Although most have dull protective coloration, some tropical species are bright and iridescent.
Owlet moths are mainly night fliers, and many are attracted to lights. Hearing organs on the thorax consist of a tightly stretched membrane that is protected by an expanded hood. Most adults, using their well-developed mouthparts, feed on fruits, sap, nectar, or other sweet fluids. Large numbers of some species seasonally invade temperate areas from the tropics.
