Wacław Sierpiński,  (born March 14, 1882, Warsaw, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died October 21, 1969, Warsaw) leading figure in point-set topology and one of the founding fathers of the Polish school of mathematics, which flourished between World Wars I and II.
Sierpiński graduated from Warsaw University in 1904, and in 1908 he became the first person anywhere to lecture on set theory. During World War I it became clear that an independent Polish state might emerge, and Sierpiński, with Zygmunt Janiszewski and Stefan Mazurkiewicz, planned the future shape of the Polish mathematical community: it would be centred in Warsaw and Lvov, and, because resources for books and journals would be scarce, research would be concentrated in set theory, point-set topology, the theory of real functions, and logic. Janiszewski died in 1920, but Sierpiński and Mazurkiewicz successfully saw the plan through. At the time it seemed a narrow and even risky choice of topics, but it proved highly fruitful, and a stream of fundamental work in these areas came out of Poland until the intellectual life of the country was destroyed by the Nazis and the invading Soviet forces.
