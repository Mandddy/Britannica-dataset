Black knot, serious and progressive disease of wild and cultivated plums and cherries in North America caused by the fungus Dibotryon morbosum. The fungus can spread both sexually and asexually and initially infects twigs and branches, causing light brown swellings that turn velvety olive-green. As the disease progresses, these swellings form hard, rough, coal-black knots or galls that girdle and kill the affected parts. Older knots are often riddled with insects, and a severe infection can stunt and kill the tree. Black knot can be controlled by pruning infected parts during the winter (knots on large limbs are cut away, and the wound is treated), destroying nearby wild plums and cherries that may be affected, and spraying vegetative buds with a fungicide. Japanese plums are less susceptible than most American and European varieties.
