Palace of Diocletian, ancient Roman palace built between 295 and 305 ce at Split (Spalato), Croatia, by the emperor Diocletian as his place of retirement (he renounced the imperial crown in 305 and then lived at Split until his death in 316). The palace constitutes the main part of a UNESCO World Heritage site that was designated in 1979. It is the largest and best-preserved example of Roman palatial architecture, representing a transitional style half Greek and half Byzantine.
It was built as an imperial city-palace and a sea fortress, as well as a country house of vast proportions and magnificence, covering an area of 7 acres (3 hectares). The north-south walls extended 705 feet (215 metres), with walls measuring 7 feet (2 metres) thick and 72 feet (22 metres) high on the Adriatic side and 60 feet (18 metres) high on the north. There were 16 towers (of which 3 remain) and 4 gates: Porta Aurea (Golden Gate) in the north, Porta Argentea (Silver Gate) in the east, Porta Ferrea (Iron Gate) in the west, and Porta Aenea (Bronze Gate) in the south. The roughly rectangular ground plan was like that of a Roman military campâ€”i.e., with four arcaded avenues 36 feet (11 metres) wide meeting in the middle. Guards, slaves, and household servants were accommodated in the northern quadrants. The imperial apartments (state rooms) were in the two southern quadrants, along the width of which ran a 524-foot-long and 24-foot-wide arcaded grand gallery (probably for promenades and the display of art) that was open to scenic views of the sea and the Dalmatian coast. The Temple of Jupiter and the mausoleum of Diocletian were located in courts of the imperial section. The mausoleum was converted to a cathedral in 653 by the first bishop of Split; it is noteworthy for its fine frescoes, marble pulpit, and Romanesque carvings. The Temple of Jupiter was subsequently transformed into a baptistery, to which a beautiful Romanesque campanile was added in the 14th and 15th centuries.
