Chelsea Handler, in full Chelsea Joy Handler  (born February 25, 1975, Livingston, New Jersey, U.S.) American comedian and author known for her earthy, bawdy style and her late-night talk show, Chelsea Lately (2007â€“14).
Handler grew up in New Jersey, the youngest of six siblings. As a teen, she competed in the Miss New Jersey pageant, but she did not pursue work in performing until she was 19, when she headed to Los Angeles in hopes of starting an acting career. Eventually she switched her focus to comedy and began performing stand-up at clubs around the city. This led to a stint on Girls Behaving Badly, a hidden-camera show on the Oxygen network that premiered in 2002. Handler drew fans with her brassy, self-deprecating style and by approaching the topic of sex with an irreverence bordering on crassness. In 2005 she published her first book, My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands, a series of comedic short essays devoted to her dating life.
