Yaws, also called frambesia,  contagious disease occurring in moist tropical regions throughout the world. It is caused by a spirochete, Treponema pertenue, that is structurally indistinguishable from T. pallidum, which causes syphilis. Some syphilologists contend that yaws is merely a tropical rural form of syphilis, but yaws is not contracted primarily through sexual activity, and later systemic complications from the disease are much rarer than in syphilis. The Wassermann and Kahn tests for syphilis, however, often read positive with yaws, and there is some degree of cross-immunity. The spirochetes of yaws are present in the discharge from lesions on the skin and are transferred by direct contact to the abraded skin of an uninfected person; by contaminated clothing; and by flies that feed on the sores. The disease is most frequently contracted in early childhood, and considerable immunity to subsequent infection is acquired.
Yaws has three stages. The symptoms are an initial papule on the skin at the site of inoculation, followed by multiple cauliflower eruptions, and later, in some cases, by mutilating destruction of the skin, mucous membranes, and bones. The primary yaws sore is characterized by a wartlike thickening of the epidermis, which becomes fibrous, cracks open, bleeds easily, and discharges a serous fluid.
