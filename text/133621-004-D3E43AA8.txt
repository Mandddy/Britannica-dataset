Nathan Clifford,  (born Aug. 18, 1803, Rumney, N.H., U.S.—died  July 25, 1881, Cornish, Maine) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1858–81).
Admitted to the bar in 1827, Clifford was elected to the Maine legislature in 1830 and became an eloquent exponent of Jacksonian principles. He served four terms, the last two as speaker. In 1834 he was appointed state attorney general and in 1839 elected to the U.S. Congress. He was named attorney general by Pres. James K. Polk in 1846 and served as his special commissioner to Mexico to arrange the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican War in 1848. After completing his duties in Mexico, he returned to private practice in Maine and twice ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate before being appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1858 by Pres. James Buchanan, who had been his friend on the cabinet.
