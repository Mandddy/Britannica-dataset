Plant virus, any of a number of agents that can cause plant disease. Plant viruses are of considerable economic importance because many of them infect crop and ornamental plants. Numerous plant viruses are rodlike and can be extracted readily from plant tissue and crystallized. The majority of them lack the fatty membrane found in many animal viruses, and all contain ribonucleic acid (RNA).
Plant viruses are transmitted in a number of ways, the most important of which is through insect bites, primarily by aphids and plant hoppers. One of the most well-studied viruses, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), is spread mechanically by abrasion with infected sap. Symptoms of virus infection include colour changes, dwarfing, and tissue distortion. The appearance of streaks of colour in certain tulips is caused by virus.
