Alva Belmont, in full Alva Ertskin Smith Vanderbilt Belmont, née Alva Ertskin Smith, also called (1875–96) Alva Vanderbilt  (born Jan. 17, 1853, Mobile, Ala., U.S.—died Jan. 26, 1933, Paris, France) prominent socialite of New York City and Newport, Rhode Island, who, in her later years, became an outspoken suffragist.
Alva Smith grew up in her birthplace of Mobile, Alabama, and, after the American Civil War, in France. She married William K. Vanderbilt, grandson of Cornelius, in 1875. Although the Vanderbilts were among the richest people in the world, they were excluded from the "Four Hundred," the cream of New York society, by the arbiters of such matters, Mrs. William B. Astor and Ward McAllister. Alva Vanderbilt undertook an aggressive plan to break into the club. She commissioned the fashionable society architect Richard M. Hunt to build a $3 million mansion on Fifth Avenue, a gesture that ended McAllister’s resistance; then, in 1883, plans were made for an Olympian masquerade ball for 1,200 persons, by far the most opulent entertainment yet seen by New York. At the last moment Astor capitulated, calling on Vanderbilt in order to secure an invitation for young Caroline Astor. As a final touch Vanderbilt had Hunt build a palace—ostentatiously referred to as a "cottage"—at Newport that, with its furnishings, cost $9 million on completion in 1892. In 1895 Vanderbilt divorced her husband and, a year later, after arranging the marriage of her daughter Consuelo to the duke of Marlborough, she married Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont.
