Jack Johnson, byname of John Arthur Johnson  (born March 31, 1878, Galveston, Texas, U.S.—died June 10, 1946, Raleigh, N.C.) first black boxer to win the heavyweight championship of the world. Johnson is considered by many boxing observers to be one of the greatest heavyweights of all time.
Johnson fought professionally from 1897 to 1928 and engaged in exhibition matches as late as 1945. He won the title by knocking out champion Tommy Burns in Sydney on Dec. 26, 1908, and lost it on a knockout by Jess Willard in 26 rounds in Havana on April 5, 1915. Until his fight with Burns, racial discrimination had limited Johnson’s opportunities and purses. When he became champion, a hue and cry for a “Great White Hope” produced numerous opponents.
