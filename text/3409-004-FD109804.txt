Thomas Love Peacock,  (born Oct. 18, 1785, Weymouth, Dorset, Eng.—died  Jan. 23, 1866, Lower Halliford, Middlesex) English author who satirized the intellectual tendencies of his day in novels in which conversation predominates over character or plot. His best verse is interspersed in his novels.
Peacock met Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1812, and the two became such close friends that Shelley made Peacock executor of his will. Peacock spent several months near the Shelleys at Great Marlow in 1817, a period of great importance to his development as a writer. The ideas that lie behind many of the witty dialogues in his books probably found their origin in the conversation of Shelley and his friends. Peacock’s essay The Four Ages of Poetry (1820) provoked Shelley’s famous Defence of Poetry (written 1821, published 1840).
