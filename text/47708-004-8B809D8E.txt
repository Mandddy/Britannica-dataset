Dietrich von Choltitz,  (born November 9, 1894, Neustadt, Germany [now Prudnik, Poland]—died November 4, 1966, Baden-Baden, West Germany) German army officer who was the last commander of Nazi-occupied Paris in World War II.
Choltitz was a professional officer in the German army from 1914. He served in the invasion of Poland in 1939, the invasion of France in 1940, and the siege of Sevastopol (1941–42). After serving as commander of a panzer (armoured) corps on the Eastern Front (1943–44), he was transferred in June 1944 to France, where his corps was ordered to hold the Cotentin Peninsula after the Normandy Invasion. On August 7 Choltitz, having failed to stop the breakout of American forces into Brittany, was appointed military commander of the French capital city of Paris, German control of which was being threatened by the approaching Allied armies. Choltitz’s orders, originating with Adolf Hitler himself, were to destroy bridges, major buildings, and other key facilities in the city rather than let it fall into Allied hands undamaged. Recognizing the military futility of these orders and repelled by their barbarity, Choltitz instead agreed to a truce with French Resistance forces in the city and handed over Paris unscathed to General Jacques-Philippe Leclerc on August 25, 1944.
