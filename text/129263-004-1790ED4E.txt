Mandarin, Chinese (Pinyin) Guan or (Wade-Giles romanization) Kuan,  in imperial China, a public official of any of nine grades or classes that were filled by individuals from the ranks of lesser officeholders who passed examinations in Chinese literary classics. The word comes through the Portuguese mandarim from Malay mantri, a counselor or minister of state; the ultimate origin of the word is the Sanskrit root man-, meaning “to think.” See Chinese civil service.
