Julius Friedrich Cohnheim,  (born July 20, 1839, Demmin, Prussia—died  Aug. 15, 1884, Leipzig) pioneer of experimental pathology who helped determine the morbid changes that occur in animal tissue affected by inflammation, tuberculosis, and other disease states.
At the Pathological Institute, Berlin (1865–68), Cohnheim was an outstanding pupil of Rudolf Virchow, founder of the science of pathology. While assisting him, Cohnheim also conducted extensive research into the causes of inflammation. By 1867, he confirmed earlier suspicions that the condition results from the passage of leukocytes (white blood corpuscles) through capillary walls and into tissues, and that pus consists mainly of the debris formed by disintegration of these leukocytes. He summarized his findings in Neue Untersuchungen über die Entzündung (1873; “Recent Researches on Inflammation”).
