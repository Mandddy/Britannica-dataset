Emeline Horton Cleveland, née Emeline Horton  (born Sept. 22, 1829, Ashford, Conn., U.S.—died Dec. 8, 1878, Philadelphia, Pa.)  American physician and college professor, widely respected among her male colleagues and a strong force for professional opportunity and education for women in medicine.
Emeline Horton grew up in Madison county, New York. She worked as a teacher until she could afford to enroll at Oberlin (Ohio) College, from which she graduated in 1853. She then entered the Female (later Woman’s) Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and took her M.D. degree in 1855. While working toward her medical degree she married the Reverend Giles B. Cleveland. Her husband’s ill health ended their plan to undertake missionary work, and, after a year of private practice, Cleveland became a demonstrator of anatomy at the Female Medical College. She soon was named professor of anatomy and histology. In 1860–61, with the support of Ann Preston, a doctor at the college, Cleveland took advanced training in obstetrics at the school of the Maternité hospital in Paris. Upon her return to Philadelphia, she became chief resident at the rechartered Woman’s Medical College, a post she held until 1868. From 1862 she also taught obstetrics and diseases of women and children and carried on an extensive private practice.
