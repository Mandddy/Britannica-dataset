Irving Fisher,  (born February 27, 1867, Saugerties, New York, U.S.—died April 29, 1947, New Haven, Connecticut) American economist best known for his work in the field of capital theory. He also contributed to the development of modern monetary theory.
Fisher was educated at Yale University (B.A., 1888; Ph.D., 1891), where he remained to teach mathematics (1892–95) and economics (1895–1935). In The Purchasing Power of Money (1911), he developed the modern concept of the relationship between changes in the money supply and changes in general price levels. From 1912 to 1935, Fisher produced a total of 331 documents—including speeches, letters to newspapers, articles, reports to governmental bodies, circulars, and books—that described his plan for a dollar capable of sustaining a constant purchasing power (also known as the “compensated” dollar or “commodity” dollar). Fisher believed the dollar should be defined not by the weight of gold but by the value of gold; this value could be determined by an index number based on the price of a given set of goods.
