Drums Along the Mohawk, American adventure film, released in 1939, that was based on the historical novel of the same name by Walter D. Edmonds.
The film, set during the American Revolution, follows a young couple, Gilbert and Lana Martin (played by Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, respectively), as they begin married life together in a frontier community in the Mohawk Valley of central New York. Lana, a refined woman from Albany, initially struggles to adapt to the rustic conditions, but she soon helps her husband in working on their farm. When a band of Indians torches the farm, however, Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), a wealthy widow, allows the Martins to move into a cabin she owns and to work on her land. Gilbert joins a militia of local men seeking to protect their property from the threat of Indian attacks and later becomes wounded in a skirmish. A period of peace follows, during which Lana gives birth to a son, though the area is eventually besieged by Indians once again. Under the command of the dastardly Caldwell (John Carradine), a Tory, the Indians attempt to take a local fort, but Gilbert suddenly arrives with Continental Army troops who defeat the marauders.
