Tony Bennett, original name Anthony Dominick Benedetto  (born August 3, 1926, Astoria, Queens, New York, U.S.) American popular singer known for his smooth voice and interpretive abilities with songs in a variety of genres.
Bennett, the son of a grocer, spent his boyhood in Astoria, New York, studying singing and painting. At the behest of his vocal instructor, Bennett immersed himself in the music of instrumentalists, rather than that of vocalists, which provided him with a solid foundation in jazz. He served three years in the army during World War II and embarked on a singing career in 1949. Bennett’s break came the following year when Bob Hope heard him in a nightclub and invited him to share the stage during Hope’s engagement at New York’s Paramount Theatre. At the time, Bennett was working under the stage name of Joe Bari, which Hope thought was unmemorable. Reasoning that his given name of Anthony Benedetto was “too long to fit on the marquee,” Hope rechristened the young singer Tony Bennett.
