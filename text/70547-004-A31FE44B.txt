Euclidean geometry, the study of plane and solid figures on the basis of axioms and theorems employed by the Greek mathematician Euclid (c. 300 bce). In its rough outline, Euclidean geometry is the plane and solid geometry commonly taught in secondary schools. Indeed, until the second half of the 19th century, when non-Euclidean geometries attracted the attention of mathematicians, geometry meant Euclidean geometry. It is the most typical expression of general mathematical thinking. Rather than the memorization of simple algorithms to solve equations by rote, it demands true insight into the subject, clever ideas for applying theorems in special situations, an ability to generalize from known facts, and an insistence on the importance of proof. In Euclid’s great work, the Elements, the only tools employed for geometrical constructions were the ruler and the compass—a restriction retained in elementary Euclidean geometry to this day.
In its rigorous deductive organization, the Elements remained the very model of scientific exposition until the end of the 19th century, when the German mathematician David Hilbert wrote his famous Foundations of Geometry (1899). The modern version of Euclidean geometry is the theory of Euclidean (coordinate) spaces of multiple dimensions, where distance is measured by a suitable generalization of the Pythagorean theorem.
