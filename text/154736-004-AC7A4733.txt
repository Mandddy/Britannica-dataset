Jane Russell,  (born June 21, 1921, Bemidji, Minnesota, U.S.—died February 28, 2011, Santa Maria, California) American actress and singer who was known for her voluptuous figure and sexualized on-screen persona.
Russell’s family moved to California when she was young. Her mother, who had been an actress, encouraged Jane to explore interests in acting and music, and she studied briefly at Max Reinhardt’s Theatrical Workshop in Los Angeles and with acting coach Maria Ouspenskaya. Russell was working as a receptionist when she was discovered, landing her first role, in The Outlaw (1943). Producer and director Howard Hughes had been looking for a curvaceous leading lady to portray Rio McDonald—a young woman caught in a love triangle with gunfighters Billy the Kid and Doc Holliday—and after an extensive search he picked Russell for the sultry role. Hughes designed a special brassiere for Russell that would accentuate her assets, though the actress later claimed that she never wore it during filming. Mainly because of Russell’s provocative attire, the film faced censorship issues that kept it out of general release for several years. After a brief initial release in 1943, the movie was shelved until 1946. It was screened intermittently for the next several years amid protests and further censorship and legal battles, with an official rerelease in 1950.
