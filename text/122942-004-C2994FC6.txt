Pallas’s cat, also called Steppe Cat, or Manul,   (Felis manul), small, long-haired cat (family Felidae) native to deserts and rocky, mountainous regions from Tibet to Siberia. It was named for the naturalist Peter Simon Pallas. The Pallas’s cat is a soft-furred animal about the size of a house cat and is pale silvery gray or light brown in colour. The end of its tail is ringed and tipped with black, and some individuals have vague, dark markings on the body. The fur of the underparts is about twice as long as that of the upperparts and possibly represents an adaptation to the cat’s habitual lying and crouching on cold ground.
Head and body length ranges from 45 to 60 centimetres (18 to 24 inches) with an additional 23–30 cm for the tail; weight ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 kilograms (5.5 to 7.7 pounds). The Pallas’s cat is distinguished by a broad head with high-set eyes and low-set ears. It has been suggested that the positioning of these features is an adaptation for peering over rocky ledges; the supposition is that the cat thus exposes only a small part of itself to its prey of small mammals (such as pikas and rodents) and birds.
