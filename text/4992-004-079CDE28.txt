Thomas Warton, the Younger,  (born Jan. 9, 1728, Basingstoke, Hampshire, Eng.—died  May 21, 1790, Oxford) poet laureate from 1785 and author of the first history of English poetry, brother of the poet and critic Joseph Warton, and son of Thomas Warton the Elder (1688?–1745), professor of poetry at Oxford University (1718–26).
Warton gained an early reputation as a poet, and in his meditative, blank verse poem The Pleasures of Melancholy (published anonymously in 1747) he displayed the love of medieval and “romantic” themes that coloured much of his later work as a critic. Most of his best verse was written before he was 23. His later work included the mandatory formal odes published after his appointment as poet laureate in 1785.
