Pete Sampras, byname of Peter Sampras  (born Aug. 12, 1971, Washington, D.C., U.S.) American tennis player whose exceptional all-around game enabled him to win 14 Grand Slam singles titles, a record among male players until 2009, when it was broken by Roger Federer. Sampras during his career won seven Wimbledon singles championships (also a record; 1993–95, 1997–2000), five U.S. Open titles (1990, 1993, 1995–96, 2002), and two Australian Open championships (1994, 1997), but a win at the French Open eluded him. His domination of professional tennis during the 1990s placed him alongside his boyhood idol, Rod Laver, as one of the greatest players of all time.
Sampras took up tennis after his family moved to southern California in 1978. He immediately showed a talent for the sport, and his parents enlisted Peter Fischer, a pediatrician and amateur tennis player, to coach their son. Fischer, who had never before served as a coach, developed a comfortable relationship with Sampras and successfully guided him to the top ranks of American juniors. When Sampras was 14 years old, player and coach agreed that he should switch from his baseline style of play, which included a two-handed backhand, to a serve-and-volley game. Sampras initially struggled with the new approach, especially the single-handed backhand, but the change was ultimately a success. Sampras entered the professional ranks in 1988 and made steady progress over the next two seasons. At the 1990 U.S. Open he marked his arrival as one of the top tennis players, defeating Andre Agassi, another talented young American who would be Sampras’s primary rival during much of his career, in the finals. At 19 years of age, Sampras was the tournament’s youngest men’s singles champion.
