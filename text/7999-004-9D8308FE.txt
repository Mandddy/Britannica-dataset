Richard Dehmel,  (born Nov. 18, 1863, Wendisch-Hermsdorf, Brandenburg, Prussia [Germany]—died  Feb. 8, 1920, Blankenese, near Hamburg) German poet who exerted a major influence on young writers through his innovations in form and content.
After completing his studies at Berlin and Leipzig in 1887, Dehmel worked as an insurance official and then, in 1895, became a freelance writer. He chose naturalistic social themes for his early works and was one of the first major poets to write about the misery of the working classes. Influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche, he extolled individualism and a life of uninhibited instincts and passion, but at the same time he felt drawn to self-sacrifice and the search for harmonious ethical ideas. This conflict shaped both his tempestuous personal life and the content and style of his work. The latter is characterized by passionate and vigorous expression and by an ecstatic rhetoric that can be sensitive at its finest and sensational at its worst. In his first collection of poems, Erlösungen (1891; “Redemptions”), the conflict is expressed in the opposition of unbridled sensuality and ascetic self-discipline. Dehmel found a resolution of the conflict through his belief in the mystical power of love and sex. He came to view the sensual relations between a man and a woman as the basis for a full development of the human personality and for a higher spiritual life. This is the theme of his cyclical epic poem, Zwei Menschen (1903; “Two People”). His treatment of sexual themes was not only passionate but, for the times, shockingly frank.
