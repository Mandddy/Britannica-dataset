Niagara River, river that is the drainage outlet for the four upper Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie), having an aggregate basin area of some 260,000 square miles (673,000 square km). Flowing in a northerly direction from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, a distance of about 35 miles (56 km), the Niagara constitutes part of the boundary between the United States and Canada, separating New York state from the province of Ontario. The relatively high, steady flow and steep gradient (about 326 feet [99 metres]) of the river combine to make it one of the best sources of hydroelectric power in North America. About halfway along the riverâ€™s course lies Niagara Falls, one of the major scenic spectacles of the continent. U.S. and Canadian cities of the same name stand on either bank of the river.
From its head at Lake Erie, the river flows through a single channel for about 5 miles (8 km). It is then divided into two channels by Strawberry and Grand islands, the eastern, or U.S., channel running for about 15 miles (24 km), the western, or Canadian, for about 12 miles. At the foot of Grand Island the two merge again about 3 miles (5 km) above Niagara Falls. From Lake Erie to the upper rapids the river descends about 10 feet (3 metres), whereas in the short rapids it falls 50 feet (15 metres) before pouring over the falls.
