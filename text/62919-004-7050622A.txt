Proofreading, reading and marking corrections on a proof or other copy of the text of articles and books before publication. Proofreading dates from the early days of printing. A contract of 1499 held the author finally responsible for correction of proofs. In modern practice, proofs are made first from a galley, a long tray holding a column of type, and hence are called galley proofs; the term is sometimes also used for the first copy produced in photocomposition and other forms of typesetting that do not involve metal type.
Galley proofs, and the later proofs of the type arranged into page form, usually bear queries (regarding possible errors of fact) arising through the proofreader’s skill, which involves more than assuring an exact correspondence between the copy given to the printer and its printed form. Lawsuits between printers and authors, errata sheets, authors’ apologies and complaints at not seeing proof in printed books, all were common through the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries; and even in modern publication they are not unknown.
