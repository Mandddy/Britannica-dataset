Hermann Rorschach,  (born November 8, 1884, Zürich, Switzerland—died April 2, 1922, Herisau) Swiss psychiatrist who devised the inkblot test that bears his name and that was widely used clinically for diagnosing psychopathology.
The eldest son of an art teacher, Rorschach considered becoming an artist but chose medicine instead. As a secondary school student, he was nicknamed Kleck, meaning “inkblot,” because of his interest in sketching. He attended several universities before receiving his M.D. from the University of Zürich in 1912. Then he worked in Russia for a year before returning to Switzerland to practice. For several years his main interest was psychoanalysis, and he became a staunch advocate of the then new psychoanalytic technique in Swiss medical circles. He was elected vice president of the Swiss Psychoanalytic Society in 1919.
