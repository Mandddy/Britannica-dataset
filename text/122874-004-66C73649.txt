Richard Thompson,  (born April 3, 1949, London, England) English guitarist, singer, and songwriter who earned critical acclaim with his masterful musicianship and darkly witty lyrics.
Thompson’s career began in the late 1960s as a member of Fairport Convention, whose intermingling of traditional British folk songs, Bob Dylan obscurities, and haunting original compositions (many by Thompson) inaugurated British folk rock. Along with the impassioned vocals of Sandy Denny, Thompson’s intricate, stinging guitar playing gave Fairport Convention its rock edge. The fatalism of English folk ballads remained a hallmark of his songwriting.
