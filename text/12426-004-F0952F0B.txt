Darter,  any of about 100 species of small, slender freshwater fishes constituting the subfamily Etheostominae of the family Percidae (order Perciformes; sometimes given family standing as the Etheostomidae). All the darters are native to eastern North America. They live near the bottom of clear streams, darting quickly about when feeding or when disturbed. They prey on such small aquatic animals as insects and worms.
Like other members of the family, darters possess two dorsal fins. Their size ranges from 2.5 to 23 cm (1 to 9 inches), but the majority of darters are 5â€“7 cm long. Some darters are among the most brightly coloured fishes in North America, the males becoming especially colourful during the spring breeding season. Spawning habits vary. Some species scatter or bury their eggs and abandon them; in other species, the males establish nests and guard the eggs until hatched.
