Sabratha, also spelled Sabrata,  western-most of the three cities of ancient Tripolis, located near the modern town of Ṣabrātah, west of Tripoli, in Libya. Founded by the Carthaginians as a trading post, it was first permanently settled in the 4th century bc. Sabratha had a modest natural harbour, later improved by the Romans, and together with Oea (Tripoli) it served as an outlet for the trans-Saharan caravan route through Ghadames (Ghudāmis). After a period of semi-independence following the fall of Carthage in 146 bc, it passed under Roman rule and thereafter enjoyed considerable prosperity. Rebuilt after a disastrous sack by the Austuriani (c. ad 365), it declined rapidly in the 5th century under Vandal misrule. A revival that followed under the Byzantines was on a greatly reduced scale, and soon after the Arab conquest (643) the city ceased to exist.
Archaeological excavation has uncovered more than half the area of the ancient city, including the forum area, many of the harbourside installations, and a large 2nd-century residential quarter adjoining a theatre. Other Roman buildings include baths, temples, and fountains; Christian remains include a catacomb and four churches.
