Olive shell,  any of the marine snails that constitute the family Olividae (subclass Prosobranchia of the class Gastropoda). Fossils of the genus Oliva are common from the Eocene Epoch (57.8 to 36.6 million years ago) to the present. The shell, which is distinctive and easily recognizable, has a pointed apex and rapidly expands outward to the main body whorl. It is oval in shape, with a long and narrow aperture, and possesses an agatelike sheen and fine markings. Folds are developed on the end of the body whorl in a characteristic pattern.
Olives burrow in sandy bottoms. Common in southeastern American waters is the lettered olive (Oliva sayana), about 6 cm (2.5 inches) long. Abundant in the Indo-Pacific region is the 8-centimetre (3-inch) orange-mouthed olive (O. sericea).
