Phil Donahue, byname of Phillip John Donahue  (born December 21, 1935, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.) American television personality who pioneered the noncelebrity talk show.
Donahue began as a reporter and anchor at a Dayton, Ohio, radio station (1959–67) and then hosted The Phil Donahue Show on television (1967–74). With his syndicated talk show, produced first in Chicago (1974–85) and later in New York City (1985–96), he became known for his aggressive and unconventional style of interviewing, which involved much coaxing and prodding of guests. Donahue was among the first to tackle controversial subjects on national television. He often focused on a topical social issue, which was discussed by a panel of guests affected by it. Donahue’s show won some 20 Emmy awards.
