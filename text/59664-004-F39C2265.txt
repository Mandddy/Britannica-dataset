Intolerance, in full Intolerance: Love’s Struggle Throughout the Ages or Intolerance: A Sun-Play of the Ages,  epic American silent film, released in 1916, that is notable for its vast sets and for its intricate plot structure. A plea for tolerance, it was director D.W. Griffith’s response to the censorship and controversy that arose over the overt racism found in his previous film, The Birth of a Nation (1915).
One of cinema’s most impressive epics, Intolerance spans the course of 2,500 years and examines human failings and prejudices through various dramatic set pieces. Crosscutting between four separate stories—the fall of ancient Babylon to the hordes of the Persian king Cyrus in 539 bce, the Crucifixion of Jesus, the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of the Huguenots in France in 1572, and a contemporary story dealing with a wrongfully condemned man—Intolerance shows the human race’s propensity for intolerance through the ages.
