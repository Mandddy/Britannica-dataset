Gyorgy Kepes,  (born October 4, 1906, Selyp, Hungary—died December 29, 2001, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.) Hungarian-born American painter, designer, photographer, teacher, and writer who had considerable influence on many areas of design.
Shortly after his graduation in 1928 from the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Budapest, Kepes experimented with photograms, photographic prints made by placing objects on sensitized paper and exposing the paper to light. Later, he made prints he called “photo-drawings,” in which he applied paint to a glass plate that he then used as though it were a negative.
