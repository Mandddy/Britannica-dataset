The Hill, American film drama, released in 1965, that was an acclaimed work of Neorealism from director Sidney Lumet.
Set in a British military prison in the Libyan desert during World War II, The Hill centres on a group of soldiers jailed for such offenses as insubordination, drunkenness, and profiteering. They are guarded by a cruel sergeant (played by Ian Hendry) who delights in torturing them both physically and psychologically, as when he forces the prisoners to make repeated climbs up an artificial hill. After a soldier dies, attempts to expose the inhumane conditions are thwarted when revenge-seeking prisoners kill the guard.
