Lincoln, county, south central New Mexico, U.S. It is a rugged region in the Basin and Range Province, with green hills and large plains surrounding and separating high mountain ranges. The plains are eroded, with canyons and the beds of dry streams; the tree-covered mountains include the Sierra Blanca, Sierra Oscura, Gallinas (with 8,615-foot [2,625-metre] Gallinas Peak), Jicarilla (with 9,650-foot [2,941-metre] Carrizo Mountain), and Capitan (with 10,083-foot [3,073-metre] Capitan Peak). Much of southwestern Lincoln county is covered by the Malpais, a region of lava beds whitened by dust; the lava originated in Little Black Peak. Valley of Fires National Recreation Area is in the Malpais; the county also includes the Lincoln and Cibola national forests, White Mountain Wilderness, Lincoln State Monument, and Smokey Bear Capitan Historical State Park.
The town of Lincoln was settled in 1849 and became the county seat when Lincoln county was established in 1869; at that time Lincoln was the largest county in the United States, covering one-fourth of New Mexico. The town was the centre of the Lincoln County War (1878), fought between rival merchants for economic domination. It began with accusations of cattle rustling and escalated to murder and a five-day gun battle at the courthouse. The teen-aged killer Billy the Kid (William Bonney) figured prominently in the carnage, killing a sheriff and escaping from jail. Gold was discovered at White Oaks in 1879, leading to development of the countyâ€™s mineral resources.
