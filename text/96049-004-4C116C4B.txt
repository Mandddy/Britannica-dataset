Vesuvius, Italian Vesuvio,  active volcano that rises above the Bay of Naples on the plain of Campania in southern Italy. Its western base rests almost upon the bay. The height of the cone in 1980 was 4,198 feet (1,280 metres), but it varies considerably after each major eruption. At about 1,968 feet a high semicircular ridge, called Mount Somma, begins, girding the cone on the north and rising to 3,714 feet. Between Mount Somma and the cone is the Valle del Gigante (Giantâ€™s Valley). At the summit of the cone is a large crater about 1,000 feet deep and 2,000 feet across; it was formed in the eruption of 1944. More than two million people live in the area of Vesuvius and on its lower slopes. There are industrial towns along the coast of the Bay of Naples and small agricultural centres on the northern slopes.
Vesuvius probably originated somewhat less than 200,000 years ago. Although a relatively young volcano, Vesuvius had been dormant for centuries before the great eruption of 79 ce that buried the cities of Pompeii and Stabiae under ashes and lapilli and the city of Herculaneum under a mudflow. The writer Pliny the Younger, who was staying at a place west of Naples, gave an excellent account of the catastrophe in two letters to the historian Tacitus. Between the years 79 and 1631, several eruptions were reported. Confirmed eruptions occurred in 203, 472, 512, 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007, and 1036. The explosions of 512 were so severe that Theodoric the Goth released the people living on the slopes of Vesuvius from payment of taxes.
