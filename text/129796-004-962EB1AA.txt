Usain Bolt, in full Usain St. Leo Bolt  (born August 21, 1986, Montego Bay, Jamaica) Jamaican sprinter who won three gold medals (in the 100-metre race, the 200-metre race, and the 4 × 100-metre relay) in an unprecedented three straight Olympic Games and is widely considered the greatest sprinter of all time.
Bolt, the son of grocers in Jamaica’s rural Trelawny parish, excelled as a cricket fast bowler in his preteen years. He developed a deep affection for the European football (soccer) teams Real Madrid and Manchester United, but his school coaches steered him toward track and field. Bolt first marked himself as a track prodigy at the 2002 world junior championships. In that meet, racing before a crowd of 36,000 in Jamaica’s National Stadium in Kingston, Bolt—just 15 years old at the time—won gold in the 200 metres, becoming the youngest-ever male world junior champion in any event. At age 16 Bolt cut the junior (age 19 and under) 200-metre world record to 20.13 sec, and at 17 he ran the event in 19.93 sec, becoming the first teenager to break 20 seconds in the race. However, hampered by a hamstring injury, he failed to advance beyond the 200-metre heats at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece, and placed last in the 2005 world track-and-field championships final.
