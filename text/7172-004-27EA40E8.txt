Celery-top pine, also called adventure bay pine,  (species Phyllocladus asplenifolius), slow-growing ornamental and timber conifer of the family Phyllocladaceae (placed in the Podocarpaceae family by some botanists), native to temperate rain forests of Tasmania at elevations from sea level to 750 metres (2,500 feet). The tree is shrubby at high elevations but may grow to 18 metres (60 feet) and occasionally 30 metres (100 feet) in lower areas. The irregularly arranged branches bear inconspicuous, scalelike leaves; leaf functions are performed mainly by deciduous, green branchlets that are flattened into leathery, leaflike phylloclades resembling celery leaflets.
