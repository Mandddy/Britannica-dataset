Julius II, original name Giuliano della Rovere   (born Dec. 5, 1443, Albisola, Republic of Genoa—died  Feb. 21, 1513, Rome) greatest art patron of the papal line (reigned 1503–13) and one of the most powerful rulers of his age. Although he led military efforts to prevent French domination of Italy, Julius is most important for his close friendship with Michelangelo and for his patronage of other artists, including Bramante and Raphael. He commissioned Michelangelo’s “Moses” and paintings in the Sistine Chapel and Raphael’s frescoes in the Vatican.
Giuliano was the son of the impoverished Rafaello della Rovere, Pope Sixtus IV’s only brother. In 1468 he became a Franciscan, and in 1471 Sixtus IV made him a cardinal. In this office Giuliano displayed all of the attributes of cupidity and corruption of an unscrupulous Renaissance prince. The Pope lavished on him six bishoprics in France and three in Italy along with an abundance of wealthy abbeys and benefices. The Cardinal, who lacked any interest in spiritual pursuits, became an outstanding patron of the arts. He is shown with his protégés in Melozzo da Forlì’s superb fresco of Sixtus IV in the Vatican Museum.
