Edie Falco, in full Edith Falco  (born July 5, 1963, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.) American actress who was perhaps best known for playing Carmela Soprano on the HBO series The Sopranos (1999–2007).
Falco was the daughter of artistic parents, a jazz drummer and an actress, and she grew up in the blue-collar Long Island suburbs of Northport and West Islip. She studied acting at the State University of New York at Purchase. After graduating in 1986 Falco moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. Auteur and fellow SUNY Purchase graduate Hal Hartley gave her two of her first professional roles, in his films The Unbelievable Truth (1989) and Trust (1990). While waiting tables and performing at birthday parties to supplement her acting income, Falco landed parts in such movies as the independent film Laws of Gravity (1992) and Woody Allen’s Bullets over Broadway (1994).
