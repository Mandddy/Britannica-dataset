Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg,  (born Jan. 3, 1737, Tondern, Schleswig [now Tønder, Den.]—died  Nov. 1, 1823, Altona, near Hamburg [Germany]) German poet, critic, and theorist of the Sturm und Drang (“Storm and Stress”) literary movement, whose Briefe über die Merkwürdigkeiten der Literatur (1766–67; “Letters About the Peculiarities of Literature”) contained the first definite formulation of the critical principles of this movement: its enthusiasm for Shakespeare, its preoccupation with youthful genius, and its emphasis on the importance of unbridled emotion.
After studying law, Gerstenberg entered the Danish military service and took part in the war with Russia in 1762. He left the service and spent the next 12 years in Copenhagen, where he became a friend of Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, the leading writer of the German Enlightenment. During that time he wrote Gedicht eines Skalden (1766; “Poems of an Old Norse Bard”), in which he introduced bardic poetry into German literature with the use of material and themes from Norse antiquity. His powerful and gruesome tragedy Ugolino (1768) ranges in its expression from the heroic to the macabre. During his Copenhagen years he also wrote the text of a cantata, Ariadne auf Naxos (1767), that was set to music by Johann Adolph Scheibe and Johann Christian Bach and later adapted for a well-known duodrama by Jiří Antonín Benda.
