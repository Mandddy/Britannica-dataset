Emory College was chartered in 1836 by the Georgia Methodist Conference. It was then located in the town of Oxford, Georgia (now the site of the universityâ€™s Oxford College). The college was closed during the American Civil War and did not reopen until 1866. The School of Medicine, which had its sources in the Atlanta Medical College (founded 1854) and Southern Medical College (founded 1878), became part of the institution in 1915, the same year Emory was chartered as a university. Four years later Emory College joined the schools of law, theology, and medicine at a new campus in Atlanta, which had been endowed by Coca-Cola magnate Asa Griggs Candler; in 1919 the university also opened the business and graduate schools. The university awarded its first Ph.D. in 1948. Women were first admitted to the university in 1917 (to the law school), and Emory became completely coeducational in 1953. Notable alumni include former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, historian and biographer Dumas Malone, and historian and Pulitzer Prize winner C. Vann Woodward.
