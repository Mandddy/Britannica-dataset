Sir Francis Edward Younghusband,  (born May 31, 1863, Murree, India—died July 31, 1942, Lytchett Minster, Dorset, England) British army officer and explorer whose travels, mainly in northern India and Tibet, yielded major contributions to geographical research; he also forced the conclusion of the Anglo-Tibetan Treaty (September 6, 1904) that gained Britain long-sought trade concessions.
Younghusband entered the army in 1882 and in 1886–87 crossed Central Asia from Beijing to Yarkand (now in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, China). Continuing on to India by way of the long-unused Mustagh (Muztag) Pass of the Karakoram Range, he proved the range to be the water divide between India and Turkistan. On two later expeditions to Central Asia he explored the Pamirs (mountains).
