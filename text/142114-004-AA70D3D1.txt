Berlin Zoological Garden and Aquarium, German Zoologischer Garten und Aquarium Berlin,  zoo and aquarium in Berlin, containing one of the world’s largest and most comprehensive animal collections. It is generally considered the oldest zoo in Germany, having been founded in 1841, when the Prussian King Frederick William IV presented his pheasantry and menagerie to the citizens. The zoological garden was officially opened in 1844 with municipal support. Many rare species, including pygmy hippopotamuses, Indian elephants, and orangutans, have been bred there. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, 4,000 birds and mammals and 8,300 aquarium specimens were housed in the zoo. The grounds were totally destroyed during the war, however, and only 91 animals survived.
Rebuilding was begun in 1952, and by the early 21st century the Berlin Zoological Garden and Aquarium boasted more than 18,000 animals belonging to some 1,300 species. The zoo occupies about 99 acres (40 hectares), and the aquarium is housed in a four-story building. The Berlin Zoological Garden has the world’s best collection of wild cattle—it was the first zoo to breed the mountain anoa—and excellent collections of birds of prey, cranes, and antelopes. The zoo also maintains the international studbooks for gaur and both black and white rhinoceroses.
