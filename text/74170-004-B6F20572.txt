Branch Davidian, member of an offshoot group of the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Church that made headlines on February 28, 1993, when its Mount Carmel headquarters near Waco, Texas, was raided by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF); four federal agents were killed in the assault. A lengthy standoff between the group and government agents then followed. It ended on April 19, after some 80 members of the group, including their leader David Koresh, died when the Mount Carmel complex was burned to the ground following an attempted entrance by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents.
The Branch Davidians are one of several groups that continued the work of Victor Houteff (1885–1955), a Bulgarian emigrant to the United States and Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) layman who in a set of tracts entitled "Shepherd’s Rod" (1929) called for reform of the SDA church. Having been rebuffed by Adventist leaders, Houteff and his original followers settled near Waco in 1935 and began to prepare for what they believed was the imminent return of Jesus, complaining that the Adventists had abandoned this task in favour of worldly pursuits. They lived a simple life and avoided most commercial forms of entertainment. The hardworking community became self-sustaining, and its literature circulated to a growing group of believers across the country.
