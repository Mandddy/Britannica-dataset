Thomas D’Arcy McGee,  (born April 13, 1825, Carlingford, County Louth, Ire.—died  April 7, 1868, Ottawa, Ont., Can.) Irish-Canadian writer and chief political orator of the Canadian confederation movement.
An Irish patriot, McGee was associated with The Nation (1846–48), the literary organ of the Young Ireland political movement (which called for the study of Irish history and the revival of the Irish language). He was implicated in the abortive Irish rebellion of 1848 and fled to the United States, where he established two newspapers, the New York Nation and the American Celt. He gradually came to advocate peaceful reforms for Ireland, rather than the revolution advocated by extremists, and in 1857 he moved to Canada. He immediately began an active career in public life, being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Canada in 1858 and serving there until his death. He held ministerial posts in several governments during the 1860s, and he played an active and leading part in the movement that resulted in 1867 in the confederation of the Canadian colonies. According to his belief that literary and cultural nationalism must go along with political involvement, he encouraged the development of a Canadian culture and wrote nationalist poetry. He was assassinated in Ottawa, presumably for remarks made against the Canadian Fenians, the Irish nationalists in Canada. Selections from McGee’s writings appear in two edited collections: The Poems of Thomas D’Arcy McGee (1869) and D’Arcy McGee: A Collection of Speeches and Addresses (1937).
