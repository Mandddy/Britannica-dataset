Callicrates, also spelled Kallikrates   (flourished  5th century bc) Athenian architect who designed the Temple of Athena Nike on the Athenian Acropolis and, with Ictinus, the Parthenon.
It is known from an inscription of 449 bc (the year of the signing of peace with Persia) that the Senate commissioned Callicrates to construct a temple to Athena Nike (also known as the Wingless Victory) on the Athenian Acropolis. Callicrates designed the temple to be of pentelic marble, small in size, and Ionic in order; it was to be built on the bastion of the southwestern corner of the Acropolis. Construction finally began in 427 bc, and the temple was completed in 424 bc.
