Offal, also called Variety Meats,  any of various nonmuscular parts of the carcasses of beef and veal, mutton and lamb, and pork, which are either consumed directly as food or used in the production of other foods. Variety meats have been a part of the human diet since the invention of cooking, which rendered the otherwise indigestible animal parts edible. In nutritional terms, several variety meats are richer in certain vitamins, minerals, and forms of protein than muscle tissue; calf’s liver, for example, is a major dietary source of iron, and sweetbread (thymus) is considerably higher in the water-soluble protein albumin than is beef.
Beef offal includes the stomachs, tripe, or large stomach, brains, heart, liver, tongue, and kidneys. For young beef, or veal, a number of additional parts, such as spinal marrow, trotters (feet), mesentery, and the sweetbread, are counted among the variety meats. Mutton and lamb offal includes the kidneys, tongue, brains, feet, stomach, heart, liver, and lights, or lungs. In pork, the designation includes the liver, kidneys, brains, trotters, and head. Pigs’ intestines are used as containers in the manufacture of sausages, and pigs’ blood is an ingredient in black pudding.
