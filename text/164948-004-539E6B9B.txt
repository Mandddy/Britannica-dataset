Oliver Sacks, in full Oliver Wolf Sacks  (born July 9, 1933, London, England—died August 30, 2015, New York, New York, U.S.) British neurologist and writer who won acclaim for his sympathetic case histories of patients with unusual neurological disorders.
Sacks spent most of his childhood in London, though his parents (his father was a general practitioner and his mother a surgeon) sent him to a boarding school for four years during World War II to escape the air raids then strafing the city. Sacks attended Queen’s College, Oxford, where he received a bachelor’s degree in physiology in 1954 and a medical degree in 1958. He completed an internship at Middlesex Hospital in London in 1959 and served as house surgeon of Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham in 1960. Sacks left England for the United States to accept an internship at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco (1961–62) before serving as a resident in neurology (1962–65) at the University of California, Los Angeles.
