Kenenisa Bekele,  (born June 13, 1982, near Bekoji, Ethiopia) Ethiopian long-distance runner who won Olympic gold medals in the 10,000 metres in 2004 and in both the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres in 2008.
Like many of his countrymen, Bekele admired Ethiopian Olympic gold medal-winning runners Haile Gebrselassie, Fatuma Roba, and Bekoji native Derartu Tulu, but his first athletic love was football (soccer). Bekele attended school through the ninth grade, and it was at school that he was introduced to running. He finished fourth in his first race, but in 1998 he won a provincial cross-country title and placed sixth in the Ethiopian junior championships. His success led to an invitation to join the Mugher Cement Factory team, coached by Tolosa Kotu, then the Ethiopian national marathon coach.
