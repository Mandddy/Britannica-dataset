Mihály Vörösmarty,  (born Dec. 1, 1800, Nyék, Hung.—died  Nov. 19, 1855, Pest) poet and dramatist who helped make the literature of Hungary truly Hungarian during the era (1825–49) of social reforms. By ridding Hungarian literature of overwhelming classical and German influence, he made it national not only in language but in spirit.
Born into an impoverished noble family, Vörösmarty soon had to provide for himself. From the age of 15 as a schoolboy, and later while studying law, he supported himself by private tutoring. In 1825 he published an epic poem, Zalán futása (“The Flight of Zalán”), describing the conquest of Hungary by Árpád. The epic has great artistic merit, but its resounding success was partly caused by the general patriotic upsurge of the period, which clamoured for a work describing the glorious past of the Hungarian nation.
