Sir Jonathan Hutchinson,  (born July 23, 1828, Selby, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  June 26, 1913, Haslemere, Surrey) British surgeon, pathologist, pioneer in the study of congenital syphilis.
As Surgeon to the London Hospital (1859–83) and professor of surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons (1879–83), he became an authority on eye and skin diseases, especially leprosy. He was best known, however, for his lifelong study of syphilis. He introduced “Hutchinson’s triad” for the diagnosis of the inherited, or congenital, form of the disease: notched, narrow-edged permanent incisors (Hutchinson’s teeth); interstitial keratitis, an inflammation with occlusion of the cornea of the eye; and labyrinthine disease, a disorder of the inner ear. He was knighted in 1908.
