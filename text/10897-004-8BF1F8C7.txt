Huascar, in full Inti Cusi Huallpa Huáscar (“Sun of Joy”)   (died 1532, Cajamarca, Peru) Inca chieftain, legitimate heir to the Inca empire, who lost his inheritance and his life in rivalry with his younger half brother Atahuallpa, who in turn was defeated and executed by the Spanish conquerors under Francisco Pizarro.
Huascar succeeded his father in 1525 but was given only part of the empire (Cuzco), while about one-fifth of it (Quito) was left to Atahuallpa. Although at first Atahuallpa agreed to the division, he soon began to tire of the limits upon his power and started an armed rebellion. Huascar led his troops north to subdue the threat to his supremacy, but Atahuallpa was consistently victorious. Huascar fled Cuzco with the remnants of his army but was apprehended and compelled to watch the murder of his family, friends, and supporters. He was then ordered to be taken to Atahuallpa’s residence at Cajamarca. This was the state of affairs when Francisco Pizarro arrived in 1532. After the Spaniard succeeded in his great conquest, Atahuallpa feared that Pizarro might return Huascar to power, and so he ordered his brother’s assassination.
