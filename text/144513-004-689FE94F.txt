Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, original name Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela, original Xhosa name Nkosikazi Nobandle Nomzamo Madikizela  (born September 26, 1936, Bizana, Pondoland district, Transkei [now in Eastern Cape], South Africa) South African social worker and activist considered by many black South Africans to be the “Mother of the Nation.” She was the second wife of Nelson Mandela, from whom she separated in 1992 after her questionable behaviour and unrestrained militancy alienated fellow antiapartheid activists, including her husband.
The daughter of a history teacher, Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela moved to Johannesburg in 1953 to study pediatric social work. She met Mandela in 1956, became his devoted coworker, and married him in 1958. At the start of her husband’s long imprisonment (1962–90), Madikizela-Mandela was banned (severely restricted in travel, association, and speech) and for years underwent almost continual harassment by the South African government and its security forces; she spent 17 months in jail in 1969–70 and lived in internal exile from 1977 to 1985. During these years she did social and educational work and became a heroine of the antiapartheid movement. Her reputation was seriously marred in 1988–89, however, when she was linked with the beating and kidnapping of four black youths, one of whom was murdered by her chief bodyguard.
