Paul Scarron,  (baptized July 4, 1610, Paris, Fr.—died Oct. 7, 1660, Paris) French writer who contributed significantly to the development of three literary genres: the drama, the burlesque epic, and the novel. He is best known today for Le Roman comique (“The Comic Novel”) and as the first husband of Françoise d’Aubigné, marquise de Maintenon, the influential second wife of King Louis XIV.
Scarron’s origins were bourgeois, and it was originally intended that he should enter the church. After a period in Brittany and a visit to Rome, however, Scarron settled in Paris and devoted himself to writing. His first works were burlesques. The poet Marc-Antoine Girard de Saint-Amant had already started the vogue for parodies of the classics, but Scarron is mainly responsible for making the burlesque one of the characteristic literary forms of the mid-17th century. His seven-volume Virgile travesty (1648–53) had a tremendous success. Modern readers, perhaps because they are less impressed than Scarron’s contemporaries by the daring of parodying the Aeneid, often find the humour facile and too drawn out.
