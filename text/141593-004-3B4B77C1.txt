Pieter Arnoldus Cronjé,  (born Oct. 4, 1836, Colesberg, Cape Colony [now in South Africa]—died  Feb. 4, 1911, Potchefstroom, Transvaal, S.Af.) Boer general who played a prominent part in the early stages of the South African War.
Cronjé was born in the Cape Colony but was taken in early life to the Transvaal, during the Great Trek. In the Transvaal, in November 1880, he began a rebellion against British rule, leading resistance to the distraint of goods of a farmer who had refused to pay taxes. In the ensuing war, he commanded at Potchefstroom and forced the surrender of the British garrison just as a general armistice was being arranged (March 1881). When the Transvaal achieved limited independence later in 1881, Cronjé entered the Volksraad (parliament), where he supported President Paul Kruger. When the South African War broke out in 1899, Cronjé, then a general, assumed supreme command in the west and began the siege of Mafeking. He successfully repulsed a general British attack on his position at Magersfontein on Dec. 11, 1899. In the campaign of February 1900, Cronjé, still at Magersfontein, opposed Field Marshal Lord Roberts’s army but failed to prevent the British relief of Kimberley. Retreating eastward, he was surrounded at Paardeberg, where, after inflicting heavy losses on the British, he was forced to surrender with about 4,000 men. He was a prisoner at St. Helena until the end of the war (1902). He then retired to Klerksdorp.
