Ernst Jünger,  (born March 29, 1895, Heidelberg, Ger.—died Feb. 16, 1998, Wilflingen) German novelist and essayist, an ardent militarist who was one of the most complex and contradictory figures in 20th-century German literature.
Jünger joined the French Foreign Legion in 1913, but his father had him brought back to Germany. In 1914 he volunteered for the German Army at the outbreak of World War I and served as an officer on the Western Front throughout the conflict. As a soldier Jünger was conspicuous for his bravery: he was wounded at least seven times, and in 1918 he was awarded the Pour le Mérite medal, Germany’s highest military decoration. After the war he published In Stahlgewittern (1920; The Storm of Steel), a novel in the form of a diary; it contains vivid recollections of his life in the trenches and his experiences in combat as a company commander. In a dispassionate, matter-of-fact voice, Jünger describes the heroism and suffering displayed by himself and his fellow soldiers in the brutal fighting on the Western Front. The Storm of Steel was a success with critics and public alike in Germany and other countries. Two years later he published Der Kampf als inneres Erlebnis (“Combat as an Internal Experience”).
