Cotillion, original name cotillon,  late 18th-century and 19th-century French court dance, popular also in England. A precursor of the quadrille, the cotillion was danced by four couples standing in a square set. The first and third, then the second and fourth, couples executed various series of geometric figures.
During the 19th century cotillion patterns became more varied, and the dancing was combined with the giving of presents. The word finally came to denote ballroom dancing for couples that had little relation to the original form.
