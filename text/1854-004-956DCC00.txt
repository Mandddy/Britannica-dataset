Abílio Manuel Guerra Junqueiro,  (born Sept. 17, 1850, Freixo de Espada à Cinta, Trás-os-Montes, Port.—died  July 7, 1923, Lisbon) poet whose themes of social protest and reform, expressed in a blend of grandiloquence and satire, have identified him as the poet par excellence of the Portuguese Revolution of 1910.
Junqueiro was a leader among the revolutionary group of students at the University of Coimbra known as the Generation of Coimbra, who accomplished, first, the overthrow of Portuguese literary Romanticism and, later, the overthrow of the monarchy. His reputation as a poet dates from his abandonment of an early Romantic style for the realism of A morte de D. João (1874; “The Death of Don Juan”), in which he portrays the great lover as a debased seducer, the symbol of false sentimentality perpetuated by Romanticism. He next caused a stir with A velhice do padre eterno (1885; “The Old Age of the Eternal Father”), which attacked the image of God with the same ruthlessness. In a less polemical phase, he celebrated Portuguese rural and village life in Os simples (1892; “The Simple Ones”), in which his lyrical quality, often overdeclamatory, is at its purest.
