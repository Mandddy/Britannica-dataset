Robie House, in full Frederick C. Robie House,  residence designed for Frederick C. Robie by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in Hyde Park, a neighbourhood on the South Side of Chicago. Completed in 1910, the structure is the culmination of Wright’s modern design innovations that came to be called the Prairie style. With its restless, interlocking horizontal volumes, continuous surfaces, banded windows, absence of traditional ornament, and hidden entryway, the house was a complete departure from traditional residential architecture.
In many ways Robie the client perfectly suited the maverick architect. He was an entrepreneur and an inventor, and, as the owner of bicycle and automobile companies, he required—among other oddities—a three-car garage, which was exceedingly rare in 1910. The site of the house, near the University of Chicago (from which Robie’s wife had graduated), comprised the equivalent of three city lots, the elongated shape of which allowed Wright to create an attenuated horizontal composition.
