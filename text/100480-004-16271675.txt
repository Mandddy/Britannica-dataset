Orsay Museum, French Musée d’Orsay,  museum of Paris, France. It is housed in the former Orsay Railway Station (Gare d’Orsay), a large, ornate structure built in the Beaux Arts style and completed in 1900; it sits on the Left Bank of the Seine River opposite the Tuileries. The luxurious railway station was largely vacant by the 1970s owing to the decline in train travel. With government funds, the building was restored and remodeled in the early 1980s and opened in 1986 as a museum housing a comprehensive selection of mid- and late 19th-century French painting, sculpture, photography, and decorative arts. The Orsay Museum holds the Impressionist paintings that were formerly at the Jeu de Paume Museum, the Post-Impressionist works that were formerly at the Palais de Tokyo, and selected paintings that were at the Louvre Museum. A comprehensive collection of 19th-century French academic painting and sculpture complements works by the better-known artists of the late Romantic and Neoclassical, Realist, Barbizon, Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, Divisionist, and Nabi schools.
