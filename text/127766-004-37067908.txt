Herbert Osborne Yardley,  (born April 13, 1889, Worthington, Ind., U.S.—died  Aug. 7, 1958, Washington, D.C.) American cryptographer who organized and directed the U.S. government’s first formal code-breaking efforts during and after World War I.
As a young man Yardley displayed a marked talent for mathematics and began a lifelong fascination with the game of poker. At 23 he entered the U.S. State Department as a coding clerk and, discovering a remarkable aptitude for cryptology, was soon making recommendations to improve and protect government codes. In 1917 he was put in charge of MI8, the code-breaking section of the Military Intelligence Division (MID). After World War I he proposed that a permanent organization be created “for code and cipher investigation and attack.” In 1919 a joint body, funded by the State Department and the military, was established in New York City with Yardley in charge. He was assisted in this and later cryptographic activities by Edna Ramsaier (1903/04–90), whom he married in 1944. In 1921 this group broke the Japanese diplomatic code and provided information that the State Department used to advantage during the Washington Naval Disarmament Conference. Over the next several years the group suffered from the indifference and even hostility of public officials, culminating in Secretary of State Henry Stimson’s dictum that “Gentlemen do not read each other’s mail.” The group was disbanded, and Yardley, unable to find employment, published in 1931 a best-seller entitled The American Black Chamber, describing in detail the workings of the code group. As a result 19 nations changed their diplomatic codes. In 1938 the Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek engaged Yardley to break the codes of the Japanese armies, which were then invading China. He remained there until 1940, when he went to Canada to set up a cryptology service. Yardley also wrote The Education of a Poker Player (1957).
