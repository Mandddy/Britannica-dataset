Henry Flood,  (born 1732—died Dec. 2, 1791, Farmley, County Kilkenny, Ire.) Anglo-Irish statesman, founder of the Patriot movement that in 1782 won legislative independence for Ireland.
The illegitimate son of Warden Flood, chief justice of the Court of King’s Bench in Ireland, Henry entered the Irish Parliament in 1759. Irish Protestants were becoming impatient with the British Parliament’s right to legislate for Ireland over the wishes of the Irish Parliament. Moreover, the British government controlled a majority in Ireland’s House of Commons through the distribution of crown patronage by the owners of parliamentary boroughs. Flood’s outstanding oratorical powers soon enabled him to create a small but effective opposition inside the Irish Parliament that agitated for political reforms. They demanded provisions for new Irish parliamentary elections every eight years (instead of merely at the start of a new British king’s reign). Their long-range goal was legislative independence. In 1768 Flood’s Patriots engineered passage of a bill limiting the duration of Parliament to eight years, and in 1769 and 1771 they defeated measures to grant funds for the British administration in Ireland.
