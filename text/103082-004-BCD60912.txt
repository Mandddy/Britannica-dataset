Black Entertainment Television (BET), American cable television network and multimedia group providing news, entertainment, and other programming developed primarily for African American viewers. BET also operates a jazz network, BET Jazz, features contemporary music through BET Gospel and BET Hip-Hop, produces documentaries and movies for distribution on the BET channel, and sponsors the BET Awards. The company’s headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
BET was launched in 1980 by media entrepreneur Robert L. Johnson. Having gained experience as a lobbyist for the cable television industry in the late 1970s, Johnson saw an opportunity to reach African American audiences through a cable TV channel. BET originated with two hours of weekly programming in 1980 and slowly gained viewership throughout North America and the Caribbean. Music videos were an early staple of BET programming, as were shows that targeted a youthful audience, but the network broadened its focus to include political and issue-oriented programs, comedy showcases, talk shows, and sports, among a wide variety of offerings. Having established BET as a successful niche media company, Johnson launched it as a public corporation in 1991. BET was listed on the New York Stock Exchange until 1998, when Johnson and other investors gained private control of the firm. In 2000 Johnson and his partners sold BET to Viacom Inc. for $3 billion. The network reaches about 70 million households. BET’s affiliated businesses include book publishing and event production.
