Adam Sedgwick,  (born Sept. 28, 1854, Norwich, Norfolk, Eng.—died  Feb. 27, 1913, London) English zoologist who is best known for his researches on the wormlike organism Peripatus, which he recognized as the zoologically important connecting link between the Annelida, or segmented worms, and the Arthropoda, such as crabs, spiders, and insects.
A grandnephew of the geologist Adam Sedgwick, he was educated at King’s College, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1878 he became a lecturer in the school for zoological research directed by Francis Maitland Balfour, who was a leader of research in comparative anatomy and embryology. After Balfour’s death in 1882 Sedgwick took charge of the school. In 1897 Sedgwick received a fellowship and tutorship at Trinity College, and two years later succeeded Alfred Newton as professor of zoology at Cambridge. He became professor of zoology at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, South Kensington, in 1909. He was the author, and subsequently the editor, of A Student’s Text-Book of Zoology, 3 vol. (1898, 1905, 1909).
