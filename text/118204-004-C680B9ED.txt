Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), also spelled choke cherry ,  deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae), native to North America. It is aptly named for the astringent, acidic taste of its reddish cherries, which may be made into jelly and preserves. The stones and foliage are poisonous and may contain hydrocyanic acid in varying amounts.
Chokecherries often form dense thickets on moist soils and are frequently attacked and defoliated by eastern tent caterpillars (Malacosoma americanum). The plant grows to a height of 6 metres (20 feet), producing hanging spikes of disagreeably scented white flowers. The slender brown twigs also have an unpleasant odour and a bitter taste. The bark is brown or gray, smooth on new growth but becoming scaly with age.
