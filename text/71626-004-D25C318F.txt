Elmer Gantry, American film drama, released in 1960, that was an adaptation of Sinclair Lewisâ€™s novel of the same name and featured Academy Award-winning performances by Burt Lancaster and Shirley Jones.
Lancaster portrayed the title character, a charlatan evangelist who joins a ministry headed by Sister Sharon Falconer (played by Jean Simmons). He mesmerizes his flock even as he fleeces them to pay for his life of hidden lust and avarice. However, his newfound respectability is threatened by a good-girl-turned-prostitute (played by Shirley Jones), who was seduced by Gantry when she was a teenager and is now determined to exact revenge.
