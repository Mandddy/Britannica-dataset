Blood analysis, laboratory examination of a sample of blood used to obtain information about its physical and chemical properties. Blood analysis is commonly carried out on a sample of blood drawn from the vein of the arm, the finger, or the earlobe; in some cases, the blood cells of the bone marrow may also be examined. Hundreds of hematological tests and procedures have been developed, and many can be carried out simultaneously on one sample of blood with such instruments as autoanalyzers.
Blood is composed of plasma and blood cells. The blood cells—erythrocytes (red blood cells), leukocytes (white blood cells), and thrombocytes (platelets)—are suspended in the plasma with other particulate matter. Plasma is a clear straw-coloured fluid that makes up more than half the volume of blood. It is distinguished from serum, the clear cell-free fluid in which fibrinogen, a soluble protein normally found in the plasma, has been converted to fibrin, an insoluble clotting protein, and from which fibrin and other clotting proteins have been removed. Serum is formed when the plasma or whole blood is allowed to clot. Centrifugation can be used to separate the plasma or serum from blood samples. Tests to measure the concentration of substances in the blood may use plasma, serum, or whole blood that has been anticoagulated to keep all the contents in suspension.
