Alexander Lange Kielland,  (born February 18, 1849, Stavanger, Norway—died April 6, 1906, Bergen) novelist, short-story writer, and dramatist, one of the “big four” (with Henrik Ibsen, B.M. Bjørnson, and Jonas Lie) of 19th-century Norwegian literature.
The scion of an aristocratic family, Kielland took a law degree in 1871 and purchased a brickyard, which he managed for nine years. Discontented, he went to Paris in 1878 and the next year published a collection of his short stories. Kielland had read widely in the literature of 19th-century liberalism, notably John Stuart Mill and Georg Brandes, and he dedicated his creative energies to social criticism and reform.
