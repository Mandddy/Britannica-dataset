Yanni, in full Yanni Chryssomallis  (born November 14, 1954, Kalamata, Greece) Greek-born American composer and keyboardist who was a leading figure in late 20th-century New Age music—a characteristically nonarousing genre of popular music, often entirely instrumental and used for relaxation or meditation.
Yanni Chryssomallis was born into a middle-class family in Greece, and during his childhood his parents encouraged—but by no means pressured—him to play music. At the time, he simply enjoyed making music, never imagining that he would ultimately pursue it as a career. As an adolescent, he was a member of the Greek national swimming team, breaking the national freestyle record at age 14. He went to the United States at age 18 to attend the University of Minnesota, from which he graduated in 1976 with a degree in psychology. It was only after his graduation that he began to focus on music.
