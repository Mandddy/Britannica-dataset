Butternut,  (Juglans cinerea), deciduous nut-producing tree of the walnut family (Juglandaceae), native to eastern North America. A mature tree has gray, deeply furrowed bark and is about 15 to 18 m (50 to 60 feet) tall and 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 inches) in diameter. Each leaf, about 45 to 75 cm long, has 11 to 17 yellowish green leaflets that are hairy underneath. Chocolate-coloured partitions divide the pith of the twig into many chambers. The egg-shaped fruit has a sticky, greenish brown husk. The hard, woody nut bears many ridges and contains a sweet, oily seed. The tree is economically important for its edible nuts and for a yellow or orange dye obtained from the fruit husks. Some substances in the inner bark of the roots are used in medicines.
