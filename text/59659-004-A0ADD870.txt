The Big Sleep, American film noir, released in 1946, that was based on Raymond Chandler’s classic 1939 novel of the same name. It was directed by Howard Hawks, cowritten by author William Faulkner, and starred the popular team of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. Although its plot is often cited as one of the most baffling in film history, The Big Sleep was deemed culturally significant by the Library of Congress and was added to the National Film Registry in 1997.
Philip Marlowe, the cynical private detective portrayed by Bogart, is hired by the wealthy General Sternwood (played by Charles Waldron) to investigate the person who has been blackmailing him over the gambling debts of his promiscuous but childish daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers). Marlowe is also tasked with finding out what happened to Sean Regan, a friend of the family who investigated a previous blackmailing. While keeping an eye on Carmen, Marlowe falls in love with her protective and mysterious older sister, Vivian (Bacall), and becomes embroiled in a whole host of criminality involving killers, blackmailers, gamblers, and pornographers. Unlike most detective films, the plot focuses on the criminal investigation rather than on solving the crime. At one point during production, the actors, director, and screenwriters were so confused by the plot—especially whether the death of the family chauffeur was a murder or a suicide—Hawks sent a telegram to Chandler asking for help. As the novelist later admitted, “I didn’t know either.”
