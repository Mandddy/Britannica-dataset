Michel Colombe,  (born c. 1430, Brittany [France]—died c. 1512, Tours, France) the last important Gothic sculptor in France. Little is known of his life, and none of his early works survives.
His masterpiece is the tomb (1502–07) of Francis II of Brittany and his consort, Marguerite of Foix, in the Cathedral of Nantes. The general design of the tomb was the work of the sculptor Jean Perréal, but Colombe executed the work. The reclining effigies and the figures of the four virtues on the corners of the tomb show little influence of the Burgundian Gothic style or of the art of the Italian Renaissance. Instead, they stem from the serene late Gothic art produced in the Loire River valley of France.
