Prau,  fast, sharp-ended rowing or sailing boat that is widely used in Malayan waters and was once popular with Malayan pirates. The prau is long and narrow, rigged with one or two fore-and-aft sails. Modern praus are generally open and relatively small. In earlier times the boats were decked and measured as much as 60 feet (18 m) long.
