Oscar de la Renta, in full Oscar Aristides Ortiz de la Renta Fiallo  (born July 22, 1932, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic—died October 20, 2014, Kent, Connecticut, U.S.) Dominican-born American fashion designer whose work, blending European luxury with American ease, helped define standards of elegant dressing among socialites, U.S. first ladies, and red-carpet celebrities during a career that spanned some 50 years.
De la Renta received an international fashion education. At 18 he left the Dominican Republic to study painting at the San Fernando Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid. There, he began working as an illustrator for fashion houses, a position that led eventually to the post of assisting Spain’s leading designer, Cristóbal Balenciaga. In 1961 de la Renta settled in Paris, where he worked as the assistant to Lanvin-Castillo’s head designer, Antonio del Castillo, before moving to New York City in 1963 to design the couture and ready-to-wear collections for Elizabeth Arden. In 1965 he established his own eponymous company in New York.
