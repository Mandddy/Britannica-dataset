Clutha River,  river, the longest in South Island, New Zealand. Rising in the Southern Alps, 210 miles (340 km) from the sea, the stream issues from Lake Wanaka and, fed by the Pomahaka, Lindis, and Manuherikia rivers, flows southeast through a narrow gorge. It drains a basin some 8,480 square miles (21,960 square km) in area and has a mean annual discharge of 23,000 cubic feet (650 cubic m) per second. Ten miles (16 km) from the Pacific, the river splits to flow around Inch Clutha Island and enters the ocean by two mouths. Major settlements of the valley, which supports sheep, beef, grain, and fruit farming in the upper reaches and vegetable and dairy farming in the delta, include Clyde, Cromwell, Alexandra, Balclutha, and Kaitangata. At the limit of navigation (45 miles [72 km] upstream) is the large Roxburgh hydroelectric station and its 20-mile- [32-kilometre-] long storage reservoir. The riverâ€™s name is derived from the Gaelic for Clyde River. It was the site of gold placer mining during the 1860s.
