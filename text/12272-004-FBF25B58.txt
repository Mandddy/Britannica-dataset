Dory, also called John Dory,  any of several marine fishes of the family Zeidae (order Zeiformes), found worldwide in moderately deep waters. The members of the family are large-mouthed fish, deep-bodied but thin from side to side.
The John Dory (Zenopsis conchifera), a food fish of the Atlantic and Mediterranean, is one of the better-known species. It ranges from the shore to waters about 200 m (650 feet) deep and reaches a maximum length of about 90 cm (3 feet). Grayish, with a distinctive, yellow-ringed black spot on each side, it has long pelvic fins, long, filamentous dorsal-fin spines, and rows of spines on the belly and at the bases of the dorsal and anal fins. A similar species, Z. japonicus, is found in the Pacific.
