I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, American dramatic film, released in 1932, that was an exposé on the life of inmates on chain gangs. It awoke social interest in and helped bring an end to the widespread use of chain gangs in the American South.
James Allen (played by Paul Muni) is an impoverished World War I veteran who is forced at gunpoint to participate in a crime. He is caught and sentenced to a chain gang in Georgia. After enduring much brutality, he escapes and becomes a successful engineer and builder. When his landlady, Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell), discovers his secret, she threatens to reveal his true identity unless he marries her. Allen later falls in love with Helen (Helen Vinson) and tells Marie he wants a divorce. She responds by turning him over to the authorities. After staging another escape, Allen goes to Helen to say goodbye. When she questions how he lives, he responds, “I steal.”
