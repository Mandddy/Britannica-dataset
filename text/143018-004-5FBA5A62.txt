Silky terrier, Australian breed of toy dog, first shown in 1907. It originated in Sydney and was once known as the Sydney silky. A rather low-set dog, the silky terrier stands 9 to 10 inches (23 to 25.5 cm) and weighs 8 to 10 pounds (3.5 to 4.5 kg). Its silky, fine coat is glossy blue-gray and tan, with a silver-gray or tan topknot. Developed as a companion dog, the silky is generally friendly and responsive, with the terrier-like alertness prescribed in the breed standard of perfection.
