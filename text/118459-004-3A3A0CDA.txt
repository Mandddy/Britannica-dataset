International Telecommunication Union (ITU), specialized agency of the United Nations that was created to encourage international cooperation in all forms of telecommunication. Its activities include maintaining order in the allocation of radio frequencies, setting standards on technical and operational matters, and assisting countries in developing their own telecommunication systems.
The origin of the ITU can be traced to 1865, when the International Telegraph Union was established by a convention signed in Paris. The International Telecommunication Convention of 1932, which merged the International Telegraph Convention and the International Radiotelegraph Convention, provided that the International Telecommunication Union would succeed the International Telegraph Union when the convention became effective in 1934. It was made a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1947, and the convention has been revised several times.
