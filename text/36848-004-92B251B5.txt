Michael II,  (born , Amorium, Diocese of Asiaâ€”died  Oct. 2, 829) Byzantine emperor and founder of the Amorian dynasty who attempted to moderate the Iconoclastic controversy that divided 9th-century Byzantium.
Rising from humble origins, Michael became a military commander. He was a comrade-in-arms of Leo the Armenian, who later became Emperor Leo V (813). When, in 803, Bardanes Turcus and Nicephorus I were fighting over the imperial throne, Leo and Michael at first supported Bardanes but later deserted him and joined the cause of Nicephorus. Years later, after Leo had ascended the throne, Michael incurred the suspicion of his former friend and was imprisoned on a charge of treason. On Dec. 24, 820, he was sentenced to death, but on the following day, his partisans assassinated Leo and proclaimed Michael emperor.
