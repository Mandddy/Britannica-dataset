Jules Hardouin-Mansart,  (born c. April 16, 1646, Paris, France—died May 11, 1708, Marly-le-Roi) French architect and city planner to King Louis XIV who completed the design of Versailles.
Mansart in 1668 adopted the surname of his granduncle by marriage, the distinguished architect François Mansart. By 1674, when he was commissioned to rebuild the château of Clagny for Louis XIV’s mistress Madame de Montespan, he was already launched on a brilliant career. Among his earlier achievements were many private houses, including his own, the Hôtel de Lorges, later the Hôtel de Conti.
