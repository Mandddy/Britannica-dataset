Kepler, U.S. satellite designed to detect extrasolar planets by watching—from orbit around the Sun—for a slight dimming during transits as these bodies pass in front of their stars. An important objective of Kepler’s mission was to determine the percentage of planets that are in or near their stars’ habitable zones—that is, the distances from the stars at which liquid water, and therefore possibly life, could exist.
Detecting the transit of an extrasolar planet is very challenging. For example, the diameter of Earth is only 1/109 that of the Sun, so that, for an outside observer of the solar system, the passage of Earth would dim the output of the Sun by only 0.008 percent. In addition, a planet’s orbital plane must be aligned to pass in front of the star. Continuous observation without atmospheric distortion or day-night cycles—not possible from Earth—is essential to the mission. Kepler was placed in a heliocentric orbit with a 372.5-day period so it gradually trails Earth, thus avoiding effects from the magnetosphere that might interfere with the mission.
