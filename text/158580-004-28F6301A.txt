Polybius,  (born  c. 200 bce, Megalopolis, Arcadia, Greeceâ€”died c. 118) Greek statesman and historian who wrote of the rise of Rome to world prominence.
Polybius was the son of Lycortas, a distinguished Achaean statesman, and he received the upbringing considered appropriate for a son of rich landowners. His youthful biography of Philopoemen reflected his admiration for that great Achaean leader, and an interest in military matters found expression in his lost book, Tactics. He enjoyed riding and hunting, but his knowledge of literature was rather specialized (apart from the historians) and his acquaintance with philosophy superficial.
