Jonathan Demme, original name Robert Jonathan Demme  (born February 22, 1944, Baldwin, New York, U.S.) American film director known for his eclectic body of work, which ranged from feature films to concert movies to documentaries.
Demme’s first foray into the world of movies was as a film critic for the student paper at the University of Florida in Gainesville in the 1960s. Demme ended up dropping out of school, but he soon found further work reviewing films. Eventually Demme’s father, who worked in public relations, introduced his son to the producer Joseph E. Levine, who liked Demme’s writing and offered him a place in the publicity department of his production company. Publicity work for several other film companies followed, and eventually Demme became a publicist for producer and director Roger Corman.
