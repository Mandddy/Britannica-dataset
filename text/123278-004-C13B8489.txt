Gordon setter, breed of sporting dog dating from 17th-century Scotland, named for the duke of Gordon, whose kennels brought the breed to prominence. Like the other setters, its function is to search for game and indicate its presence to the hunter. The Gordon setter stands 23 to 27 inches (58 to 69 cm) and weighs 45 to 80 pounds (20 to 36 kg). Its soft, wavy coat is black with tan on the head, throat, chest, and legs. Noted for its appearance, loyalty, and lively temperament, the Gordon setter is generally methodical in the field.
