Bernardo Bertolucci,  (born March 16, 1940, Parma, Italy) Italian film director who was perhaps best known for his film Last Tango in Paris (1972), the erotic content of which created an international sensation.
Bertolucci was raised in an atmosphere of comfort and intellectualism. His father—a poet, anthologist, teacher of art history, and film critic—was a strong early influence. Bertolucci’s early childhood interest in films came as a result of attending frequent screenings with his father. His first two films, shorts about children, were filmed when Bertolucci was 15 years old. His first book, In cerca del mistero (1962; “In Search of Mystery”), won the Premio Viareggio, one of Italy’s top literary awards. A short time later he embarked on his film career as assistant director to Pier Paolo Pasolini. After his work on Pasolini’s Accattone (1961), Bertolucci left the University of Rome without graduating and set off on an independent study of film.
