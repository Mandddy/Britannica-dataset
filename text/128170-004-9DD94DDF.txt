Staghorn fern (genus Platycerium), member of the genus Platycerium (family Polypodiaceae), which is bizarre in appearance and frequently displayed in conservatories and other collections. Platycerium (17 species of Africa, Asia, and South America) is epiphyticâ€”i.e., the plants grow upon other plants. The leaves are of two forms; one type is elongated, erect or pendulous, and repeatedly forked, hence the name staghorn. The other leaf type is flat or bowl-shaped and grows closely appressed to the support on which the plant lives. Termed mantle leaves, these provide in some species a kind of bowl in which humus collects and roots develop and absorb moisture and nutrients. The spore-producing structures (sporangia) are variously disposed in large patches on the lower sides of the elongated leaves according to species.
