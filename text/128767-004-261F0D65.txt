Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov,  (born January 12, 1903, Sim, Russia—died February 7, 1960, Moscow) Soviet nuclear physicist who guided the development of his country’s first atomic bomb, first practical thermonuclear bomb, and first nuclear reactor.
Kurchatov’s father was a surveyor and his mother a teacher. In 1912 the family moved to Simferopol in Crimea. In 1920 Kurchatov entered Simferopol State University, from which he graduated three years later with a degree in physics. In 1925 he was invited to join A.F. Ioffe’s Physico-Technical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). Kurchatov’s initial studies concerned what is now called ferroelectricity. In 1933 he shifted his research interests to the maturing field of nuclear physics, familiarizing himself with the literature and conducting experiments. With his colleagues, he published papers on radioactivity and supervised the construction of the first Soviet cyclotrons.
