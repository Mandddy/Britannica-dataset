Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis), one of three Asian species of rhinoceros and the smallest living rhinoceros. Both females and males typically weigh less than 850 kg (1,870 pounds); they are 2.5 metres (8 feet) long and 1.5 metres (5 feet) high at the shoulder. Sumatran rhinoceroses are the most ancient of the five rhinoceros species and the most unusual in that they are covered in long body hair. This species was originally found from Assam throughout Myanmar (Burma), much of Thailand, Indochina (Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam), Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo. Today the Sumatran rhinoceros numbers no more than 100 individuals in the wild, scattered among a few protected areas in Sumatra. Fewer than two dozen have been placed in captivity, distributed among zoos in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United States.
The Sumatran rhinoceros inhabits forests, marshy areas, and regions of thick bush and bamboo. It is an active climber in mountainous country. It is mainly a browser and often feeds on pioneer plants that dominate in gaps in the forest created by fallen trees.
