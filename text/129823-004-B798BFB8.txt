J.J. Abrams, byname of Jeffrey Jacob Abrams  (born June 27, 1966, New York City, New York, U.S.) American writer, director, and producer who was known for his role in creating several hit television series, including Lost (2004–10), and for his blockbuster action and science-fiction movies.
Abrams’s father was a producer of made-for-television movies, and the younger Abrams followed him into the entertainment industry at an early age by making short Super-8 movies as a boy. Abrams got his first job in the film industry at age 16, when he scored the low-budget science-fiction film Nightbeast (1982). Soon after graduating (1988) from Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York, he cowrote (with Jill Mazursky) the screenplay for the comedy Taking Care of Business (1990). While the movie was not a success, Abrams nevertheless had his foot in the filmmaking door, and he penned the script for the 1991 drama Regarding Henry (for which he also received coproducer credit). He then wrote Forever Young (1992), which he followed by cowriting two critically panned movies: Gone Fishin’ (1997) and Armageddon (1998).
