Sussex spaniel, breed of sporting dog developed in Great Britain in the late 18th century; like other land spaniels, it flushes game from cover and retrieves it. Its earliest proponent had his seat in the county of Sussex, giving the breed its name. Hound ancestry is suggested by the Sussex spanielâ€™s long ears, loose skin, heavy build, and tendency to give tongue when tracking. Its flat, feathered coat is a unique shade of brown described as golden liver. It stands 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm) and weighs 35 to 45 pounds (16 to 20 kg). Although valued as a slow but sturdy worker since its introduction, the breed has never been numerous and was saved from extinction during World War II by a single breeder. In 1884 it was one of the first 10 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.
