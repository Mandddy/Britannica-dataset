Meroe, city of ancient Cush (Kush) the ruins of which are located on the east bank of the Nile about 4 miles (6.4 km) north of Kabūshīyah in the present-day Sudan; Meroe is also the name of the area surrounding the city.
The 25th, or “Ethiopian,” dynasty of ancient Egypt is believed to have retired to Cush after 656 bc and established itself at Meroe, where it fostered an Egypto-Cushite culture that through the subsequent 1,000 years became increasingly cut off from its source. Meroe was the southern administrative centre for the kingdom of Cush, beginning about 750 bc, at a time when Napata was still its capital. After the sack of Napata in about 590 by the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik II, Meroe became the capital of the kingdom and developed into a wide and prosperous area. It survived a Roman invasion—though its status was lowered thereby—but it later declined in the face of raiding tribes, to fall at the more determined invasions of the Aksumite armies, probably under Ella-Amida, whose reign ended between about ad 320 and 325.
