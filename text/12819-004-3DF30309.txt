Clipper ship,  classic sailing ship of the 19th century, renowned for its beauty, grace, and speed. Apparently starting from the small, swift coastal packet known as the Baltimore clipper, the true clipper evolved first in American and later in British yards. In its ultimate form it was a long, slim, graceful vessel with projecting bow and radically streamlined hull, carrying an exceptionally large spread of sail on three tall masts. The emphasis on speed came partly from the desire to bring the first tea of the season back from China, partly from the competition with the overland route across North America to the California goldfields. The Flying Cloud, launched in 1851, made the voyage from New York City to San Francisco in a record 89 days, and the James Baines set the transatlantic sailing record of 12 days 6 h from Boston to Liverpool, Eng. The Lightning set the all-time record for a single dayâ€™s sail, covering 436 nautical miles in 24 h. The Lightning and the James Baines (both launched in 1854 or 1855), as well as the Flying Cloud, were built by Donald McKay, a Canadian-born shipbuilder, at his shipyard at East Boston, Mass.
