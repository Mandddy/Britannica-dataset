Evel Knievel, original name Robert Craig Knievel  (born October 17, 1938, Butte, Montana, U.S.—died November 30, 2007, Clearwater, Florida) American motorcycle daredevil who captivated audiences with his death-defying stunts.
As a youth, Knievel was often jailed for stealing hubcaps and motorcycles, including a Harley-Davidson motorcycle at age 13. His brushes with the law led to a popular belief that the police gave him the nickname “Evil Knievel,” which he later modified to “Evel” and took as his legal name. After dropping out of high school, Knievel took several odd jobs that included working in the copper mines of Butte, Montana, where he caused a power outage by crashing an earthmover into the city’s main power line while attempting to do wheelies.
