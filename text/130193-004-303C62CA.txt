Abscess,  a localized collection of pus in a cavity formed from tissues that have been broken down by infectious bacteria. An abscess is caused when such bacteria as staphylococci or streptococci gain access to solid tissue (e.g., by means of a small wound on the skin). The toxins released by these multiplying bacteria destroy cells and thus trigger an acute inflammation at the site, with its characteristic signs of redness, pain, swelling, and heat. (See inflammation.) White blood cells (leukocytes) collect at the site; these leukocytes break down the dead tissues and absorb the bacteria by means of phagocytosis. Thick yellowish pus is formed from the broken-down tissues, the dead bacteria and leukocytes, and the extracellular fluid that has accumulated. At the same time, nearby healthy cells form a capsule of tissue around the pus and develop a cell wall that delimits the abscess from nearby healthy tissues. When the abscess is ruptured, either naturally or through medical intervention, the pus escapes, the swelling and pain are relieved, and the delimiting cell wall eventually grows back into the abscess cavity.
Abscesses may occur on the skin surface or within the body on such internal organs as the lungs, brain, kidneys, or tonsils. Treatment for those abscesses that do not naturally resolve themselves consists of cutting into the capsule and draining its pus contents. Antibiotics are also administered to help fight the infection. Antihistamines may be prescribed to reduce swelling. Care must be taken to prevent the pus and other infective contents from entering the bloodstream and thus being carried to surrounding tissues, where they can result in new abscesses. See also boil.
