Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible as interpreted among the various branches of Christianity. In Judaism the Hebrew Bible is not only the primary text of instruction for a moral life but also the historical record of Godâ€™s promise, first articulated in his covenant with Abraham, to consider the Jews as Israel, his chosen people. Christians, on the other hand, view it as the prophecy of the advent of Jesus Christ as the Messiah, the redeemer of humanity, in fulfillment of that promise. Thus, Christian tradition employs the Hebrew Scriptures to legitimize the gospel of Jesus in the New Testament as the natural extension of the Abrahamic covenant. The Old Testament, a name coined by Melito of Sardis in the 2nd century ad, is longer than the Hebrew Bible, in part because Christian editors divided particular works into two sections but also because different Christian groups consider as canonical some texts not found in the Hebrew Bible. For further discussion of both Jewish and Christian attitudes toward the Hebrew Scriptures, see Hebrew Bible. For full treatment, see biblical literature.
