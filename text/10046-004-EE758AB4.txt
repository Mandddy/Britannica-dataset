John McGraw, in full John Joseph McGraw, byname Little Napoleon  (born April 7, 1873, Truxton, New York, U.S.â€”died February 25, 1934, New Rochelle, New York) American professional baseball player and manager who led the New York Giants to 10 National League championships.
During the 1890s McGraw was a star infielder for the Baltimore National League club. (Both the American and the National League Baltimore teams of this era were named the Orioles; neither team, however, was affiliated with the current American League Orioles, who took that name upon moving from St. Louis, Missouri, in 1954.) His .391 mark of 1899 remains the highest batting average attained by any major league third baseman.
