Émile Roux, in full Pierre-Paul-Émile Roux  (born Dec. 17, 1853, Confolens, Charente, France—died Nov. 3, 1933, Paris) French bacteriologist noted for his work on diphtheria and tetanus and for his collaboration with Louis Pasteur in the development of vaccines.
Roux began his medical studies at the University of Clermont-Ferrand. In 1878 he was accepted into Pasteur’s laboratory at the University of Paris and spent 10 years there, completing his medical degree in 1881. During that period his work was integral to the development of methods used in preparing vaccines for diseases such as fowl cholera, anthrax, and rabies. In 1888 Roux joined the newly created Pasteur Institute, where, with Alexandre Yersin, he demonstrated that the symptoms of diphtheria are caused by a toxin secreted by the diphtheria bacillus (a bacterium). That discovery, together with the subsequent finding by bacteriologists Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo that infection with the diphtheria bacillus elicits the production of an antitoxin (antibody), led to the development of diphtheria immunization and serum therapy. Roux became director of the Pasteur Institute in 1904, a post he held until his death in 1933.
