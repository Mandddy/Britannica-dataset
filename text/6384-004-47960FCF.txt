Bedlington terrier, breed of dog developed in the 1800s in Northumberland, England, and named for Bedlingtonshire, a mining district in the area. The breed, which established itself locally as a fighting dog and a courageous hunter of badgers and other vermin, was later popular as a pet. Lamblike in appearance, the Bedlington terrier has an arched back, a topknot, and a thick, curly coat, linty in texture and blue-gray, deep reddish brown, or pale sandy, often with tan markings. It stands about 15 to 17 inches (38 to 43 cm) and weighs 17 to 23 pounds (8 to 10 kg).
