Flatbed press,  printing press employing a flat surface for the type or plates against which paper is pressed, either by another flat surface acting reciprocally against it or by a cylinder rolling over it. It may be contrasted to the rotary press, which has a cylindrical printing surface. The first cylinder flatbed press was built by Friedrich Koenig of Germany and used by The Times of London in 1814.
In the platen press, a flat surface bearing the paper is pressed against the flat, inked printing plate; the two surfaces come together and part with a jawlike motion. Most small hand presses are platen presses. Both cylinder and platen types of flatbed presses operate at speeds of 1,000 to 4,000 impressions per hour.
