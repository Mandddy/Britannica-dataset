Constantine P. Cavafy, English in full Constantine Petrou Cavafy, pseudonym of Konstantínos Pétrou Kaváfis  (born April 29, 1863, Alexandria, Egypt—died April 29, 1933, Alexandria) Greek poet who developed his own consciously individual style and thus became one of the most important figures not only in Greek poetry but in Western poetry as well. He lived most of his life in Alexandria, Egypt, loved English and French literature, and generally spoke English; even his Greek had a British accent.
Cavafy’s parents were both from the Greek community in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). His father, a merchant in the import-export business, worked in Constantinople and England, establishing a firm with his brother George, The family eventually settled in Alexandria, where Constantine was born. Cavafy’s father died suddenly in 1870, and two years later Cavafy’s mother moved with her sons to England. The branch offices that had been established in Liverpool and London declined and failed, and after some seven years most of the family returned to Alexandria. They were once again uprooted in 1882, when the British bombarded the city and then occupied it.
