Mooneye, also called toothed herring,  North American freshwater fish of the family Hiodontidae. The mooneye is a spirited catch but is not greatly valued as food. Mooneyes are herring-like in appearance, with sharp teeth, large eyes, and deeply forked tail fins. Those of the species Hiodon tergisus are bright silvery fish and may be about 42.5 centimetres (17 inches) long. The goldeye, H. (sometimes called Amphiodon) alosoides, is blue-backed, silvery, and grows to about 25 cm; the southern mooneye (H. selenops) is a silvery fish growing to about 30 cm.
