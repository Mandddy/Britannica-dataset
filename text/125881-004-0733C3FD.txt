Bagel, doughnut-shaped yeast-leavened roll that is characterized by a crisp, shiny crust and a dense interior. Long regarded as a Jewish specialty item, the bagel is commonly eaten as a breakfast food or snack, often with toppings such as cream cheese and lox (smoked salmon).
Bagels are made from the basic bread ingredients of flour, yeast, salt, and sweetening. High-gluten flour gives the roll its spongy, chewy texture, which can be lightened by the addition of eggs, milk, and butter. As traditionally made, the dough is shaped by hand into a ring, boiled for a short time in water to seal the dough to ensure a compact texture, and then baked. In modern mass production, the rings are machine-made, and steaming may be substituted for boiling. In either process, a glaze of egg yolk or milk applied before baking produces a shiny crust. Seeds and spices may be added before baking; bagels also are made with flavourings, vegetables, nuts, or fruits mixed into the dough, although purists scorn such innovations. There are also whole-grain and rye versions.
