François Maynard,  Maynard also spelled Mainard   (born 1582/83, Toulouse, Fr.—died  Dec. 28, 1646) French poet, leading disciple of François de Malherbe and, like him, concerned with the clarification of the French language. He is commonly confused with François Ménard (1589–1631) of Nîmes, also a poet.
Maynard obtained a post with Marguerite de Valois in 1605 and began writing pastoral poetry. Philandre belongs to this period, although it was not printed until 1619. He attached himself to Malherbe and helped to spread the latter’s ideas on the necessity of a standard grammar, the elimination of personal sentiments in writing, and an objective treatment of the subject matter.
