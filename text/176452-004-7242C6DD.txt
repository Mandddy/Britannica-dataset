Sands of Iwo Jima, American war film, released in 1949, that depicts the hard-fought U.S. victory over the Japanese at the Battle of Iwo Jima in February 1945.
The film centres on a squad of U.S. Marines during World War II. The young recruits are led by Sgt. John M. Stryker (played by John Wayne), a rough disciplinarian who is initially despised by his men. Particularly resentful are Pvt. Al Thomas (Forrest Tucker), whose irresponsibility costs a soldier his life, and Pvt. Peter Conway (John Agar), a cocky college graduate who considers Stryker cruel and inhuman for failing to rescue a wounded soldier during the Battle of Tarawa—not realizing that such an attempt would have given away the position of the entire squadron and put all of the men at risk. As the fighting continues, however, the soldiers begin to develop respect for Stryker and for his rigorous training. At one point, Stryker saves Conway’s life when a live grenade is accidentally dropped, earning him the young soldier’s admiration and gratitude. The squadron then fights at the Battle of Iwo Jima and witnesses the historic raising of the American flag on Mount Suribachi. Later, however, Stryker is killed by a sniper.
