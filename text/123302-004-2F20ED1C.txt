Since the time of the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce), the lower Liao River basin has been known as the Chinese Pale, an area settled chiefly by Han Chinese immigrants from what are now the provinces of Hebei and Shandong. During the Xi (Western) Han period, a county called Houcheng was set up in the area of what is now Shenyang. The rest of Manchuria was long under the control of various nomadic and tribal peoples, of whom the Manchu became the most important. In later centuries the Pale was at least symbolically set off from the rest of Manchuria by a discontinuous barrier known as the Willow Palisade.
