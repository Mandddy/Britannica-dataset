Brook Taylor,  (born August 18, 1685, Edmonton, Middlesex, England—died December 29, 1731, London) British mathematician, a proponent of Newtonian mechanics and noted for his contributions to the development of calculus.
Taylor was born into a prosperous and educated family who encouraged the development of his musical and artistic talents, both of which found mathematical expression in his later life. He was tutored at home before he entered St. John’s College, Cambridge, in 1701 to study law. He completed his LL.B. in 1709 and his doctorate in 1714, but it is doubtful that he ever practiced as a lawyer.
