Aqua regia,  mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids, usually one part of the former to three parts of the latter by volume. This mixture was given its name (literally, “royal water”) by the alchemists because of its ability to dissolve gold and other so-called noble metals.
Aqua regia and other mixtures similar to it are used in analytical procedures for the solution of certain iron ores, phosphate rocks, slags, nickel-chromium alloys, antimony, selenium, and some of the less soluble sulfides, such as those of mercury, arsenic, cobalt, and lead.
