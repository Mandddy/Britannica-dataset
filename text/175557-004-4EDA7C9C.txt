Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, large cultural complex (opened 1971) in Washington, D.C., with a total of six stages, designed by Edward Durell Stone. The complex, surfaced in marble, makes use of the ornamental facade screens for which the architect is known. Its three main theatres are entered from the Grand Foyer, which faces the Potomac River. The Concert Hall, the largest auditorium, has been designated a national monument; its acoustics are considered exceptional, and its embossed ceiling and crystal chandeliers have been much admired.
Created by the National Cultural Center Act of 1958, the facility was renamed as a “living memorial” to the assassinated president John F. Kennedy, the first American president to take an active interest in promoting the performing arts. It hosts a variety of theatre, dance, and musical performances, both national and international, and is the home of the National Symphony Orchestra as well as the DeVos Institute of Arts Management. Since 1978 it has been the site of an annual gala at which a number of performers are awarded the Kennedy Center Honors.
