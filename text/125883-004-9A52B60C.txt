Batter, mixture of flour and liquid with other ingredients, such as leavening agents, shortening, sugar, salt, eggs, and various flavouring materials, used to make baked products.
Such mixtures—called doughs—are thick and flexible, allowing them to be shaped and rolled. Batters, however, contain higher proportions of liquids, are thinner than doughs, and can be stirred, poured, and dropped from a spoon. Batter products are mainly shaped by the form of the containers in which they are baked and include biscuits, muffins, scones, corn bread, pancakes, layer cakes, and angel food cakes. Angel food and sponge-cake batters, usually made without leavening ingredients, are leavened during baking by the expansion of the many small air bubbles incorporated in the batter by vigorous mixing or beating. Batters are also used as coatings for foods that are to be sautéed or fried.
