Gene Krupa, in full Eugene Bertram Krupa  (born Jan. 15, 1909, Chicago, Ill., U.S.â€”died  Oct. 16, 1973, Yonkers, N.Y.) American jazz drummer who was perhaps the most popular percussionist of the swing era.
After the death of his father, Krupa went to work at age 11 as an errand boy for a music company. He soon earned enough money to purchase a musical instrument and decided upon a drum set because it was the least expensive instrument in a wholesale catalog. In the early 1920s, Krupa learned from and sometimes jammed with many of the great jazz performers who were then in Chicago, receiving his greatest inspiration from New Orleans drummer Baby Dodds. Immersing himself in the study of jazz, Krupa began to play in several Chicago-area jazz groups with musicians such as Frank Teschmacher, Bix Beiderbecke, and his future employer Benny Goodman.
