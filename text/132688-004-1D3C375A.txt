Jakarta, formerly (until 1949) Batavia or (1949–72) Djakarta,  largest city and capital of Indonesia. Jakarta lies on the northwest coast of Java at the mouth of the Ciliwung (Liwung River) where it meets Jakarta Bay (an embayment of the Java Sea). It is coextensive with the metropolitan district of Greater Jakarta (Jakarta Raya) and nearly coextensive with the daerah khusus ibukota (special capital district) of Jakarta—the latter also including a number of small offshore islands in the Java Sea.
In 1966, when the city was declared a special capital district, it gained a status approximately equivalent to that of a state or province. The city has long been a major trade and financial centre. It has also become an important industrial city and a centre for education. Area special capital district, 255 square miles (661 square km). Pop.
