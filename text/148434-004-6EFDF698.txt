Irish terrier, dog developed in Ireland, one of the oldest breeds of terriers. Nicknamed the “daredevil,” it has earned the reputation of being adaptable, loyal, spirited, and recklessly courageous. It served as a messenger and sentinel dog in World War I, and it has been used to hunt and to retrieve game. The Irish terrier is a sturdily built dog with racier lines than those of other terriers. Its long, relatively narrow head is usually accented by a short beard. It stands about 18 inches (46 cm), weighs 25 to 27 pounds (11 to 12 kg), and is distinguished by its wiry golden-red to reddish brown coat.
