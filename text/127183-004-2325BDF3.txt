Gordon Ramsay,  (born November 8, 1966, Glasgow, Scotland) Scottish chef and restaurateur known for his highly acclaimed restaurants and cookbooks but perhaps best known in the early 21st century for the profanity and fiery temper that he freely displayed on television cooking programs.
As a young boy, Ramsay moved with his family from Scotland to England, where he was raised in Stratford-upon-Avon. He played association football (soccer) for the Oxford United youth team, and at age 15 he was courted by the Scottish Premier League Glasgow Rangers. A knee injury ultimately prevented him from pursuing a career in football.
