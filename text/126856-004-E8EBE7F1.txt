Dame Ninette de Valois, original name Edris Stannus   (born June 6, 1898, Blessington, County Wicklow, Ireland—died March 8, 2001, London, England) Irish-born British dancer, choreographer, and founder of the company that in October 1956 became the Royal Ballet. She was influential in establishing ballet in England.
After study with Enrico Cecchetti and varied experience as a dancer in pantomime, revues, and opera, de Valois joined Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in 1923 as a soloist. At age 26, however, she quit performing after learning she was suffering from an undiagnosed case of childhood polio. In 1926 she founded her own school, the Academy of Choreographic Art, in London. She also produced dances for Lennox Robinson at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin and for Terence Gray at the Festival Theatre in Cambridge.
