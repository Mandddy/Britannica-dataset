Gray seal (Halichoerus grypus), seal of the family Phocidae, found in North Atlantic waters along the coast of Newfoundland, in the British Isles, and in the Baltic region. It is spotted gray and black and is characterized by a robust appearance and heavy head. The male grows to about 3 metres (10 feet) in length and 300 kg (660 pounds) in weight; the female is smaller. Gregarious and rather slow-moving, the gray seal is commonly found near rocks and cliffs. It feeds on fish and breeds in late winter (autumn in Britain), the male gathering a harem of about 10 females. Litters usually contain a single white-coated pup.
