Spoon River, river in west-central Illinois, U.S. It rises at the confluence of the West Fork Spoon and East Fork Spoon rivers in Stark county and flows south and southwest to a point west of Lewistown, where it turns southeast, joining the Illinois River opposite Havana after a course of about 160 miles (260 km). It drains an area of some 1,850 square miles (4,800 square km). Spoon River was made famous by the poet Edgar Lee Masters, whose Spoon River Anthology (1915) details the frustrated ambitions of people who lived in the fictitious town of Spoon River—actually a compound of two towns, Petersburg and Lewistown. The river’s name is probably a translation of emiquon, an Illinois and Potawatomi Indian word referring to the mussel shells they used as spoons. Dickson Mounds, a rich archaeological area, is near the confluence of the Spoon and Illinois. At the beginning of the 21st century, ecological restoration efforts were underway at the confluence.
