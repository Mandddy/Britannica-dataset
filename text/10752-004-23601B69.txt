Isar River,  river, Bavaria Land (state), southern Germany. Rising at an elevation of 5,741 feet (1,750 m) in the Karwendelgebirge, just northeast of Innsbruck, Austria, the Isar runs west and then north crossing into Germany at Scharnitz Pass. The river there flows through a deep gorge that was used by the ancient Romans, who called it Porta Claudia. A rail line and road now thread the gorge. Turning east and north once again, the Isar emerges upon the Bavarian plain to flow northeast through Munich; it finally enters the Danube downstream from Regensburg. Much of the river, which is 183 miles (295 km) long, is swift and too shallow for navigation. Principal tributaries of the Isar are the Loisach, WÃ¼rm, and Amper.
