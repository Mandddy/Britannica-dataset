Stanford White,  (born November 9, 1853, New York, New York, U.S.â€”died June 25, 1906, New York) American architect who was the most-imaginative partner in the influential architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White.
Stanford White was the son of the essayist, critic, and Shakespearean scholar Richard Grant White. He was carefully trained as an architect by Henry Hobson Richardson. In June 1880 he joined Charles Follen McKim and William Rutherford Mead in founding a new architectural firm that soon became the most popular and prolific one in the country. Until about 1887 their organization concentrated on designing large country and seaside mansions in what was called the Shingle style. White designed one of the subtlest of these informally planned structures, the Casino (1881) at Newport, Rhode Island. Subsequently, the partners, aided by their gifted draftsman Joseph Morrill Wells, led the American trend toward Neoclassicism and away from styles then being developed in Chicago and elsewhere.
