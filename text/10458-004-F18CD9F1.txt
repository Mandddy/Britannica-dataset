Gustav Robert Kirchhoff,  (born March 12, 1824, Königsberg, Prussia [now Kaliningrad, Russia]—died  Oct. 17, 1887, Berlin, Ger.) German physicist who, with the chemist Robert Bunsen, firmly established the theory of spectrum analysis (a technique for chemical analysis by analyzing the light emitted by a heated material), which Kirchhoff applied to determine the composition of the Sun.
In 1845 Kirchhoff first announced Kirchhoff’s laws, which allow calculation of the currents, voltages, and resistances of electrical networks. Extending the theory of the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm, he generalized the equations describing current flow to the case of electrical conductors in three dimensions. In further studies he demonstrated that current flows through a conductor at the speed of light.
