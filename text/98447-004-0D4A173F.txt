Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, in full Dame Olga Maria Elisabeth Friederike Schwarzkopf   (born Dec. 9, 1915, Jarotschin, near Posen, Ger. [now Poznań, Pol.]—died Aug. 3, 2006, Schruns, Austria) German soprano who performed in the major opera houses of the Western world and is remembered especially for her mastery of German songs known as lieder.
Schwarzkopf studied at the Berlin High School for Music from 1934, winning various prizes. She also studied at Leicester in England, under a League of Nations scholarship. Her first appearance on the stage was as a flower maiden in Parsifal at the Berlin State Opera (1938), where she was soon singing a variety of roles. She captured the attention of Maria Ivogün, a Hungarian soprano, who taught her lieder singing. Schwarzkopf made her debut as a recitalist in Berlin in 1942. During World War II she joined the Nazi Party, and her membership later generated much controversy. Although she claimed to have become a member in order to continue performing, some suggested she had greater involvement.
