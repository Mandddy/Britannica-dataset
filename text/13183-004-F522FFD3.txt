Barre,  in ballet, the horizontal handrail, usually wooden, that is fixed to the walls of a ballet studio approximately 3.5 feet (1 m) from the floor. It is used by dancers as an aid to confidence and as a point of support during the preliminary exercises (“barre work”) that have been an essential part of ballet training since the development of classical ballet in the 19th century.
