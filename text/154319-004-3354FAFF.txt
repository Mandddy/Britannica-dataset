Mikhail Prokhorov, in full Mikhail Dmitrievich Prokhorov  (born May 3, 1965, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian businessman who made his fortune in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse by buying shares in formerly state-run corporations. He ran for the Russian presidency in 2012.
Prokhorov’s father worked for the Soviet sports committee, and his mother was a chemical engineer. An apt student, Prokhorov gained entrance to the Moscow Finance Institute (now the Russian Financial University) in 1982. A year later, however, he embarked upon a voluntary two-year stint in the Soviet army. He had previously been involved in Komsomol, the Soviet youth league, and eventually joined the Communist Party.
