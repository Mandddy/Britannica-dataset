Harihara, also spelled Hari-Hara,  in Hinduism, a deity combining the two major gods Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara). Images of Harihara (also known as Shambhu-Vishnu and Shankara-Narayana, variants of the names of the two gods) first appeared in the classical period, after sectarian movements, which elevated one god as supreme over the others, had waned sufficiently for efforts at compromise to be attempted. The dual form found special favour in Cambodia, where inscriptions and images from the 6th–7th century are known. In images of Harihara, the right half is depicted as Shiva and the left as Vishnu. The hands of Shiva hold the trishula (“trident”), a drum, and a small deer, and he may wear a tiger skin. The hands of Vishnu hold his characteristic conch shell and a chakra (discus). Half the headdress is shown with Shiva’s matted locks, which hold a crescent moon, and half as Vishnu’s crown; on the forehead, half of Shiva’s third eye is visible.
