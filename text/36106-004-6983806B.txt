Giovanni Battista Martini, byname Padre Martini   (born April 24, 1706, Bologna, Papal States—died  Aug. 3, 1784, Bologna) Italian composer, music theorist, and music historian who was internationally renowned as a teacher.
Martini was educated by his father, a violinist; by Luc’Antonio Predieri (harpsichord, singing, organ); and by Antonio Riccieri (counterpoint). He was ordained in 1729, after becoming chapelmaster of San Francesco in Bologna in 1725. He opened a school of music, and his fame as a teacher made Bologna a place of pilgrimage. Among his pupils were J.C. Bach, Mozart, Christoph Gluck, Niccolò Jommelli, and André Grétry; among his correspondents were the leading men of letters of his time, including Martin Agricola, Pietro Metastasio, Johann Quantz, and Jean-Philippe Rameau.
