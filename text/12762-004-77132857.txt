Concord coach,  American stagecoach, first manufactured in Concord, N.H., U.S., by the Abbot, Downing Company in 1827, and famous for its use in the American West. The body was supported on two reinforced leather straps running from front to back.
Relatively light models used on turnpikes in the East held four passengers and were pulled by two horses. Western Concord coaches, however, weighed about 2,500 pounds (1,130 kg) and were usually pulled by six or eight paired horses. Six or nine passengers could sit on the three seats inside; others sometimes sat in roof seats. The driverâ€™s seat accommodated a driver and one or two armed guards when necessary. These coaches were used in the West regularly until about 1910. They were also exported to South Africa, South America, and Australia.
