The Decemberists, American indie-rock group known for its highly stylized, literate songs. The band’s principal members were lead singer and guitarist Colin Meloy (b. October 5, 1974, Helena, Montana, U.S.), keyboardist and accordionist Jenny Conlee (b. December 12, 1971, Seattle, Washington), guitarist Chris Funk (b. November 28, 1971, Valparaiso, Indiana), drummer John Moen (b. August 23, 1968, Brainerd, Minnesota), and bassist Nate Query (b. September 5, 1973, Bellevue, Washington).
Formed in 2000 in Portland, Oregon, the Decemberists (with drummers Ezra Holbrook to 2002 and Rachel Blumberg from 2002 to 2005) initially hewed to a primarily folk-pop sound built around acoustic guitar melodies. Their first album, however, Castaways and Cutouts (2002), featured the baroque instrumentation and narrative song structures (as well as Meloy’s idiosyncratically nasal voice) that would become the band’s hallmarks.
