André Philippus Brink,  (born May 29, 1935, Vrede, South Africa—died February 6, 2015, in an airplane traveling from the Netherlands to South Africa) South African writer whose novels, which he wrote in Afrikaans and English versions, often criticized the South African government.
Brink was educated in South Africa and France. He later became professor of Afrikaans and Dutch literature at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, South Africa. He was one of a new generation of Afrikaans writers known as Die Sestigers (“the Sixtyers,” or writers of the 1960s), whose declared aim was “to broaden the rather too parochial limits of Afrikaner fiction.” In essence, this meant depicting sexual and moral matters and examining the political system in a way that rapidly antagonized the traditional Afrikaner reader.
