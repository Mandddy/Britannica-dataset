Polecat,  any of several weasellike carnivores of the family Mustelidae (which includes the weasel, mink, otter, and others). The pelt, especially of the European polecat, is called fitch in the fur trade.
The European, or common, polecat, also called foul marten for its odour (Mustela, sometimes Putorius, putorius), occurs in woodlands of Eurasia and North Africa. It weighs 0.5–1.4 kg (1–3 pounds) and is 35–53 cm (14–21 inches) long exclusive of the bushy tail, which is 13–20 cm long. Its long, coarse fur is brown above, black below, and marked with yellowish patches on the face. Much lighter fur distinguishes the masked, or steppe, polecat (M. p. eversmanni) of Asia.
