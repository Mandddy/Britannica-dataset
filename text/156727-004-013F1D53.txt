Qu’Appelle River, tributary of the Assiniboine River, in southern Saskatchewan and southwestern Manitoba, Canada. From its source near The Elbow (a bend in the South Saskatchewan River) and Lake Diefenbaker, northwest of Moose Jaw, Sask., the river flows eastward for 270 miles (430 km) through several lakes and First Nations (Indian) reservations before joining the Assiniboine opposite Saint-Lazare, Man., 10 miles (16 km) east of the provincial boundary. Its French name, meaning “who calls,” was derived from its Cree Indian name Kah-tep-was (“River That Calls”), referring to the cries of a legendary spirit supposedly haunting its waters. Once a fur-trapping region, its basin is now farmed for wheat. The Saskatchewan cities of Regina and Moose Jaw lie on Wascana and Moose Jaw creeks, respectively, tributaries of the Qu’Appelle.
