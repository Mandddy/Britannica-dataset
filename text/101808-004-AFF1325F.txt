Leipzig, city, western Saxony Land (state), east-central Germany. It lies just above the junction of the Pleisse, Parthe, and Weisse Elster rivers, about 115 miles (185 km) southwest of Berlin. Leipzig is situated in the fertile, low-lying Leipzig Basin, which has extensive deposits of lignite (brown coal). Although encircled by a belt of parks and gardens, the city is a major industrial centre and transport junction, and it lies at the core of the Halle-Leipzig metropolitan agglomeration. The countryside around the city consists of a plain that is intensively farmed.
Leipzig entered recorded history in ad 1015 as the fortified town of Urbs Libzi and was granted municipal status by 1170. Its favourable position in the middle of a plain intersected by the principal trade routes of central Europe stimulated the town’s commercial development. Its two annual markets, at Easter and at Michaelmas (September 29), were raised in 1497 to the rank of imperial fairs. Additional economic privileges enabled Leipzig to become the foremost German commercial centre by about 1700, a development that in turn promoted the growth of a network of roads converging on the town. Leipzig’s focal geographic situation had another, less fortunate consequence—several important battles were fought in or near the town. These included two at Breitenfeld (now a suburb) in 1631 and 1642, one at Lützen in 1632 during the Thirty Years’ War, and in particular the Battle of Leipzig (or Battle of the Nations) in October 1813 in the Napoleonic Wars.
