Brass,  alloy of copper and zinc, of historical and enduring importance because of its hardness and workability. The earliest brass, called calamine brass, dates to Neolithic times; it was probably made by reduction of mixtures of zinc ores and copper ores. In ancient documents, such as the Bible, the term brass is often used to denote bronze, the alloy of copper with tin.
The malleability of brass depends on the zinc content; brasses that contain more than 45 percent zinc are not workable, either hot or cold. Such brasses, known as white brasses, are of little industrial importance, though a granulated form is used in brazing (soldering); they also form the basis for certain alloys used in die-casting. The malleable brasses may be further subdivided into those that can be worked cold (generally those with less than 40 percent zinc) and those with a greater zinc content, which require hot working. The former group, known as the alpha brasses, are widely used in the manufacture of pins, bolts, screws, and ammunition cartridge cases. The beta brasses are less ductile but stronger and thus are suitable for the manufacture of faucet handles, sprinkler heads, window and door fittings, and other fixtures. A third group of brasses includes those with other elements besides copper and zinc, added to improve physical and mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, or machinability or to modify colour. Among these are the lead brasses, which are more easily machined; the naval and admiralty brasses, in which a small amount of tin improves resistance to corrosion by seawater; and the aluminum brasses, which provide strength and corrosion resistance where the naval brasses may fail.
