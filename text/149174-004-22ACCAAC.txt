River Yarrow, river located in Scotland, the headstreams of which rise on the eastern slopes of White Coomb at about 1,500 feet (460 metres) above sea level near the western boundary of Selkirk. They flow northeast as Yarrow Water through a small glaciated ribbon loch (lake) to a confluence with the Tweed near Abbotsford, a few miles west of Galashiels. The vale of Yarrow has strong literary associationsâ€”with border ballads, poets James Hogg and William Wordsworth, and Sir Walter Scott. The parish of Yarrow takes in one-third of Selkirk.
