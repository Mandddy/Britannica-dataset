Kristofer Oliver Uppdal,  (born February 19, 1878, Beitstad, Norway—died December 26, 1961, Oppdal) working-class Norwegian novelist whose major work is the 10-volume Dansen gjenom skuggeheimen (1911–24; “The Dance Through the World of Shadows”), which deals with the development of the Norwegian industrial working class from its peasant origin.
Uppdal was the heir to a farm, but his father went bankrupt. The future novelist began at age nine to support himself by working as a shepherd boy and farmhand. For several years he was a migrant worker in various regions of Norway. His life recapitulates the history of Norway’s labour movement in his rise from farm boy to skilled worker and eventually labour leader. He published his first poems in 1905, then devoted his most productive years to his powerful and monumental study of the subtle class distinctions within the working class. He did not desert poetry, however. Kulten (1947) is a colossal work containing an enormously difficult mixture of poetry and philosophy. Uppdal’s later years were unproductive, presumably as a result of mental illness.
