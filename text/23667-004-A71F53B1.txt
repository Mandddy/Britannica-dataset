Aaron Copland,  (born Nov. 14, 1900, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  Dec. 2, 1990, North Tarrytown [now Sleepy Hollow], N.Y.) American composer who achieved a distinctive musical characterization of American themes in an expressive modern style.
Copland, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, was born in New York City and attended public schools there. An older sister taught him to play the piano, and by the time he was 15 he had decided to become a composer. As a first step Copland tried to learn harmony through a correspondence course. Haltingly and in an environment not particularly conducive to art, he struggled toward his goal.
