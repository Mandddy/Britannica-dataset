Korean War Veterans Memorial, monument in Washington, D.C., honouring the U.S. military personnel who served in the Korean War (1950â€“53). It was authorized by Congress in 1986 and dedicated by U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton and South Korean Pres. Kim Young Sam on July 27, 1995, the 42nd anniversary of the signing of the cease-fire that ended hostilities. The memorial is located on a 2.2-acre (0.9-hectare) site at the western end of the Mall, southeast of the Lincoln Memorial and on the south side of the Reflecting Pool, across from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
A competition held for the design was won in 1989 by a team from the architecture school of Pennsylvania State University. The design was changed during the approval phase of the project, raising objections from the Pennsylvania State team, who filed a lawsuit; they ultimately lost their suit and removed their names from the project. The final design was constructed as modified by the architecture firm Cooper-Lecky Architects. Later on-site modifications were made to improve accessibility and to add a computerized honour roll of those killed in action, missing in action, or taken prisoners of war.
