Adrian II,  (born 792, Rome [Italy]—died c. Dec. 13, 872) pope from 867 to 872.
A relative of two previous popes, Stephen V and Sergius II, he had been called to the papacy twice before but declined. He accepted the call on Dec. 14, 867. Under his vigorous predecessor, St. Nicholas I, the papacy had reached a high point that Adrian could not maintain. Vacillatory and lacking continuity, he was snubbed by Charles II the Bald, king of France. He readmitted King Lothar II of Lorraine to communion, but Lothar’s early death (869) created a difficult problem of succession in which Adrian ineffectually intervened. Adrian also had difficulties with the powerful Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, Fr., by steadfastly upholding the unlimited right of bishops to appeal to the pope.
