Vera Lynn, in full Dame Vera Lynn, byname of Vera Margaret Welch  (born March 20, 1917, East Ham, Essex, [now Greater London], Eng.) English singer whose sentimental material and wholesome stage persona endeared her to the public during World War II. Broadcasts of her songs of love and longing were particularly resonant with members of the military fighting abroad, which led to her nickname, “the forces’ sweetheart.”
Welch, who was born into a working-class family outside London, began singing at men’s clubs by age seven. At 11 she assumed her grandmother’s maiden name (Lynn) and joined Madame Harris’s Kracker Kabaret Kids, a singing troupe. After leaving school at age 14, Lynn was spotted by a booking agent who found work for her at parties and events. In 1935 she sang the refrain on several big band records and began peforming on the radio with the Joe Loss Orchestra and then the Casani Club Band. She also recorded several songs with the Casani Club Band and released her first solo recording, “Up the Wooden Hill to Bedfordshire,” in 1936.
