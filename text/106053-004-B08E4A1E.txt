William Thomas Stead,  (born July 5, 1849, Embleton, Northumberland, England—died April 15, 1912, at sea, North Atlantic) British journalist, editor, and publisher who founded the noted periodical Review of Reviews (1890).
Stead was educated at home by his father, a clergyman, until he was 12 years old and then attended Silcoates School at Wakefield. He became an apprentice in a merchant’s countinghouse and in about 1870 began to contribute to the Liberal daily newspaper Northern Echo at Darlington. The following year he was invited to become the Echo’s editor. He and the paper diligently supported Prime Minister W.E. Gladstone. In 1880 he went to London as assistant editor of the Pall Mall Gazette under John Morley, later Viscount Morley. When Morley went into Parliament, Stead succeeded him as editor and made of the Pall Mall Gazette a sprightly and unconventional journal. He introduced such modern journalistic techniques as the use of illustrations. He also developed the interview form in newspaper writing. His press campaigns effected many changes, including the improvement of British naval defenses.
