Proterozoic Eon, the younger of the two divisions of Precambrian time, the older being the Archean Eon. The Proterozoic Eon extended from 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago and is often divided into the Paleoproterozoic (2.5 billion to 1.6 billion years ago), the Mesoproterozoic (1.6 billion to 1 billion years ago), and the Neoproterozoic (1 billion to 541 million years ago) eras. Proterozoic rocks have been identified on all the continents and often constitute important sources of metallic ores, notably of iron, gold, copper, uranium, and nickel. During the Proterozoic, the atmosphere and oceans changed significantly. Proterozoic rocks contain many definite traces of primitive life-formsâ€”the fossil remains of bacteria and blue-green algae, as well as of the first oxygen-dependent animals, the Ediacara fauna.
Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis. Free oxygen in the atmosphere increased significantly as a result of biological activity during the Proterozoic. The most important period of change occurred between 2.3 billion and 1.8 billion years ago when free oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels fluctuated during this time, coinciding with the peak deposition period of banded-iron formations, which removed surplus oxygen from the atmosphere throughout the world. Ferrous iron (Fe2+) in the oceans combined with atmospheric oxygen and, after oxidizing to Fe2O3, precipitated as the mineral hematite on the ocean floor. Continued biological activity allowed atmospheric oxygen concentrations to increase.
