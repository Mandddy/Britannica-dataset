Irazú Volcano, Spanish Volcán Irazú ,  active volcano, in the Cordillera Central, east-central Costa Rica. Its name originates from the indigenous word for “thunder.” The highest mountain in the Cordillera Central, Irazú reaches an elevation of 11,260 feet (3,432 metres). It is a popular ascent for tourists, as its cone offers (on rare clear days) views of both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Costa Rica. The active crater is 980 feet (300 metres) deep. Irazú Volcano National Park is linked by paved road to Cartago. The volcano’s eruptions of 1963–65 produced ash that dammed a nearby small river, flooding the city of Cartago and causing serious damage to coffee crops. The ashfall created considerable inconvenience for residents of San José, 34 miles (54 km) away.
