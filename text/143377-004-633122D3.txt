Pratima, (
        Sanskrit: “image” or “likeness” of a deity) also called murti (Sanskrit: “form” or “manifestation”) or vigraha (Sanskrit: “form”),  in Hinduism, a sacred image or depiction of a deity.
By depicting the deity with multiple heads, arms, or eyes or with animal features, the image, or icon, represents the deity’s many different aspects and powers. It serves as a vehicle through which the infinite and unmanifest god willingly takes finite and manifest form; the deity, when invoked, is believed to be present in the icon. Worship centring on the image has been a form of Hindu religious practice for about 2,000 years.
