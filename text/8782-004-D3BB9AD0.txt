Wallflower (genus Erysimum), genus of about 180 species of plants belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae), so named for their habit of growing from chinks in walls. Wallflowers are found throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere, and some species are widely cultivated for their attractive four-petaled flowers.
The Aegean wallflower (Erysiumu cheiri) is native to cliffsides and meadows of southern Europe and is naturalized in Great Britain. It is biennial to perennial, with erect 70-cm (28-inch) stalks bearing spikelike fragrant clusters of golden to brown flowers. Many ornamental cultivars have been derived from the species and are available in a range of colours. The western wallflower (E. asperum) is a 90-cm- (35-inch-) tall perennial found on prairies, sand hills, and open woods in central to western North America. It produces fragrant yellow to orange flowers borne on long spikes. It is sometimes used in rock gardens.
