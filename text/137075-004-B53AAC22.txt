Betelgeuse, also called Alpha Orionis,  second brightest star in the constellation Orion, marking the eastern shoulder of the hunter. Its name is derived from the Arabic word bat al-jawzāʾ, which means “the giant’s shoulder.” Betelgeuse has a variable apparent magnitude of about 0.6 and is one of the most luminous stars in the night sky. It is easily discernible to even the casual observer, not only because of its brightness and position in the brilliant Orion but also because of its deep reddish colour. The star is approximately 640 light-years from Earth.
Betelgeuse is a red supergiant star roughly 950 times as large as the Sun, making it one of the largest stars known. For comparison, the diameter of Mars’s orbit around the Sun is 328 times the Sun’s diameter. Infrared studies from spacecraft have revealed that Betelgeuse is surrounded by immense shells of material evidently shed by the star during episodes of mass loss over the past 100,000 years. The largest of these shells has a radius of nearly 7.5 light-years.
