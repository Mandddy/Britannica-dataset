Dormouse (family Myoxidae), any of 27 species of small-bodied Eurasian, Japanese, and African rodents. The largest, weighing up to 180 grams (6.3 ounces), is the fat, or edible, dormouse (Glis glis) of Europe and the Middle East, with a body up to 19 cm (7.5 inches) long and a shorter tail up to 15 cm. One of the smallest is the Japanese dormouse of southern Japan (Glirulus japonicus), weighing up to 40 grams and having a body that measures less than 8 cm long and a tail of up to 6 cm. Dormice are small to medium-sized and have large eyes, rounded ears, short legs and digits, and hairy or bushy tails. Their gray to reddish fur is soft and dense; some species have a dark stripe along the back and dark facial markings.
Dormice are primarily nocturnal, but some are active during the day. Most species are arboreal and agile climbers, but some thrive in treeless, arid regions. Some are adept rock climbers, reportedly able to scale vertical rock faces and even walk upside down under rock ledges. Dormice construct globular nests in trees, bushes, rock crevices, and burrows and among tree roots; some also utilize abandoned bird or squirrel nests and, occasionally, active beehives. Their diet consists of fruit, nuts, insects, spiders, bird eggs and nestlings, and small rodentsâ€”even other dormice.
