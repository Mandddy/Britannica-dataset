Derek Jeter, in full Derek Sanderson Jeter  (born June 26, 1974, Pequannock, New Jersey, U.S.) American professional baseball player who, as a shortstop for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB), was selected to multiple American League (AL) All-Star teams and was one of the most popular players of his time.
Jeter grew up in Michigan and started playing Little League baseball when he was about five years old. After an impressive high school baseball record, including a .557 batting average in his junior year, he was drafted as a first-round pick in 1992 by the Yankees. He started at the minor league Class A Tampa Yankees and did poorly, with 21 errors in 58 games. Over the next few years, Jeter improved and was named Most Outstanding Major League Prospect by the South Atlantic League in 1993 and Minor League Player of the Year by Baseball America in 1994.
