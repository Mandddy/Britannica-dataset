Haim Naḥman Bialik ,  (born January 9, 1873, Radi, Volhynia, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died July 4, 1934, Vienna, Austria) a leading Hebrew poet, esteemed for expressing in his verse the yearnings of the Jewish people and for making the modern Hebrew language a flexible medium of poetic expression.
Born into poverty, Bialik was left fatherless when he was five or six years old and was brought up by his rigidly pious, learned grandfather. After an intensive education in the Jewish classics, he attended for a short time the Jewish academy in Volozhin (now Valozhyn, Belarus). These three influences—his poverty, his being an orphan, and his study of Jewish religious classics—were the wellsprings of much of Bialik’s poetry. In 1891 he went to Odessa, then the centre of Jewish modernism, where he struck up a lifelong friendship with the Jewish author Aḥad Haʿam, who encouraged Bialik in his creative writing.
