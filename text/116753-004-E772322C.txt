The University of Alabama, the state’s oldest public university, was originally located in Tuscaloosa. The U.S. government authorized land for the university in 1819, and it was chartered in 1820, when it received a land grant from the state. Instruction began in 1831. In 1860 the university became a military school, eventually providing officers for the Confederacy. Union cavalry destroyed much of the campus in 1865, and instruction could not be resumed until 1869. Women were first admitted to the university in 1893. The court-ordered end of racial segregation at the university in June 1963 was initially met with protest by Alabama governor George C. Wallace. The Huntsville campus opened in 1950, and the Birmingham campus joined the university in 1969. Alabama football (gridiron) teams have won a dozen national championships, six of them under coach Bear Bryant.
