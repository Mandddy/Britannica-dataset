Dracaena, genus of ornamental foliage plants in the subfamily Nolinoideae (family Asparagaceae), consisting of between 40 and 100 species native primarily to the Old World tropics. Most species have short stalks and narrow sword-shaped leaves, but some have taller stalks and resemble trees with crowns of leaves. The small flowers are red, yellow, or green and produce berrylike fruit with one to three seeds.
Dracaena sanderiana, with white-edged leaves, and D. fragrans, with yellow leaf edges or white stripes, are commonly cultivated as houseplants. The dragon tree (D. draco) is an ornamental tree from the Canary Islands that can grow 18 metres (60 feet) tall and 6 metres (20 feet) wide and produces orange fruit. The trunk contains a red gum, called dragonâ€™s blood, valued for its medicinal properties. The species is listed as vulnerable in its native habitat because of overharvesting.
