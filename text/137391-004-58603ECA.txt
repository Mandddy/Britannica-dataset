Longclaw (genus Macronyx), any of eight species of African insect-eating birds that are related to the pipits. Found on prairies and grasslands, they are surprisingly like meadowlarks (family Icteridae), which are New World birds; both are the same size and shape and have streaked brown backs, bright yellow underparts, a black V on the neck, and white tail feathers. This is a case of convergenceâ€”similar adaptations to similar ecological roles among unrelated species.
