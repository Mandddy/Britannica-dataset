In 1861 an act of the territorial legislature of Colorado called for the creation of a public university in Boulder. The university was not officially founded until 1876, and instruction began the next year. The Denver campus was founded in 1912, the Health Sciences Center in 1924, and the Colorado Springs branch opened in 1965. The 1989 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was shared by Thomas Cech, a professor at Colorado, and Sidney Altman, a graduate of the university. Other notable alumni include writer Jean Stafford and Supreme Court Justice Byron R. White.
