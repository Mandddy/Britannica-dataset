Brown recluse (Loxosceles reclusa), also called violin spider,  venomous light tan or yellow spider most common in the western and southern United States. It has a body length of about 7 mm (0.25 inch) and a leg span of about 2.5 cm (1 inch). On the front half of its body (the cephalothorax), it has a dark violin-shaped design, the “neck” of which is formed by a conspicuous furrow on the midline of its back. The spider’s six eyes are arranged in two rows.
The brown recluse has extended its range into parts of the northern United States. Its natural habitat is in caves, rodent burrows, and other protected environments. In buildings it is typically found in undisturbed locations such as attics, storage areas, and wall or ceiling voids. The venom of the brown recluse destroys the walls of blood vessels near the site of the bite, sometimes causing a large skin ulcer. The wound, which may require several months to heal, is occasionally fatal.
