Rafael Alberti,  (born Dec. 16, 1902, Puerto de Santa María, Spain—died Oct. 28, 1999, Puerto de Santa María) Spanish writer of Italian Irish ancestry, regarded as one of the major Spanish poets of the 20th century.
Alberti studied art in Madrid and enjoyed some success as a painter before 1923, when he began writing and publishing poems in magazines. His first book of poetry, Marinero en tierra (1925; “Sailor on Land”), recalled the sea of his native Cádiz region and won a national prize. A member of the so-called Generation of 1927, Alberti helped to celebrate the tercentenary of Luis de Góngora in 1927, and Góngorist influence is apparent in the work published in that period, El alba del alhelí (1927; “The Dawn of the Wallflower”) and Cal y canto (1928; “Quicklime and Song”). With his next book, the somewhat Surrealist Sobre los ángeles (1929; Concerning the Angels), Alberti established himself as a mature and individual voice.
