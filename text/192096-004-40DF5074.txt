Duane Hanson, in full Duane Elwood Hanson  (born January 17, 1925, Alexandria, Minnesota, U.S.—died January 6, 1996, Boca Raton, Florida) American figurative sculptor whose lifelike figures made of cast fibreglass and polyester resin and dressed in everyday clothes often fooled the public into believing that they were viewing real people. Because of its faithfulness to reality, Hanson’s work is often categorized with that of the Photo-realist painters of the same era, who based their paintings on photographic images. Unlike the two-dimensional paintings, however, Hanson’s three-dimensional objects, life-size and realistic down to the hair on their arms, are uncanny in that they are simultaneously familiar in their lifelike appearance and yet strange as static works of art.
Hanson received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1946. He continued his studies at the University of Minnesota and in 1951 completed an M.F.A. in sculpture at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Hanson taught for several years in Germany, where he met the German artist George Grygo, whose work in polyester resin and fibreglass had a great influence on his sculptures. Hanson returned to the United States and settled in Atlanta, where he taught art at Oglethorpe University and began his own experiments with polyester resin and fibreglass. From 1965 to 1969 Hanson lived in Miami. During that period, in 1967, he produced his first life-size work. After living in New York City for a short time, Hanson moved back to Florida in 1973 and spent the rest of his life there.
