Water resource, any of the entire range of natural waters that occur on the Earth, regardless of their state (i.e., vapour, liquid, or solid) and that are of potential use to humans. Of these, the resources most available for use are the waters of the oceans, rivers, and lakes; other available water resources include groundwater and deep subsurface waters and glaciers and permanent snowfields.
Human use of natural waters, particularly of freshwater resources, has increased steadily over the centuries. It is unlikely that this trend will change given the continued growth of population and the ever-widening utilization of water for agricultural, industrial, and recreational purposes. This situation has given rise to growing concern over the availability of adequate water supplies to accommodate the future needs of society. Surface-water resources are already being used to their maximum capacity in various regions of the world, as, for example, in the southwestern United States.
