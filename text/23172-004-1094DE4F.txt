ABBA, Swedish Europop group that was among the most commercially successful groups in the history of popular music. In the 1970s it dominated the European charts with its catchy pop songs. Members included songwriter and keyboard player Benny Andersson (b. Dec. 16, 1946, Stockholm, Swed.), songwriter and guitarist Björn Ulvaeus (b. April 25, 1945, Gothenburg, Swed.), and vocalists Agnetha Fältskog (b. April 5, 1950, Jönköping, Swed.) and Anni-Frid Lyngstad (b. Nov. 15, 1945, Narvik, Nor.).
The group began to take shape in 1969, when Andersson and Ulvaeus, who had previously collaborated on a number of folk and pop projects, met Lyngstad and Fältskog. In addition to working together musically, the four paired off romantically, with Andersson becoming involved with Lyngstad and Ulvaeus dating Fältskog. The quartet debuted as the cabaret act Festfolk, a name chosen to play on two words with nearly identical pronunciations in Swedish: festfolk, meaning “party people,” and fästfolk, a 1970s slang term for “engaged couples.” Ulvaeus and Fältskog were married in 1971, and Andersson and Lyngstad followed suit in 1978. While Festfolk failed to gain a following in Sweden, the song “People Need Love,” which the group recorded as Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid, was a modest hit in 1972. The following year the foursome finished third in the Swedish qualifying round of the Eurovision Song Contest, with the single “Ring, Ring.” Encouraged by that success and dubbed ABBA—an acronym derived from the members’ first names—by the group’s manager, Stig Anderson, the band returned to Eurovision in 1974 and captured the top prize with the song “Waterloo.” The resulting single served as the anchor for the album of the same name, released that year.
