Sigismund II Augustus,  (born Aug. 1, 1520, Kraków, Pol.—died  July 7, 1572, Knyszyn) last Jagiellon king of Poland, who united Livonia and the duchy of Lithuania with Poland, creating a greatly expanded and legally unified kingdom.
The only son of Sigismund I the Old and Bona Sforza, Sigismund II was elected and crowned coruler with his father in 1530. He ruled the duchy of Lithuania from 1544 and became king of Poland after his father’s death in April 1548. After his first wife died childless (1545), he secretly married Barbara Radziwiłł, of a Lithuanian magnate family (1547). When he announced his marriage in 1548, the szlachta (Polish gentry) tried to force an annulment because it feared the influence of the Radziwiłłs. He overcame the opposition, but Barbara died childless in 1551, allegedly poisoned by Sigismund’s mother. A third marriage (1553), to his first wife’s sister Catherine, also proved childless, and at his death the direct Jagiellon line ended.
