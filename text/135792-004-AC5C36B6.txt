Alex Salmond,  (born December 31, 1954, Linlithgow, Scotland) Scottish politician who served in the British House of Commons (1987– ) and as first minister of Scotland (2007–14).
Salmond studied economics at the University of St. Andrews and joined the civil service as an assistant economist (1978–80) for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland before working as an economist (1980–87) for the Royal Bank of Scotland. From an early age he gained a reputation as something of a rebel. He joined the pro-Scottish independence Scottish National Party (SNP) as a student and was a prominent member of the 79 Group, a socialist republican faction that called for the SNP to become more aggressively radical following the 1979 British general elections. Salmond was expelled from the SNP in 1982 when the 79 Group was banned. His exclusion lasted just one month, however, and by 1985 he was one of the SNP’s leading strategists.
