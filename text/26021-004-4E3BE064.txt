Henry Jarvis Raymond,  (born Jan. 24, 1820, near Lima, N.Y., U.S.—died  June 18, 1869, New York City) U.S. journalist and politician who, as first editor and chief proprietor of The New York Times (from 1851), did much to elevate the style and tone of contemporary newspapers and who was prominent in forming the Republican Party.
Raymond worked for Horace Greeley on the weekly New Yorker in 1840 and then from 1841 to 1848 on the daily New York Tribune. As early as 1843 he and George Jones had planned their own newspaper, but lack of capital forced postponement of the project until Sept. 18, 1851, when the first issue of the New York Daily Times (renamed The New York Times in 1857) was published. The paper was largely free from the hyper-emotional writing and the emphasis on extremist personalities that was common in the 1850s, a period of factional and sectional hatreds that were exploited by many journalists and helped bring on the American Civil War (1861–65). During that conflict, as in the war of France and Piedmont against Austria in 1859, Raymond served as a war correspondent.
