William Camden,  (born May 2, 1551, London, Eng.—died  Nov. 9, 1623, Chislehurst, Kent) English antiquary, a pioneer of historical method, and author of Britannia, the first comprehensive topographical survey of England.
Educated at Christ’s Hospital and St. Paul’s School, Camden was admitted to Magdalen College, Oxford, but moved to Broadgates Hall (later Pembroke College) and then to Christ Church, becoming B.A. in 1573. In 1571 he had moved to London, and in 1575 he was appointed second master of Westminster School and in 1593 headmaster. In 1595 he published a Greek grammar. In 1589 Camden was granted the prebend of Ilfracombe and in 1597 was appointed Clarenceux king-of-arms. He was thereby relieved of a schoolmaster’s chores and given more time for writing.
