Powwow, a celebration of American Indian culture in which people from diverse indigenous nations gather for the purpose of dancing, singing, and honouring the traditions of their ancestors. The term powwow, which derives from a curing ritual, originated in one of the Algonquian nations of the Northeast Indians. During the early 1800s, traveling medicine shows selling cure-all tonics used “powwow” to describe their wares. These vendors often employed local Indians to dance for the entertainment of potential customers, who soon applied the term to the exhibition dancing as well as to the patent medicines. The name took hold, and Indians themselves added to it their nomenclature to describe dancing for an audience in an exhibition.
Today powwows take place over a period of one to four days and often draw dancers, singers, artists, and traders from hundreds of miles away. Spectators (including non-Indians) are welcome to attend, as participants seek to share the positive aspects of their culture with outsiders. Modern powwows can be grouped into two broad divisions: “competition” (or “contest”) events and those referred to as “traditional.” Competition events offer substantial prize money in various standardized dance and music categories. In contrast, traditional powwows offer small amounts of “day money” to all or some portion of the participants (such as the first 10, 20, or 30 dancers to register) and do not have competitive dancing or singing. Both divisions share the same order of events and styles of singing and dancing.
