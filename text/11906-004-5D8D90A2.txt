Ferdowsī, also spelled Firdawsī, Firdusi, or Firdousi, pseudonym of Abū al-Qasem Manṣūr  (born c. 935, near Ṭūs, Iran—died c. 1020–26, Ṭūs) Persian poet, author of the Shāh-nāmeh (“Book of Kings”), the Persian national epic, to which he gave a final and enduring form, although he based his poem mainly on an earlier prose version.
Ferdowsī was born in a village on the outskirts of the ancient city of Ṭūs. In the course of the centuries, many legends have been woven around the poet’s name, but very little is known about the real facts of his life. The only reliable source is given by Neẓāmī-ye ʿArūẓī, a 12th-century poet who visited Ferdowsī’s tomb in 1116 or 1117 and collected the traditions that were current in his birthplace less than a century after his death.
