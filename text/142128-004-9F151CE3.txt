Lacerta (family Lacertidae), genus of lizards of the family Lacertidae that includes among its nearly 50 species most European lizards and some Asian and northern African species. Lacerta and its allies, such as the Gallotia and Podarcis lizards, are commonly called wall or rock lizards. Lacerta species have well-developed limbs and deeply notched tongues. They have small back scales and large throat shields that form a well-defined collar.
These lizards are predominantly egg layers and insectivores. They also include some species entirely made up of females that reproduce through parthenogenesis.
