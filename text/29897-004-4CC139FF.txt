Johann Bernoulli,  (born August 6 [July 27, Old Style], 1667, Basel, Switzerland—died January 1, 1748, Basel) major member of the Bernoulli family of Swiss mathematicians. He investigated the then new mathematical calculus, which he applied to the measurement of curves, to differential equations, and to mechanical problems.
The son of a pharmacist, Johann studied medicine and obtained a doctor’s degree in Basel in 1694, with a thesis on muscular contraction. However, he turned to mathematics despite his father’s opposition. In 1691–92 he wrote two texts, not published until later, on differential and integral calculus. In 1692 he taught calculus to the mathematician Guillaume-François-Antoine, marquis de L’Hôpital, who later agreed to pay him for mathematical discoveries. From 1695 to 1705 he taught mathematics at Groningen, Netherlands, and, on the death of his elder brother, Jakob, assumed a professorship at Basel.
