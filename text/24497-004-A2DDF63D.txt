Robert Desnos,  (born July 4, 1900, Paris—died  June 8, 1945, Terezín, Czech.) French poet who joined André Breton in the early Surrealist movement, soon becoming one of its most valuable members because of his ability to fall into a hypnotic trance, under which he could recite his dreams, write, and draw. Texts from this period appeared in the Surrealist review Littérature and in his book La Liberté ou l’amour! (1927; “Liberty or Love!”). Humour, tenderness, and eroticism pervade his works, in which acrobatic verbal techniques never detract from the spontaneity of the inspiration. Dreams and reality merge in freely associated images in Corps et biens (1930; “Bodies and Goods”). In 1930 he broke from the doctrinaire Surrealist rigidity of Breton and for a decade wrote motion-picture and radio scripts, including the highly successful Complainte de Fantomas (1933; “Fantomas’ Lament”).
Desnos later abandoned the eccentric experiments in Surrealistic verse for more traditional and classical forms that made it easier to express his humanitarian sympathies aroused by World War II. His works of this period include Fortunes (1942), État de veille (1943; “The Wakeful State”), and Contrée (1944; “Country”). Arrested for his activity in the Resistance, he was deported and died of typhus shortly after his camp was liberated. A collection including both his early Surrealist poems and later works, Domaine public (“Public Domain”), appeared in 1953. The Selected Poems of Robert Desnos was published in 1991.
