Middlesex,  county, northeastern Massachusetts, U.S., west and northwest of Boston and bordered on the north by New Hampshire. The county consists of an upland region drained by the Merrimack, Nashua, Assabet, Concord, Sudbury, and Shawsheen rivers. Other waterways include Whitehall and Cambridge reservoirs, Lake Cochituate, and historic Walden Pond. Parklands include more than 20 state and federal sites, notably Townsend and Willard Brook state forests, Hopkinton and Cochituate state parks, and Minute Man National Historical Park.
Middlesex was created in May 1643 as one of Massachusetts’ three original counties and was named for Middlesex, England. The county seat is Cambridge, the home of Harvard University (founded 1636) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1861). Other institutions of higher education include Boston College (1863) in Chestnut Hill–Newton, Tufts University (1852) in Medford, and Bentley College (1917) and Brandeis University (1948) in Waltham. Lowell, to the north, is the nation’s first planned industrial community (incorporated town, 1826). Connected by Battle Road, Lexington and Concord were the first battlefields of the U.S. War of Independence. Several notable 19th-century writers lived in the county: Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Louisa May Alcott.
