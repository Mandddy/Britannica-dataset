Powdery mildew,  plant disease of worldwide occurrence, caused by many specialized races of fungal species in the genera Erysiphe, Microsphaera, Phyllactinia, Podosphaera, Sphaerotheca, and Uncinula. Hundreds of species of trees, shrubs, vines, flowers, vegetables, fruits, grasses, field crops, and weeds can be affected by powdery mildew.
A superficial, white or light gray, powdery to felty growth of intertwined hyphae (fungus strands) forms on the surface of leaves, buds, young shoots, fruits, and even flowers. The white, powdery appearance is due to large numbers of microscopic spores (conidia) borne in chains. These wind-borne spores uniquely do not require free water for germination and infection. New crops of conidia can be produced every 3 to 14 days. If the disease is severe, the mildewed plant parts may be stunted and distorted. Leaves commonly turn yellow and wither, flowers are distorted or fewer in number, and fruit yield and quality are reduced. Mildew is most severe in crowded, shady, poorly aerated locations when nights are cool and days are warm. At maturity, or in the fall, round black specks, which are sexual fruiting bodies, or cleistothecia, may form in the mildew. In the spring the cleistothecia crack open to release one or more spore sacs (asei) containing ascospores that blow to nearby plant parts and initiate infection. Overwintering also occurs as mycelial mats on crops or weeds. Sulfur dust, lime sulfur, and dinocap (Karathane) are effective against many powdery mildews but should not be applied in hot weather.
