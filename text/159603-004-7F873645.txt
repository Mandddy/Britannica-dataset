James T. Farrell, in full James Thomas Farrell   (born February 27, 1904, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died August 22, 1979, New York, New York) American novelist and short-story writer known for his realistic portraits of the lower-middle-class Irish in Chicago, drawn from his own experiences.
Farrell belonged to a working-class Irish American family. His impoverished parents gave Farrell over to be raised by middle-class relatives. Financing himself by working at various jobs, including gas-station attendant, Farrell attended the University of Chicago from 1925 to 1929. He began to write seriously about 1925, shaping his writing to reveal his conviction that destinies are shaped by environment. He left the university before graduating, determined to become a writer. In 1931 he went to Paris with a young woman. The next year he settled down in New York City and published the first volume of his well-known Studs Lonigan trilogy, Young Lonigan. It was followed by The Young Manhood of Studs Lonigan in 1934 and Judgment Day in 1935. The series traces the self-destruction of a young man who has been spiritually crippled by the morally squalid urban environment in which he lives. Danny O’Neill, a character introduced in Studs Lonigan, is the subject of a later series (1936–53), in which he reflects Farrell’s acquired faith in humanitarian values and man’s power to cope with circumstances. Of this series the volume The Face of Time (1953) is considered one of Farrell’s best works.
