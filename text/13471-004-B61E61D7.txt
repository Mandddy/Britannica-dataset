Andalusite,  (Al2SiO5), aluminum silicate mineral that occurs in relatively small amounts in various metamorphic rocks, particularly in altered sediments. It is found in commercial quantities in the Inyo Mountains, Mono county, Calif., in the United States; in Kazakhstan; and in South Africa. Such deposits are mined as a raw material for refractories and porcelain used in spark plugs and other products. For detailed physical properties, see silicate mineral (table 2).
Andalusite of gem quality occurs as greenish or reddish pebbles in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and in Sri Lanka. The variety chiastolite (also called cross-stone, or macle), characteristic of clay slates near a granite contact, forms elongated prismatic crystals enclosing symmetrically arranged wedges of carbonaceous material. In cross section, it shows a black cross on a grayish ground; polished cross sections of the mineral are sometimes worn as charms. It is polymorphous with kyanite and sillimanite.
