Edmund Beecher Wilson,  (born Oct. 19, 1856, Geneva, Ill., U.S.—died  March 3, 1939, New York, N.Y.) American biologist known for his researches in embryology and cytology.
In 1891 Wilson joined the faculty of Columbia University, where he elevated the department of zoology to a peak of international prestige. His first experimental studies, in embryology, led him to investigations at the cellular level. He became established as an outstanding pioneer in work on cell lineage—i.e., the tracing of the formation of different kinds of tissues from individual precursor cells. His interest then extended to internal cellular organization; publication of his Cell in Development and Inheritance (1896) deeply influenced the trend of biological thought. The problem of sex determination became his next concern, and his cytological studies, culminating in a series of papers on the relation of chromosomes to the determination of sex, the first published in 1905, represented the pinnacle of his scientific achievement. Having recognized the importance of Gregor Mendel’s earlier findings on heredity when they were rediscovered in 1900, Wilson realized that the role of chromosomes went far beyond the determination of sex; he envisioned their function as important components in heredity as a whole. His ideas exerted a powerful force in shaping future research in genetics and cell biology.
