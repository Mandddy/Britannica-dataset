Hiram Powers,  (born June 29, 1805, Woodstock, Vermont, U.S.—died June 27, 1873, Florence, Italy) American sculptor who worked in the Neoclassical style during the mid-1800s. He is best remembered for his Greek Slave (1843), a white marble statue of a nude girl in chains.
Powers first studied with Frederick Eckstein about 1828. About 1829 he worked as a general assistant and artist in a wax museum in Cincinnati, Ohio, where his ingenious representations of scenes from Dante’s Inferno met with acclaim. At the end of 1834 Powers went to Washington, D.C., where he modeled a portrait of Andrew Jackson (1835). The attention he received for this work led to other portrait commissions from local residents, bringing Powers newfound financial security. He traveled to Italy in 1835 and in 1837, after residing in Paris for a few months, settled permanently in Florence, where he befriended the American sculptor Horatio Greenough, whom he represented in an 1838 marble portrait bust.
