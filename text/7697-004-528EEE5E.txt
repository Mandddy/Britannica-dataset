Advertising coloration, in animals, the use of biological coloration to make an organism unique and highly visible as compared with the background, thereby providing easily perceived information as to its location, identity, and movement. Such advertisement may serve the function of attracting individuals in order to enter into some advantageous interaction (e.g., courtship for reproductive purposes) or of warning or repelling other organisms (aposematic coloration). An example is when a conspicuous pattern, such as the black and yellow coloration of many wasps and bees, advertises to a predator that an animal is unpalatable or poses special dangers.
