Mordecai Anielewicz, also spelled Mordechai Anilowitz  (born 1919, Wyszków, Poland—died May 8, 1943, Warsaw) hero and principal leader of armed Jewish resistance in the Warsaw ghetto during World War II.
Anielewicz was born into a working-class family and attended a Hebrew academic secondary school. As a boy he joined Betar, a Zionist youth organization that among other things advocated self-defense for Jews. By 1940 he had gone to Warsaw and become active in a pro-Soviet group of young Zionists, Hashomer Hatzair. When Germany invaded Poland, he escaped to Vilna (now Vilnius), which the Soviet Union had annexed with Lithuania. He eventually made his way back to the Warsaw ghetto, where he set up an underground newspaper, Neged Hazerem (“Against the Stream”), and organized cultural and educational activities. He was out of Warsaw, spreading his educational and political ideas covertly in western Poland, when the SS (the Nazi paramilitary corps) decimated the population of the Warsaw ghetto by deportation and execution in late summer 1942. Over two months about 265,000 Jews were deported without open armed resistance to the newly established extermination camp of Treblinka, some 50 miles (80 km) away.
