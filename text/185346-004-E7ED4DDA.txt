Rusyn, Rusyn ruskyi, also called Ruthenian, Carpatho-Rusyn, Lemko, or Rusnak,  any of several East Slavic peoples (modern-day Belarusians, Ukrainians, and Carpatho-Rusyns) and their languages. The name Rusyn is derived from Rus (Ruthenia), the name of the territory that they inhabited. The name Ruthenian derives from the Latin Ruthenus (singular), a term found in medieval sources to describe the Slavic inhabitants of Eastern Christian religion (Orthodox and Greek Catholics) living in the grand duchy of Lithuania and, after 1569, in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Rusyn-inhabited territories in those states had from the 10th to the 14th century belonged to several principalities referred to collectively as Kievan Rus. The Latin term Ruthenus (plural Rutheni) is the equivalent of the Slavic Rusyn (plural Rusyny), meaning “an inhabitant of the land of Rus.”
Rusyn (Ruthenian) refers as well to language. Ruthenian was the term used to describe the written medium (initially based on spoken Belarusian) that functioned as the official or chancellery language of the grand duchy of Lithuania and to refer to the spoken, or simple (prosta), language of the duchy’s East Slavic inhabitants (present-day Belarusians and Ukrainians). Ruthenian (German: Ruthenisch; Hungarian: rutén) was also the official designation for the spoken and written language of the East Slavs (present-day Ukrainians and Carpatho-Rusyns) living in the Habsburg-ruled Austrian Empire. Today the name Rusyn refers to the spoken language and variants of a literary language codified in the 20th century for Carpatho-Rusyns living in Ukraine (Transcarpathia), Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Serbia (the Vojvodina).
