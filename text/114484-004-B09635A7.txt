Baku, Azerbaijani Bakı,  city, capital of Azerbaijan. It lies on the western shore of the Caspian Sea and the southern side of the Abşeron Peninsula, around the wide, curving sweep of the Bay of Baku. The bay, sheltered by the islands of the Baku Archipelago, provides the best harbour of the Caspian, while the Abşeron Peninsula gives protection from violent northerly winds. The name Baku is possibly a contraction of the Persian bad kube (“blown upon by mountain winds”). Baku derives its importance from its oil industry and its administrative functions.
The first historical reference to Baku dates from 885 ce, although archaeological evidence indicates a settlement there several centuries before Christ. By the 11th century ce, Baku was in the possession of the Shīrvān-Shāhs, who made it their capital in the 12th century, although for a period in the 13th and 14th centuries it came under the sway of the Mongols. In 1723 Peter I (the Great) captured Baku, but it was returned to Persia in 1735; Russia captured it finally in 1806. In 1920 Baku became capital of the Azerbaijan republic.
