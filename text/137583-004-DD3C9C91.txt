Olivier de Clisson,  (born c. 1332, Brittany [France]—died  April 23, 1407, Josselin, Brittany) military commander who served England, France, and Brittany during the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) and ultimately did much to keep Brittany within the French sphere of influence.
Brought up in England, Clisson fought on the English side for the Breton duke John IV (or V; John of Montfort) against the French-supported Charles of Blois in the War of the Breton Succession (1341–64) and won the Battle of Auray (1364), in which Charles was killed. In 1365, however, he left John IV, who would not reward his services adequately, and went over to the French. Appointed lieutenant of Guyenne by France’s King Charles V in 1369, he conducted a fierce struggle against the English there and became notorious for cruelty. After serving as lieutenant general in Brittany (1374), he was made constable of France (1380) and defeated the Flemings at the Battle of Rozebeke (Nov. 27, 1382). Deprived of his office of constable after King Charles VI’s attack of madness, Clisson became reconciled (1395) with John IV, who, on his deathbed (1399), appointed him guardian of his children and protector of Brittany.
