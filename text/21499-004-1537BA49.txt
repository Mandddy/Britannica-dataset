Harriet Elizabeth Prescott Spofford, née Harriet Elizabeth Prescott  (born April 3, 1835, Calais, Maine, U.S.—died Aug. 14, 1921, Amesbury, Mass.) American writer whose Gothic romances are set apart by luxuriant description and her unconventional handling of the female stereotypes of her day.
Harriet Prescott moved from her native Maine to Newburyport, Massachusetts, in 1849 and attended the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire, in 1853–55. In part to aid the family’s precarious finances and with the encouragement of social reformer and author Thomas W.S. Higginson, she turned to writing. Several of her stories were published in Boston newspapers, and her tale “In a Cellar” appeared in the Atlantic Monthly in 1859. In 1860 her first novel appeared anonymously as Sir Rohan’s Ghost. She published The Amber Gods (1863), a collection of stories, and Azarian: An Episode (1864), a novel, before marrying Richard S. Spofford in 1865.
