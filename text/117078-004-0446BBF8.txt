Jacks, also called jackstones, fivestones, or dibs,  game of great antiquity and worldwide distribution, now played with stones, bones, seeds, filled cloth bags, or metal or plastic counters (the jacks), with or without a ball. The name derives from “chackstones”—stones to be tossed. The knuckle, wrist, or ankle bones (astragals) of goats, sheep, or other animals also have been used in play. Such objects have been found in prehistoric caves in Kiev, Ukraine, and pictures of the game are depicted on jars from ancient Greece.
In the classic game five or more counters are thrown into the air with one hand, the object being to catch them either in the palm or on the back of that hand. Those so caught count for the player, and those missed count against him. In contemporary games, there have been two developments: one emphasizing skill (as in the modern game of jacks, or jackstones) and the other, the accumulation of as many counters as possible.
