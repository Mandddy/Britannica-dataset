Moẓaffar od-Dīn Shāh,  (born 1852, Tehrān, Iran—died  Jan. 9, 1907, Tehrān) Persian ruler of the Qājār dynasty whose incompetence precipitated a constitutional revolution in 1906.
The son of the Qājār ruler Naṣer od-Dīn Shāh, Moẓaffar od-Dīn was named crown prince and sent as governor to the northern province of Azerbaijan in 1861. He spent his 35 years as crown prince in the pursuit of pleasure; his relations with his father were frequently strained, and he was not consulted in important matters of state. Thus, when he ascended the throne in May 1896, he was unprepared for the burdens of office. At Moẓaffar’s accession Iran faced a financial crisis, with annual governmental expenditures far in excess of revenues. He had to make up this deficit by contracting unpopular loans from Russia, which exacted political concessions in return.
