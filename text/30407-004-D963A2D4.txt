Vicente Blasco Ibáñez,  (born Jan. 29, 1867, Valencia, Spain—died  Jan. 28, 1928, Menton, Fr.) Spanish writer and politician, who achieved world renown for his novels dealing with World War I, the most famous of which, Los cuatro jinetes del Apocalipsis (1916; The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, 1918), was used as the basis for two U.S. films. He was associated with the Generation of ’98.
At the age of 18, while studying law at Madrid and contributing articles to political journals, Blasco Ibáñez wrote an antimonarchist poem for which he was sent to prison—the first of many such punishments for his political beliefs. He founded the republican journal El Pueblo in 1891 and was first elected to the Cortes (parliament) in 1901, to which he was returned seven times before he voluntarily exiled himself in 1923 and settled on the French Riviera. He did so because of his opposition to the military dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera.
