Coevolution, the process of reciprocal evolutionary change that occurs between pairs of species or among groups of species as they interact with one another. The activity of each species that participates in the interaction applies selection pressure to the others. In a predator-prey interaction, for example, the emergence of faster prey may select against individuals in the predatory species who are unable to keep pace. Thus, only fast individuals or those with adaptations allowing them to capture prey using other means will pass their genes to the next generation. Coevolution is one of the primary methods by which biological communities are organized. It can lead to very specialized relationships between species, such as those between pollinator and plant and between parasite and host. It may also foster the evolution of new species in cases where individual populations of interacting species separate themselves from their greater metapopulations for long periods of time.
How an interaction coevolves between species depends not only on the current genetic makeup of the species involved but also on new mutations that arise, the population characteristics of each species, and the community context in which the interaction takes place. Under some ecological conditions (such as in some predator-prey interactions or between competitors for a resource), an antagonistic interaction between two species can coevolve to enhance the antagonism; the species “build up” methods of defense and attack, much like an evolutionary arms race. Under other ecological conditions (such as in certain parasite-host interactions), however, the antagonism may be lessened.
