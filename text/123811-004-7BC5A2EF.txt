Eclogite, any member of a small group of igneous and metamorphic rocks whose composition is similar to that of basalt. Eclogites consist primarily of green pyroxene (omphacite) and red garnet (pyrope), with small amounts of various other stable minerals—e.g., rutile. They are formed when volcanic or metamorphic rocks rich in such mafic minerals are subjected to extremely high pressures and moderate to relatively high temperatures. Laboratory experiments have revealed that eclogites will crystallize from basaltic magma under very high pressure conditions common to the deeper portions of the Earth’s upper mantle, the mantle constituting the layer that lies between the crust and core and that comprises about two-thirds of the planet’s bulk. These conditions are found in subduction zones where the ocean floor is forced beneath a continental margin—such as in the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of western North America and the Sunda Trench subduction zone off the western coast of Sumatra, Indon. Many investigators believe that eclogite is representative of numerous parts of the upper mantle. In the crust, eclogites generally occur as xenoliths (i.e., foreign inclusions) in igneous rocks and as isolated blocks measuring as much as 100 m (328 feet) across in metamorphic rocks. Interestingly, eclogites somewhat resemble chondritic meteorites in composition (see chondrite).
