Kamehameha I, original name Paiea, byname Kamehameha the Great  (born November 1758?, Kohala district, Hawaii island—died  May 8, 1819, Kailua) Hawaiian conqueror and king who, by 1810, had united all the Hawaiian islands and founded the Kamehameha dynasty, the most enduring and best-documented line of Hawaiian rulers.
First named Paiea, meaning “Hard-Shelled Crab,” the future sovereign was the son of Keoua, a high chief, and of Kekuiapoiwa, a daughter of the former king Alapai. A Hawaiian tradition tells that a bright star, Kokoiki, appeared just before the great conqueror was born. The date of the legend coincides with the appearance of Halley’s Comet in 1758. When Kokoiki was viewed by the kahunas, Hawaii’s mystic seers, it was prophesied that a great leader was about to be born who would defeat all his rivals and reign supreme over all the islands. The infant prince was ordered to be put to death by Alapai but was reared secretly and grew to manhood, taking the name Kamehameha, meaning “The Very Lonely One,” or “The One Set Apart.”
