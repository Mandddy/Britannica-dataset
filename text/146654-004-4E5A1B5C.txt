Amtrak, formally National Railroad Passenger Corporation,  federally supported corporation that operates nearly all intercity passenger trains in the United States. It was established by the U.S. Congress in 1970 and assumed control of passenger service from the countryâ€™s private rail companies the following year. Virtually all railways, with the exception of a small handful, signed contracts with Amtrak. The corporation pays the railroads to run their passenger trains and also compensates them for the use of certain facilities, including tracks and terminals. It bears all administrative costs, such as those incurred for the purchase of new equipment, and manages scheduling, route planning, and the sale of tickets.
Amtrak was founded to relieve American railroads of the financial burden of providing passenger service and to improve the quality of that service. Since about the early 1960s, the railroads had lost millions of dollars annually on their passenger lines as a result of a steady decline in their ridership and increases in their operating costs. In order to avert further losses, many of the companies dropped their unprofitable routes. In 1950 there were approximately 9,000 passenger trains in service, which carried just under 50 percent of all intercity traffic. By 1970, however, there were only about 450 trains still in operation, with a total share of the passenger traffic amounting to a mere 7 percent.
