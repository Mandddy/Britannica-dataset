John II Comnenus , Comnenus also spelled Komnenos  (born September 13, 1087—died April 8, 1143) Byzantine emperor (1118–43) whose reign was characterized by unremitting attempts to reconquer all important Byzantine territory lost to the Arabs, Turks, and Christian Crusaders.
A son of Emperor Alexius I Comnenus and Irene Ducas, John kept an austere court and spent most of his reign with his troops. He canceled Venetian trading privileges granted by his father but was forced to restore them after the Venetians launched a fleet against him. He thwarted Pecheneg, Hungarian, and Serbian threats during the 1120s, and in 1130 he allied himself with the German emperor Lothar II (III) against the Norman king Roger II of Sicily.
