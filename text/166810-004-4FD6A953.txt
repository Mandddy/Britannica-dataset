Gloria Vanderbilt, in full Gloria Laura Morgan Vanderbilt  (born February 20, 1924, New York, New York, U.S.) American socialite, artist, author, actress, and designer of textiles and fashion who was often in the public eye for her social life and professional exploits.
Born into the prominent Vanderbilt family of New York, Gloria was thrust into the media spotlight from the moment of her birth. Her father died when she was a baby, and she spent much of her early childhood in Paris. At age 10 she became the centre of an highly publicized custody case between her mother and her aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who had been housing young Gloria on her New York estate for some two years. Gloria was eventually given to the care of her aunt, with her mother having visitation rights. It was through her auntâ€™s influence that Gloria first became interested in art; Whitney herself was a sculptor and the founder of the Whitney Museum of American Art.
