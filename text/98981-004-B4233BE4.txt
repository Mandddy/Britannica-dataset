Alma Gluck, original name Reba Fiersohn  (born May 11, 1884, Iaşi, Rom.—died Oct. 27, 1938, New York, N.Y., U.S.)  Romanian-born American singer whose considerable repertoire, performance skills, and presence made her one of the most sought-after recital performers of her day.
Fiersohn grew up on the Lower East Side of New York City and then worked as a stenographer until her marriage in 1902 to Bernard Glick. After having studied voice for just three years, in 1909 she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. There, under the name Alma Gluck, she performed the role of Sophie in Jules Massenet’s Werther. Over the next three years she sang a wide variety of lyric soprano roles, but opera apparently proved less interesting to her than the recital stage. In 1912 she left the opera stage, divorced her husband, and went to Europe to study. In London in 1914 she married the violinist Efrem Zimbalist.
