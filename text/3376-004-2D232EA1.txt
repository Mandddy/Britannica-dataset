Paraguay River, Portuguese Rio Paraguai, Spanish Río Paraguay ,  the fifth largest river in South America and the principal tributary of the Paraná River. Rising in the Mato Grosso region of Brazil at 980 feet (300 metres) above sea level, it crosses Paraguay to its confluence with the Paraná near the Argentine border. It is 1,584 miles (2,550 km) long. See also Plata, Río de la.
The source and upper course of the Paraguay River are in Brazil, where it demarcates part of the frontier with Paraguay before entering Paraguay itself, which it traverses from north to south. It then forms the frontier between Paraguay and Argentina for the last 150 miles (240 km) of its course before joining the Alto (Upper) Paraná River, the combined river then flowing into Argentina as the lower Paraná River.
