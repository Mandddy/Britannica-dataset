Emil Berliner,  Emil also spelled Emile   (born May 20, 1851, Hannover, Hanover [Germany]â€”died  Aug. 3, 1929, Washington, D.C., U.S.) German-born American inventor who made important contributions to telephone technology and developed the phonograph record disc.
Berliner immigrated to the United States in 1870. In 1877, a year after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, Berliner developed a transmitter employing a loose metal contact and, while experimenting with it, made the important discovery that the device could act as a superior telephone receiver.
