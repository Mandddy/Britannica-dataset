Bowline, knot forming a loop at the end of a rope, used for mooring boats, hoisting, hauling, and fastening one rope to another. It will not slip or jam, even under strain, but can be easily loosened by pushing with a finger.
A bowline is made by laying the rope’s end over its standing part to form a bight over the end, then taking the end around behind the standing part and through the bight. The running bowline, formed by making a bowline over the rope’s standing part, is used to make a lasso. When used as a sling to raise or lower a person, the bowline on a bight, made by doubling the rope on itself, is more comfortable than a simple bowline.
