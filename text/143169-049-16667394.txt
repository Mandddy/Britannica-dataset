Crust–mantle model, postulation of conditions that would explain the phenomena observed about the crust, the mantle, and their interface. Many years ago, seismic evidence showed a discontinuity, called the Mohorovičić Discontinuity, anywhere from 3 to 60 kilometres (about 2 to 40 miles) beneath the Earth’s surface. The model used to explain this discontinuity and the nature of volcanic materials envisions a crust of lower density siliceous and aluminous material, such as granite, floating on a thick mantle made of denser siliceous and ferromagnesian material, principally basalt–dunite–eclogite.
Studies of the loci of shallow- and deep-focus earthquakes have led to a crust–mantle model consisting of three layers: the lithosphere, the asthenosphere, and the mesosphere. The lithosphere is the crust and that part of the upper mantle that exhibit the same characteristics of rigidity, or approximately the upper 70 to 100 km of the Earth. It is a complex region of heterogeneous composition, the top few kilometres of which are known in some detail but the lower part of which is subject to some conjecture.
