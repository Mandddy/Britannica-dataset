Gascony, French Gascogne,  historical and cultural region encompassing the southwestern French départements of Landes, Gers, and Hautes-Pyrénées and parts of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, Lot-et-Garonne, Tarn-et-Garonne, Haute-Garonne, and Ariège and coextensive with the historical region of Gascony.
During ancient Roman rule in Gaul, the area, which was ethnically more Iberian than Celtic, was detached from Aquitania to form the separate province of Novempopulana. Taken from the Visigoths by the Franks after the Battle of Vouillé (507), the region was overrun from 561 by the Basques, or Vascones; in 602 the Frankish kings recognized Vasconia, or Gascony, as a duchy under the national leader Genialis. In the latter half of the 7th century, the Gascon duke Loup (Lupus) extended his power over adjacent areas, and by the latter half of the 10th century his successors controlled all of Gascony as well as Bordeaux, Bazadais, and Agenais (now Agen).
