Cuanza River, also spelled Coanza, Kuanza, Kwanza, or Quanza,  river in central Angola, rising about 50 miles (80 km) southeast of Chitembo on the Bié Plateau at an elevation of 5,000 feet (1,500 metres). It flows northward for about 320 miles (510 km) and then curves westward to enter the Atlantic Ocean 30 miles (50 km) south of Luanda after a course of 600 miles (960 km). The Cuanza drains much of central Angola and is the only Angolan river of economic significance. During much of its upper and middle course, the Cuanza is broken at intervals by rapids and flows in a well-defined valley. The lowest fall is that at Cambambe (about 70 feet [20 metres]), below which the river is navigable by small steamers to the sea, about 160 miles (255 km) distant. But the Cuanza is little used for transportation because of its shallowness in the dry season and because of a shifting sandbar at its mouth; moreover, much of the river’s basin is served by the Luanda-Malanje railway. A right-bank tributary of the Cuanza, the Lucala, is also navigable and is noted for a 330-foot (100-metre) waterfall along its course. Cambambe Dam (1963) supplies electricity to the Angolan capital of Luanda and provides irrigation water for the valley of the Cuanza in its lower course.
