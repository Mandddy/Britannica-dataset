Ebolavirus, genus of viruses in the family Filoviridae, certain members of which are particularly fatal in humans and nonhuman primates. In humans, ebolaviruses are responsible for Ebola virus disease (EVD), an illness characterized primarily by fever, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and hemorrhaging. The name given to the viruses and the disease they cause is derived from the Ebola River, a tributary of the Congo River in central Africa, where the majority of EVD epidemics have occurred. The most severe outbreak on record was the Ebola outbreak of 2014, which devastated communities in western Africa, however. There are five species of ebolaviruses: Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Taï Forest ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, and Bundibugyo ebolavirus. The viruses representative of those species are commonly referred to as Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Taï Forest virus (TAFV), Reston virus (RESTV), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), respectively.
Ebolaviruses are typical filoviruses, having filamentous (threadlike) virion particles, sometimes branching, circular, rod-shaped, or U-shaped in form. Virions measure about 80 nanometres in diameter and are tubular, with their central channel housing a helical nucleocapsid, which contains the negative-strand RNA ebolavirus genome. Surrounding the nucleocapsid is an outer lipid envelope made from the membrane of the host cell. The virion’s outer surface is covered with globular spikes, which are formed from glycoprotein, one of the virion’s seven structural proteins and the only one of its proteins to be expressed on the outer surface. Glycoprotein allows the virion to attach to a receptor on the host cell surface and thereby fuse with the host cell membrane, leading to infection. The ebolavirus genome is approximately 19 kilobases in length.
