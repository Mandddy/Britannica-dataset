Bruno Peyron, in full Bruno Tristan Peyron  (born November 10, 1955, Angers, France) French yachtsman who set a number of sailing records and was a three-time winner (1993, 2002, 2005) of the Jules Verne Trophy for the fastest trip around the world under sail.
Peyron, who was the oldest of two nautical world-champion brothers, was raised in La Baule in southern Brittany’s Loire Valley. As a young child, he fell in love with the ocean when his father and mentor, an oil-tanker captain, taught him to sail. As a teenager, Peyron began pursuing a lifelong goal: “to break every speed record on all the oceans of the world.” He soon matured into a regularly honoured sailor on the international offshore multihull racing circuit.
