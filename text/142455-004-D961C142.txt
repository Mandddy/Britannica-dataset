Guarino Guarini, also called Camillo Guarini   (born January 17, 1624, Modena, Duchy of Modena [Italy]—died March 6, 1683, Milan) Italian architect, priest, mathematician, and theologian whose designs and books on architecture made him a major source for later Baroque architects in central Europe and northern Italy.
Guarini was in Rome during 1639–47, when Francesco Borromini was most active. Later he taught in Modena, Messina, and Paris and finally in 1666 went to Turin, where he stayed for the greater part of the remainder of his life. While in Turin in the service of the dukes of Savoy, Guarini built (or furnished designs for) at least six churches and chapels, five palaces, and a city gate; published six books, two on architecture and four on mathematics and astronomy; and sent palace designs to the duke of Bavaria and the margrave of Baden.
