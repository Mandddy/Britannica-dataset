Sargassum, also called gulfweed,  genus of brown algae (150 species) generally attached to rocks along coasts in temperate regions. The Sargasso Sea is characterized by a free-floating mass of seaweed, predominately S. natans and S. fluitans, in the western Atlantic Ocean.
Sargassum is also known as sea holly because of its highly branched thallus with hollow, berrylike floats (pneumatocysts) and many leaflike sawtooth-edged blades. It is used as fertilizer in New Zealand. Most species reproduce sexually, but S. natans reproduces only by fragmentation.
