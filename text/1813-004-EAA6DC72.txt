Albert Sidney Johnston,  (born February 2, 1803, Washington, Kentucky, U.S.—died April 6, 1862, Shiloh, Tennessee) commander of the Confederate forces in the Western theatre during the early stages of the American Civil War (1861–65). His battlefield death was considered an irreparable loss by the South. He was the highest-ranking soldier on either side to die in battle during the war.
Johnston grew up in the small but thriving frontier town of Washington, Kentucky. His father, who enjoyed a successful practice as one of the area’s few physicians, had relocated his family there from New England. After studying at private schools, Johnston matriculated at age 15 in nearby Lexington at Transylvania University, which operated one of the foremost medical schools in the country before the Civil War. There he was a conscientious student. In 1821–22 Johnston altered his career path from medicine to the military and gained appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he befriended future Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Once again he excelled in his studies, graduating eighth in a class of 41 cadets in 1826.
