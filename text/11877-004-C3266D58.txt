Wood mouse (genus Apodemus), any of about 20 species of small-bodied rodents found from northern Europe eastward to southern China and the Himalayas. Body size varies; different species weigh from 15 to 50 grams (0.5 to 1.8 ounces) and measure from 6 to 15 cm (2.4 to 5.9 inches) long excluding the tail, which is either about as long as the head and body or much shorter. Wood mice have soft fur that is yellowish brown or gray; the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) has a narrow black stripe down its back.
Wood mice inhabit forests, grasslands, and cultivated fields. They generally live in burrows and build nests of grass and other plants, but during harsh seasons they will move into buildings. Their diet includes seeds, roots, fruit, and insects. Most wood mice are nocturnal and terrestrial; a few, including the striped field mouse, are active during the day, and some, particularly the Japanese wood mouse (A. argenteus), are agile climbers. The long-tailed field mouse (A. sylvaticus) is one of the most intensively studied species in the genus. In Europe it ranges north to Scandinavia and east to Ukraine. This wood mouse is also found in North Africa and on many islands. Once considered indigenous to Iceland, it was probably introduced by European settlers in the 10th and 11th centuries.
