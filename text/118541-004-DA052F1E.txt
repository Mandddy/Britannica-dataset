Janissary music, also called Turkish music,  in a narrow sense, the music of the Turkish military establishment, particularly of the Janissaries, an elite corps of royal bodyguards (disbanded 1826); in a broad sense, a particular repertory of European music the military aspect of which derives from conscious imitation of the music of the Janissaries.
Characteristic of Janissary music is its use of a great variety of drums and bells and the combination of bass drum, triangle, and cymbals. Janissary music probably appeared in Europe for the first time in 1720, when it was adopted by the army of the Polish ruler Augustus II. The novel clangour of its colourful instruments led to their wide use throughout Europe, where they became an integral part of the thrilling military spectacle. Throughout the 18th century they were occasionally used in opera scores—for example, Christoph Gluck’s Le Recontre imprévue (1764; “The Unexpected Encounter”) and W.A. Mozart’s The Abduction from the Seraglio (1782)—because of their exotic colour.
