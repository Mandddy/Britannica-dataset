Stenka Razin, byname of Stepan Timofeyevich Razin   (born c. 1630, Zimoveyskaya-na-Donu, Russia—died  June 16 [June 6, Old Style], 1671, Moscow) leader of a major Cossack and peasant rebellion on Russia’s southeastern frontier (1670–71).
Born into a well-to-do Don Cossack family, Stenka Razin grew up amid the tension caused by the inability of runaway serfs, who were continually escaping from Poland and Russia to the Don Cossack area, to find land and comfortably settle in the prosperous Cossack communities.
