Hornbill (family Bucerotidae), any of approximately 60 species of Old World tropical birds constituting the family Bucerotidae (order Coraciiformes). They are noted for the presence, in a few species, of a bony casque, or helmet, surmounting the prominent bill. They are typically large-headed, with thin necks, broad wings, and long tails. The plumage is brown or black, usually with bold white markings.
Hornbills range in size from 40 cm (16 inches), in the smaller Tockus species, to 160 cm (63 inches), in the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis). Several species, including the striking Rhinoceros hornbill (B. rhinoceros), possess a brightly coloured beak and casque. This striking coloration is the result of the birdâ€™s rubbing its beak and casque against the preen gland beneath the tail, which stimulates the production of an oily orange-red fluid that adds a reddish tone to these parts.
