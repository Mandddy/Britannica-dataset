Stand-up comedy, comedy that generally is delivered by a solo performer speaking directly to the audience in some semblance of a spontaneous manner.
Stand-up, at least in the form it is known today, is a fairly recent entertainment phenomenon. In the United States, where it developed first and reached its greatest popularity, it had its origins in the comic lecturers, such as Mark Twain, who toured the country in the 19th century. It began to emerge as populist entertainment in vaudeville in the early decades of the 20th century. While comedy was a staple of every vaudeville bill, it most often took the form of packaged routines delivered by comedy teams (who spoke to each other, not to the audience). But a few performers, such as Frank Fay, became known for their facility at off-the-cuff patter while serving as emcees in vaudeville houses such as the famed Palace Theatre in New York City. This solo style was honed further in the resorts of the Catskill Mountains region of New York in the 1930s and ’40s. The predominantly Jewish comedians of the so-called Borscht Belt developed a brash gag-filled monologue style that played on familiar comic tropes—the bossy mother-in-law, the henpecked husband—exemplified by Henny Youngman’s famous line “Take my wife—please.”
