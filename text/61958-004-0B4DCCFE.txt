Chester Himes, in full Chester Bomar Himes   (born July 29, 1909, Jefferson City, Mo., U.S.—died  Nov. 12, 1984, Moraira, Spain) African-American writer whose novels reflect his encounters with racism. As an expatriate in Paris, he published a series of black detective novels.
The domination of his dark-skinned father by his light-skinned mother was a source of deep resentment that shaped Himes’s racial outlook. The family’s frequent relocations, as well as the accidental blinding of his brother, further disrupted his childhood. Himes attended Ohio State University. From 1929 to 1936 he was jailed at the Ohio State Penitentiary for armed robbery, and while there he began to write fiction. A number of his stories appeared in Esquire and other American magazines. After his release from prison, he worked at numerous odd jobs and joined the Works Progress Administration, eventually serving as a writer with the Ohio Writers’ Project.
