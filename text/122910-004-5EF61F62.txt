Spring peeper, (species Pseudacris crucifer), small tree frog (family Hylidae) found in woodland areas in the eastern United States and Canada. Outside of the breeding season, when it may be found in ephemeral woodland ponds, it is seldom seen.
The spring peeper, with its high, whistling call, is one of the first frogs to vocalize and breed in spring. Larvae metamorphose into tiny froglets in two to three months. It is grayish, tan, or olive brown with an X-shaped, often irregular, brown mark on its back, and it grows to a length of about 2 to 3.5 cm (0.75 to 1.3 inches).
