Seth Rogen,  (born April 15, 1982, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) Canadian comic actor and screenwriter who won over audiences as a charismatic buffoon in a number of box-office hits, including Knocked Up (2007).
Rogen was born to liberal Jewish parents. At age 13 he began doing stand-up on the local comedy-club circuit alongside performers more than twice his age, and three years later he auditioned for the American high-school television dramedy Freaks and Geeks, winning the role of the sardonic Ken. The series proved to be short-lived, but producer Judd Apatow was impressed by Rogen’s ease in front of the camera and talent for improvisation and in 2001 hired him as both an actor and a writer on a new college-themed sitcom, Undeclared. When that show met a similar fate, Rogen, along with childhood friend Evan Goldberg, landed jobs writing for the Sacha Baron Cohen showcase Da Ali G Show. Rogen also surfaced in an episode of the teen-centred drama Dawson’s Creek.
