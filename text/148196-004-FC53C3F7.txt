Sibling, typically, a brother or a sister. Many societies choose not to differentiate children who have both parents in common from those who share only one parent; all are known simply as siblings. In those societies that do differentiate children on this basis, the former are known as full siblings, and the latter are known as half-siblings. Siblings may be the biological offspring of their parents, or they may be socially classified as such through adoption or the categories used in various descent systems. For instance, in some societies the relationships between certain sets of cousins (most often parallel cousins, the children of one’s mother’s sister or father’s brother) may be the same as those that other forms of reckoning expect between biological siblings. In European and related traditions, the study of child development has included sibling relationships as important factors in personality formation. In many traditional cultures, the rights and obligations that obtain between full siblings are among the most sacrosanct of all the ties that bind kinship groups together.
