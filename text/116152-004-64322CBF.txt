Tampa, city, seat (1834) of Hillsborough county, west-central Florida, U.S. It is situated on the northern shore of Tampa Bay at the mouth of the Hillsborough River and is connected to St. Petersburg and Clearwater (southwest and west) across the bay’s western arm (Old Tampa Bay) by the Gandy and Howard Frankland bridges and the Courtney Campbell Causeway. The three cities form one of Florida’s largest metropolitan areas.
Calusa and Timucua peoples (later replaced by the Seminoles) were early inhabitants of the area, which was visited by the Spanish explorers Pánfilo de Narváez (1528) and Hernando de Soto (1539). Settlement of Tampa began with Fort Brooke, established in 1824 to oversee the Seminoles. During the American Civil War the Confederates yielded the fort after bombardment by Union gunboats. Henry B. Plant’s South Florida Railroad arrived in 1884 and stimulated population growth and new industry. Plant developed port facilities extensively and promoted tourism, building the lavish, Moorish-style Tampa Bay Hotel in 1891. Cigar manufacturing was introduced in 1886 by Vicente Martinez Ybor, and Ybor City, Tampa’s Latin quarter, became a centre of that industry; although some cigars are still made in Ybor City, the enclave is now mainly a tourist spot.
