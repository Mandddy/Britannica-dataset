Killifish, also called egg-laying topminnow,  any of a few hundred species of usually elongated fishes of the family Cyprinodontidae (order Atheriniformes), found worldwide, especially in the tropics of Africa and the New World. They inhabit brackish, salt, and fresh water, including certain desert hot springs. Killifish grow, at most, to a length of about 15 cm (6 inches); many are much smaller. They are surface feeders, taking either plant or animal material.
All killifish lay eggs, unlike the live-bearing topminnows of the related family Poeciliidae (see live-bearer). Certain South American and African killifish live in pools subject to an annual drying out and bury their eggs in the bottom, where they remain dormant until water refills the pond. These fishes are called annual fishes because their life cycle from birth to mating and subsequent death usually does not exceed one year.
