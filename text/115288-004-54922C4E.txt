River Derwent, river in Tasmania, Australia, rising in Lake St. Clair on the central plateau and flowing 113 miles (182 km) southeast to enter Storm Bay through a 3.5-mile- (5.5-km-) wide estuary. Its major upper-course tributaries, the Jordan, Clyde, Ouse (now draining the Great Lake), and Dee, are extensively developed for hydropower. Hops are grown on irrigated alluvial terraces along its middle course, while in the rich farming area around New Norfolk are many fruit orchards. The city of Hobart is situated on the estuary, 12 miles (19 km) from the river’s mouth. This stretch of the river forms an excellent deepwater port and is spanned by the Tasman and other bridges. The river was sighted and named Rivière du Nord by the French admiral Bruni d’Entrecasteaux in 1793 but soon was renamed after the River Derwent in England.
