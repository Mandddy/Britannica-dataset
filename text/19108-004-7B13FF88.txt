Lillian D. Wald,  (born March 10, 1867, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died Sept. 1, 1940, Westport, Conn.) American nurse and social worker who founded the internationally known Henry Street Settlement in New York City (1893).
Wald grew up in her native Cincinnati, Ohio, and in Rochester, New York. She was educated in a private school, and after abandoning a plan to attend Vassar College she passed a few years enjoying an active social life. In 1889 she broke completely with that life and entered the New York Hospital Training School for Nurses, from which she graduated in 1891. For a year she worked as a nurse in the New York Juvenile Asylum. She supplemented her training in 1892–93 with courses at the Woman’s Medical College. She was asked to organize a class in home nursing for the poor immigrant families of New York’s Lower East Side, and in the course of that work she observed firsthand the wretched conditions within the tenement districts.
