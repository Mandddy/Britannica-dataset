Fernando Collor de Mello, in full Fernando Affonso Collor de Mello  (born August 12, 1949, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) Brazilian politician who served as president of Brazil (1990–92).
Born into wealth, Collor de Mello became governor of the small state of Alagoas in 1987. Promising to promote economic growth and combat corruption and inefficiency, Collor de Mello defeated the leftist politician Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 1989 to become Brazil’s first popularly elected president in nearly 30 years. The country’s economic decline, fueled by a staggering foreign debt and hyperinflation, failed to improve. Moreover, Collor de Mello was accused of corruption, and he resigned in 1992 as his trial was about to begin. He was convicted and barred from holding public office for a period of eight years. In 2002 he ran unsuccessfully for the governorship of Alagoas. Four years later he was elected to the Brazilian Senate representing that state.
