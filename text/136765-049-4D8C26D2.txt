Georges-Marie Guynemer,  (born Dec. 24, 1894, Paris, France—died Sept. 11, 1917, near Poelcapelle, Belg.) one of the most renowned combat pilots of World War I and France’s first great fighter ace.
Guynemer was educated at the Lycée Stanislas and developed an early interest in aeronautics. Nevertheless, on the outbreak of World War I he tried unsuccessfully to join first the infantry and then the cavalry. Finally, he enlisted in the air service as a student mechanic. Later he was accepted as a pilot trainee (making his first flight on Feb. 17, 1915), and, after he received his pilot’s certificate, he joined the M.S.3 Squadron (Les Cigognes, meaning “the storks”) as a corporal pilot. He remained with this squadron for the rest of his short life, flying successively Morane-Saulnier two-seaters, Nieuport single-seaters, and Spad fighters. Although a frail youth suffering from tuberculosis, he was credited with 53 air victories and was shot down 8 times before his death in combat in 1917.
