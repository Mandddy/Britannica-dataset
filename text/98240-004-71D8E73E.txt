Multinational corporation (MNC),  also called transnational corporation,  any corporation that is registered and operates in more than one country at a time. Generally the corporation has its headquarters in one country and operates wholly or partially owned subsidiaries in other countries. Its subsidiaries report to the corporation’s central headquarters.
In economic terms, a firm’s advantages in establishing a multinational corporation include both vertical and horizontal economies of scale (i.e., reductions in cost that result from an expanded level of output and a consolidation of management) and an increased market share. Although cultural barriers can create unpredictable obstacles as companies establish offices and production plants around the world, a firm’s technical expertise, experienced personnel, and proven strategies usually can be transferred from country to country. Critics of the multinational corporation usually view it as an economic and, often, political means of foreign domination. Developing countries, with a narrow range of exports (often of primary goods) as their economic base, are particularly vulnerable to economic exploitation. Monopolistic practices, human-rights abuses, and disruption of more-traditional means of economic growth are among the risks that face host countries.
