Abe Attell, byname the Little Champ   (born February 22, 1884, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died February 7, 1970, New Paltz, New York) American professional boxer, undisputed world featherweight champion from 1906 through 1912. Attell was from a poor Jewish family and began his boxing career at 15 as a means of supplementing the family’s income.
In his first 32 bouts he was victorious 31 times (24 by knockout) and fought to 1 draw. Attell first claimed the vacant featherweight championship on October 28, 1901, after outpointing George Dixon in 15 rounds, although his right to the title was not universally accepted. Eight days before this fight Attell and Dixon had fought to a 20-round draw in a title match.
