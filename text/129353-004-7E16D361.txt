New South Wales, state of southeastern Australia, occupying both coastal mountains and interior tablelands. It is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the east and the states of Victoria to the south, South Australia to the west, and Queensland to the north. New South Wales also includes Lord Howe Island, 360 miles (580 km) east of the continent. The state capital is Sydney, the country’s largest city.
The site of the first British settlement in Australia in 1788, New South Wales is today the most populous and, after Victoria, the most industrialized state in the Commonwealth of Australia. Originally the name New South Wales was applied to all territory east of longitude 135° E. The colonies of Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, and Queensland were successively carved out of its territory in the 19th century. The Australian Capital Territory at Canberra was ceded to the Commonwealth government in 1911, and the Jervis Bay enclave on the Pacific coast was similarly ceded in 1915 to provide a port for Canberra.
