Magnesite,  the mineral magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), a member of the calcite group of carbonate minerals that is a principal source of magnesium. The mineral has formed as an alteration product from magnesium-rich rocks or through the action of magnesium-containing solutions upon calcite. Notable deposits are those at Radenthein, Austria; the Liaotung Peninsula, Liaoning Province, China; and Clark County, Nev., U.S. Iron is usually present, and a complete chemical substitution series exists between magnesite and siderite in which iron replaces magnesium. Magnesite is used as a refractory material, a catalyst and filler in the production of synthetic rubber, and a material in the preparation of magnesium chemicals and fertilizers. For detailed physical properties, see carbonate mineral (table).
