Yury Luzhkov, in full Yury Mikhaylovich Luzhkov  (born Sept. 21, 1936, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian politician who served as mayor of Moscow (1992–2010). As mayor, he transformed Moscow into the engine of post-Soviet state capitalism.
Luzhkov studied mechanical engineering at the Gubkin Academy of Oil and Gas in Moscow. After graduating in 1958, he was a junior scientist at the Research and Development Institute of Plastics. He subsequently worked at various positions of increasing stature in the chemical industry, and by 1986 he was head of the science and technology department of the Chemical Industry Ministry in Moscow. In 1987 he became first deputy chairman of the Moscow government. Three years later, he rose to the position of executive committee leader under Mayor Gavril Popov, and he became deputy mayor when Popov was reelected in 1991. Popov’s resignation in June 1992 prompted Russian Pres. Boris Yeltsin to name Luzhkov the new mayor.
