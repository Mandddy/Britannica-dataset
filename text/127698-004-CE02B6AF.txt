Kenai Fjords National Park, rugged wilderness area in southern Alaska, U.S., on the southern coast of Kenai Peninsula just west and southwest of Seward. Proclaimed a national monument in 1978, it became a national park in 1980. Its area is 1,047 square miles (2,712 square km).
The park includes the 300-square-mile (777-square-km) Harding Icefield and its outflowing glaciers and numerous coastal fjords and islands, which are remnants of drowned mountains. Eight of the ice fieldâ€™s outflowing glaciers reach the sea and calve icebergs into the fjords. Alpine vegetation is found at high elevations nearest the glaciers, and a narrow belt of hemlock and spruce forest occurs along the fjords between the glaciers and the sea. Sea lions, sea otters, seals, and tens of thousands of breeding birds, including puffins, murres, and auklets, live along the fjords. The nontidewater Exit Glacier near Seward is accessible by road, and trails lead to it and to the Harding Icefield to the southwest. The fjords can be reached by boat or float plane.
