Coelacanth, any of the lobe-finned bony fishes of the order Crossopterygii. Members of the related but extinct suborder Rhipidistia are considered to have been the ancestors of land vertebrates. In some systems of classification, the coelacanths and rhipidistians are considered separate orders, members of the subclass Crossopterygii.
Modern coelacanths belong to the family Latimeriidae. The name refers to their hollow fin spines (Greek: koilos, “hollow”; akantha, “spine”). The modern coelacanths are bigger than most fossil coelacanths and are powerful predators with heavy mucilaginous bodies and highly mobile limblike fins. They average 5 feet (1.5 metres) in length and weigh about 100 pounds (45 kg). They are live-bearers that give birth to well-developed young. Though once thought to be deep-water fishes, coelacanths are now known to inhabit mesopelagic waters, below the continental shelf, at some 650–1,300 feet (200–400 metres).
