Siege of Toulon, (Aug. 28–Dec. 19, 1793), military engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars, in which the young artillery officer Napoleon Bonaparte won his first military reputation by forcing the withdrawal of the Anglo-Spanish fleet, which was occupying the city of Toulon and its forts.
On August 27–28 French royalist counterrevolutionaries handed over this major French naval base and arsenal to an Anglo-Spanish fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Lord Hood and Admiral Juan de Lángara. The British fleet also seized more than 70 French ships, almost half of the French Navy. Both the strategic importance of the naval base and the prestige of the Revolution demanded that the French recapture Toulon. Both sides brought up reinforcements, and the siege began.
