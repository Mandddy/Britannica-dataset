Vicuña,  (Lama, or Vicugna, vicugna), South American member of the camel family, Camelidae (order Artiodactyla), that is closely related to the alpaca, guanaco, and llama (known collectively as lamoids). Depending on the authority, the llama, alpaca, and guanaco may be classified as distinct species of llama (Lama glama). Because of differences in the incisor teeth, however, some authorities place the vicuña in a separate genus, Vicugna. Most vicuñas inhabit Peru, with smaller numbers found in Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina.
The vicuña is covered with a remarkably long, fine, soft, and lustrous coat that varies in colour from light cinnamon to a pale white, with long white fleece hanging from the lower flanks and the base of the neck. The annual yield of fleece sheared from domesticated vicuñas shows a wide range of from 85 to 550 g (3 to 20 ounces) per animal. Vicuña fibre is strong and resilient, but it is highly sensitive to chemicals and is generally used in its natural colour. The costly fibre is made into high-priced coats, dressing gowns, and shawls.
