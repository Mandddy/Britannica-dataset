Sail, an extent of fabric (such as canvas) by means of which wind is used to propel a ship through water.
The first sails were most likely animal skins that were used to harness wind power for rafts or boats consisting of a single log. The next probable step was the use of woven reed mats stretched between poles. Depictions of cloth sails appear in predynastic (c. 3300 bc) Egyptian art, and ships from other early Mediterranean civilizations were equipped with sails.
