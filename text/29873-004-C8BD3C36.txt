Sir Walter Besant,  (born August 14, 1836, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England—died  June 9, 1901, London) English novelist and philanthropist, whose best work describing social evils in London’s East End helped set in motion movements to aid the poor.
From 1861 to 1867 Besant taught at the Royal College, Mauritius, and in 1868 he became secretary to the Palestine Exploration Fund. In 1871 he began a literary collaboration with James Rice, editor of Once a Week, which lasted until Rice’s death (1882). During that time they produced 14 romantic, improbable, and verbose novels.
