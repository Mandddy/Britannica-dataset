Sealyham terrier, breed of terrier developed during the latter half of the 19th century by Capt. John Edwardes for hunting foxes, otters, and badgers on his estate, Sealyham, in Wales. A small, short-legged, sturdy dog, the Sealyham was bred for courage, stamina, and hunting ability. It has a double coat, soft underneath and wiry on top, and may be solid white or white with darker markings on its head and on its drooping ears. The Sealyham stands about 10 inches (25 cm), with males weighing 23 to 25 pounds (10 to 11 kg) and females weighing slightly less.
