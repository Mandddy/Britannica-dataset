Aragonite, widespread mineral, the stable form of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) at high pressures. It may be distinguished from calcite, the commoner form of calcium carbonate, by its greater hardness and specific gravity. Aragonite is always found in deposits formed at low temperatures near the surface of the Earth, as in caves as stalactites, in the oxidized zone of ore minerals (with lead substituting for calcium), in serpentine and other basic rocks, in sediments, and in iron-ore deposits. Aragonite is the mineral normally found in pearls. It is polymorphous (same chemical formula but different crystal structure) with calcite and vaterite, and, with geologic time, probably inverts to calcite even under normal conditions. For detailed physical properties, see carbonate mineral (table).See Full Size
Aragonite is an important element in the shells and tests of many marine invertebrates. These animals can secrete the mineral from waters that would ordinarily yield only calcite; they do so by physiological mechanisms that are not fully understood.
