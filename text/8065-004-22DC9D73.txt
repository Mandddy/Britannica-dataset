Lambeosaurus (genus Lambeosaurus), duck-billed dinosaur (hadrosaur) notable for the hatchet-shaped hollow bony crest on top of its skull. Fossils of this herbivore date to the Late Cretaceous Period (99.6 million to 65.5 million years old) of North America. Lambeosaurus was first discovered in 1914 in the Oldman Formation, Alberta, Canada. These specimens measured about 9 metres (30 feet) long, but larger specimens up to 16.5 metres in length have been found recently in Baja California, Mexico. Lambeosaurus and related genera are members of the hadrosaur subgroup, Lambeosaurinae.
Several lambeosaurines possessed a range of bizarre cranial crests, and various functions for these crests have been proposed. For example, it has been suggested that the complex chamber extensions of the breathing passage between the nostrils and the trachea contained in the crest served as resonating chambers for producing sound or as expanded olfactory membranes to improve the sense of smell. Other proposed functions such as air storage, snorkeling, or combat have been dismissed for various reasons. No single function or suite of functions appears to fit all lambeosaurine crests, and it is possible that their strange shapes were mainly features by which members of different species recognized each other from members of other species. As in all other duck-billed dinosaurs, the dentition was expanded and adapted for chewing large quantities of harsh plant tissues.
