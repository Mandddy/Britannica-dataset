Choker,  in jewelry, necklace that fits closely around the neck like a snug, high collar. The choker became popular in the late 19th century, and its popularity has continued through the 20th.
The most common early form of choker had one or more rows of pearls, which sometimes covered the neck from the base to the chin. Another popular choker was a band of velvet with a cameo pinned to its centre. Queen Alexandra, consort to Edward VII of Great Britain, in the late 19th century introduced a wide pearl and diamond choker that was soon dubbed the “dog collar.”
