Gül Baba, also spelled Gülbaba  (born , Merzifon, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died Sept. 2, 1541, Buda [now in Budapest], Hung.) Turkish Bektashi dervish whose türbe (tomb) in Buda (part of present-day Budapest) became a Muslim place of pilgrimage.
Gül Baba arrived in Hungary in 1541 in the company of Süleyman I. According to 17th-century Turkish traveler and writer Evliya Çelebi, Baba died in Buda during the Turkish siege of the city. His coffin, as legend has it, was carried by Süleyman I himself. In 1543–48 the third pasha of Buda had a tomb built on Baba’s grave.
