Allosaurus (genus Allosaurus), subsumes Antrodemus ,  large carnivorous dinosaurs that lived from 150 million to 144 million years ago during the Late Jurassic Period; they are best known from fossils found in the western United States, particularly from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry in Utah and the Garden Park Quarry in Colorado.
Allosaurus weighed two tons and grew to 10.5 metres (35 feet) in length, although fossils indicate that some individuals could have reached 12 metres. Half the body length consisted of a well-developed tail, and Allosaurus, like all theropod dinosaurs, was a biped. It had very strong hind limbs and a massive pelvis with strongly forward- (anteriorly) and rearward- (posteriorly) directed projections. The forelimbs were considerably smaller than the hind limbs but not as small as those of tyrannosaurs. The forelimbs had three fingers ending in sharp claws and were probably used for grasping.
