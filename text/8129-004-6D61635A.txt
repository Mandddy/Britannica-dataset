Cairn terrier, working terrier breed developed in Scotland to rout vermin from cairns (rock piles). The modern breed’s characteristics are carefully patterned on those of the dog’s ancestor, a 17th-century terrier of the Isle of Skye. The cairn terrier is a short-legged dog with a short, broad face fixed in a “keen” expression that is typical of the breed. Its harsh coat is usually bluish gray, tan, or pale yellowish brown. Generally active, hardy, alert, and spirited, the cairn terrier is valued as a pet and watchdog. It stands 9.5 to 10 inches (24 to 25 cm) and weighs about 13 to 14 pounds (6 to 6.5 kg).
