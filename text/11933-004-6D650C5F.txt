Charles-Simon Favart,  (born Nov. 13, 1710, Paris—died  May 12, 1792, Belleville, Fr.) French dramatist and theatre director who was one of the creators of the opéra comique.
After his father’s death, Favart simultaneously carried on his business as a pastry cook and wrote librettos for light operas. He became stage manager of the Opéra-Comique in 1743 and director of the company in 1758. His insistence that individual characters be costumed in a manner historically appropriate to their personalities and station, rather than in contemporary style, was an innovation that other directors were quick to imitate.
