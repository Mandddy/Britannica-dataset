Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli,  (born 1700, Paris, Franceâ€”died April 1771, St. Petersburg, Russia) French-born inventor of an opulent Russian Baroque architecture that combined elements of Rococo with traditional elements of Russian architecture, producing multicoloured and decorative ornamentation on all facades.
Of Italian descent, Rastrelli moved to St. Petersburg in 1716 with his father, the sculptor Bartolomeo Carlo Rastrelli. During his first five years in Russia, he worked with his father decorating the interiors of the palaces of the Russian aristocracy. From 1721 he worked independently as an architect, and he immediately made a name for himself as a master with a rich imagination.
