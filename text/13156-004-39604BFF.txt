Bema,  (Greek bēma, “step”), raised platform; in antiquity it was probably made of stone, but in modern times it is usually a rectangular wooden platform approached by steps. Originally used in Athens as a tribunal from which orators addressed the citizens as well as the courts of law, the bema later became a standard fixture in Christian churches. In Early Christian basilicas it functioned as a stage for the seating of clergy, first in the chancel and later in the apse. The bema also appears in synagogues, and from it the Pentateuch and Torah are read. Rabbinical authorities disagree about its placement, however, and it has no fixed position.
