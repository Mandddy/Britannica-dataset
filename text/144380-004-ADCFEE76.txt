Elea, also spelled Hyele, Roman Velia,  ancient city in Lucania, Italy, about 25 miles southeast of Paestum; home of the Eleatic school of philosophers, including Parmenides and Zeno. The city was founded about 535 bc by Phocaean Greek refugees on land seized from the native Oenotrians. Unlike other Greek cities in Italy, Elea was never captured by the Lucanians; it became a Roman ally around 275 and a municipium in 90â€“89 bc. Elea, finally deserted in medieval times because of Arab raids, has extensive ruins that include sanctuaries, houses, the outline of the complete wall circuit, and a medical centre.
