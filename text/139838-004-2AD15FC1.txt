Cauca River, Spanish Río Cauca,  river, western and northwestern Colombia, rising in the Andes near Popayán and flowing northward between the Cordilleras (mountains) Occidental and Oriental for 838 mi (1,349 km) to join the Río Magdalena north of Mompós. In its middle reaches, the Cauca flows through the broad, fertile intermontane depression of the Valle del Cauca (where sugarcane, cacao, bananas, corn [maize], and rice are grown, and cattle are raised) at an elevation of 3,100–3,300 ft (940–1,000 m). Together with the adjacent uplands, the valley has been organized under a regional authority to promote balanced agricultural, commercial, and industrial development. Food, paper, and textile industries are important. The volcanic uplands produce two-thirds of Colombia’s coffee. The river is navigable by river steamers below Cáceres, Antioquia department.
