Mikhail Glinka, in full Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka  (born May 21 [June 1, New Style], 1804, Novospasskoye, Russia—died February 3 [February 15], 1857, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]) the first Russian composer to win international recognition, and the acknowledged founder of the Russian nationalist school.
Glinka first became interested in music at age 10 or 11, when he heard his uncle’s private orchestra. He studied at the Chief Pedagogic Institute at St. Petersburg (1818–22) and took piano lessons with the Irish pianist and composer John Field. He worked for four years in the Ministry of Communications but was uninterested in an official career. As a dilettante he composed songs and a certain amount of chamber music. Three years in Italy brought him under the spell of the composers Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti, though ultimately homesickness led him to the idea of writing music “in Russian.”
