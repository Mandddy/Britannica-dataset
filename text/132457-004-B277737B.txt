Saint Jean-Baptiste de La Salle,  (born April 30, 1651, Reims, France—died  April 7, 1719, Rouen; canonized 1900; feast day April 7) French educator and founder of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (sometimes called the de La Salle Brothers), the first Roman Catholic congregation of male nonclerics devoted solely to schools, learning, and teaching.
Of noble birth, La Salle was ordained priest in 1678 and devoted himself to education of the poor. He helped to establish charity schools in Reims and subsequently formed his teachers into a religious order (1680). He also set up boarding schools for middle-class boys, reformatories, and—for the first time—training colleges for secular teachers. In 1725 Pope Benedict XIII raised La Salle’s congregation to the status of a papal institute. Among his writings are Les Devoirs d’un chrétien (1703; “The Duties of a Christian”), two series of Méditations (1730–31), and La Conduite des écoles chrétiennes (1720; “The Conduct of Christian Schools”). He was declared patron saint of all schoolteachers by Pope Pius XII in 1950.
