Tina Brown, byname of Christina Hambley Brown  (born November 21, 1953, Maidenhead, England) English American magazine editor and writer whose exacting sensibilities and prescient understanding of popular culture were credited with revitalizing the sales of such publications as Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. She applied her media acumen to the online realm as editor of The Daily Beast, a newsmagazine launched in 2008.
Brown was raised in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England. Her father was a film producer and her mother a publicist. Obstreperous behaviour earned her ejection from several boarding schools. She ultimately enrolled at the University of Oxford at age 16. Majoring in English and writing for a student magazine at Oxford, Brown was drawn into the orbit of literary figures, among them Auberon Waugh, who secured publication of her writing in the weekly New Statesman. Brown graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in 1974 and began contributing to Punch magazine and the Sunday Times. She left the Times for the Sunday Telegraph after becoming involved with Times editor Harold Evans (they married in 1981).
