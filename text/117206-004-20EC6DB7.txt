Bristling, also spelled Brisling, also called Sprat,   (Sprattus sprattus), edible fish of the herring family Clupeidae (order Clupeiformes). Bristlings are silver-coloured marine fishes that form enormous schools in western European waters. They contribute to the worldwide fishing industry. They are smaller than Atlantic herrings (Clupea harengus), reaching a length of less than 15 cm (6 inches), and so are especially valuable for canning as sardines (a term applied to several small fishes of the family Clupeidae). They are eaten fresh, tinned in oil, pickled, or smoked.
