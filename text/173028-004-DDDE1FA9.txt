Osman Nuri Paşa,  (born 1832, Tokat, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died April 14, 1900, Constantinople [now Istanbul]) Ottoman pasha and muşir (field marshal) who became a national hero for his determined resistance at Plevna (modern Pleven, Bulgaria) during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78.
After graduation from the military academy of Constantinople, Osman entered the cavalry in 1853 and served in the Crimean War (1853–56). Later he took part in the campaigns in Lebanon (1860) and Crete (1866–69) and in the suppression of an insurrection in Yemen (1871). He was given command of an army corps at Vidin in 1876, and, following his successes against the Serbian army, he was promoted to the rank of muşir. During the Russo-Turkish War, after the Russians crossed the Danube in July 1877, Osman entrenched himself at Plevna, on the right flank of the Russian line of communications, and maintained his position until December 9, when, compelled to cut his way out, he was wounded and forced to capitulate. This famous defense earned him the title of gazi (“victor in the holy war”), and, after his return from imprisonment in Russia, he was appointed marshal of the sultan’s court. Later Osman served as war minister on four occasions.
