Originally, Tangshan was a small hamlet dependent upon nearby Kaiping and located in an area where many small coal pits had been worked since the 16th century. In 1876 a Cantonese promoter of Western-style industrialization proposed to the governor-general of what was then the province of Zhili that a coal industry be established there. The first shaft of the mine at Kaiping (Tangshan) was begun in 1879. The coal was taken by horse tramway to Xugezhuang (now Fengnan), 7 miles (11 km) away, whence it was carried by canal to Ninghe (Lutai) on the Jiyun River and thence shipped to a depot near Tianjin.
