Innocent VIII, original name Giovanni Battista Cibo   (born 1432, Genoaâ€”died  July 25/26, 1492, Rome) pope from 1484 to 1492.
Named bishop of Savona, Italy, in 1467 by Pope Paul II, he was made cardinal in 1473 by Pope Sixtus IV, whom he succeeded. His election was manipulated by Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (later Pope Julius II), whose tool Innocent remained. The executions of persons thought to be practicing witchcraft were increasing throughout western Europe. In a bull of 1484 Innocent acknowledged belief in witchcraft, condemned it, and then dispatched inquisitors to Germany to try witches. In 1486 he persecuted one of the chief exponents of Renaissance Platonism, Pico della Mirandola, by condemning his theses and prohibiting his defense.
