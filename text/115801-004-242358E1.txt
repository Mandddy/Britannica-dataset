Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, natural area in western Colorado, U.S., encompassing a deep, narrow gorge 15 miles (24 km) east of Montrose. It was established as a national monument in 1933 and was elevated to national park status in 1999; the park occupies an area of 47 square miles (122 square km). Curecanti National Recreation Area borders it to the southeast. The canyon was cut by the Gunnison River (named for the army engineer John W. Gunnison) and its tributaries. At the section where its walls are steepest, it is 10 miles (16 km) long with depths ranging from 1,730 to 2,425 feet (525 to 740 metres), while its rim width narrows to 1,300 feet (400 metres) and its floor width to 40 feet (12 metres).
The Black Canyon derives its name from its black-stained, lichen-covered walls, which accentuate the gloom of the chasm. Roads on the North and South rims, with overlooks and foot trails, reach about 8,000 feet (2,400 metres) above sea level. The South Rim, which is somewhat more accessible than the North, receives most of the park’s visitors. Block “islands” and pinnacles form the canyon’s most striking features. The Black Canyon is the habitat of mule deer, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, rock squirrels, and a wide variety of birds, including the golden and bald eagles. Most of the monument has a vegetation cover of Gambel oak and serviceberry.
