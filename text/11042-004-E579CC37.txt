Highland fling,  national dance of Scotland. A vigorous dance requiring delicate balance and precision, it was probably originally a victory dance for a solo male dancer, performed after battle. It is performed in 4/4 time and consists of a series of intricate steps performed on one spot. Especially characteristic is a light step in which the dancer hops on one foot while moving the other foot in front of and in back of the calf. The dance is regularly performed in competition at the Highland Games held throughout Scotland.
