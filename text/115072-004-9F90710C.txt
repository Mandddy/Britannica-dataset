Ray Bradbury, in full Ray Douglas Bradbury   (born August 22, 1920, Waukegan, Illinois, U.S.—died June 5, 2012, Los Angeles, California) American author best known for highly imaginative science-fiction short stories and novels that blend social criticism with an awareness of the hazards of runaway technology.
Bradbury published his first story in 1940 and was soon contributing widely to magazines. His first book of short stories, Dark Carnival (1947), was followed by The Martian Chronicles (1950), which is generally accounted a science-fiction classic in its depiction of materialistic Earthmen exploiting and corrupting an idyllic Martian civilization. Bradbury’s other important short-story collections include The Illustrated Man (1951), The Golden Apples of the Sun (1953), The October Country (1955), A Medicine for Melancholy (1959), The Machineries of Joy (1964), I Sing the Body Electric! (1969), and Quicker Than the Eye (1996). His novels include Fahrenheit 451 (1953; filmed 1966); Dandelion Wine (1957) and its sequel, Farewell Summer (2006); Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962; filmed 1983); and Death Is a Lonely Business (1985). He wrote stage plays, television scripts, and several screenplays, including Moby Dick (1956; in collaboration with John Huston). In the 1970s Bradbury wrote several volumes of poetry, and in the 1970s and ’80s he concentrated on writing children’s stories and crime fiction. His short stories were published in more than 700 anthologies. In 2007 the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded Bradbury a Special Citation for his distinguished career.
