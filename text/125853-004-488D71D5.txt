Comfrey,  any herb plant of the Eurasian genus Symphytum, of the family Boraginaceae, especially the medicinal common comfrey (S. officinale), used to treat wounds and a source of a gum for treatment of wool. The coiled sprays of comfrey blooms, which are bell-like, deeply parted, five-lobed, and hanging, are usually pollinated by bees.
Comfrey fruits are four oval nutlets. Common comfrey is about 90 centimetres (3 feet) tall, with winged, hairy stems and blue, purplish, or yellow flowers.
