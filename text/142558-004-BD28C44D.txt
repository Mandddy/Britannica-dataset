Beas River, Beas also spelled Bias, ancient Greek Hyphasis, Sanskrit Vipasha,  river in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab states, northwestern India. It is one of the five rivers that give the Punjab (“Five Rivers”) its name.
The Beas rises at an elevation of 14,308 feet (4,361 metres) at Rohtang Pass in the western (Punjab) Himalayas (a section of the vast Himalayas mountain range), in central Himachal Pradesh. From there it flows south through the Kullu Valley, receiving tributaries from the flanking mountains, and then turns west to flow past Mandi into the Kangra Valley. After crossing the valley, the Beas enters Punjab state and veers south and then southwest to its confluence with the Sutlej River at Harike after a course of about 290 miles (470 km). The Beas River was the approximate eastern limit of Alexander the Great’s invasion of India in 326 bce.
