Katharine Cornell,  (born Feb. 16, 1893, Berlin, Ger.—died June 9, 1974, Vineyard Haven, Martha’s Vineyard, Mass., U.S.) one of the most celebrated American stage actresses from the 1920s to the 1950s.
Cornell was the daughter of American parents who were in Berlin at the time of her birth. Later that year the family returned to Buffalo, New York. Her interest in the theatre came naturally—her father was an amateur actor and an associate in theatrical management of Jessie Bonstelle. Cornell wrote, directed, and appeared in several plays in school and then joined the Washington Square Players (1916–18) in New York City. She later worked with a touring stock company and in October 1919 received favourable attention for her portrayal of Jo in the first London production of Little Women. In March 1921 she made her Broadway debut in Rachel Crothers’s Nice People, and later in the year she won her first lead in Clemence Dane’s A Bill of Divorcement, vaulting into stardom with the role. Subsequently she appeared in Will Shakespeare (1923), George Bernard Shaw’s Candida (1924), and Michael Arlen’s The Green Hat (1925), among others. The Green Hat was directed by Guthrie McClintic, who was her husband from 1921 and thereafter the director of nearly all her plays.
