Willemite, white or greenish yellow silicate mineral, zinc silicate, Zn2SiO4, that is found as crystals, grains, or fibres with other zinc ores in many deposits. Included are various localities in Sussex County, New Jersey, where it occurs in crystalline limestone and constitutes an important zinc ore; it was worked at Nutley for more than 100 years before the reserve was exhausted in 1954. Occurrences outside the United States include Belgium, Algeria, Namibia, and Greenland. Its brilliant green fluorescence led to its use in early television tubes.
