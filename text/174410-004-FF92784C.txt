Randy Newman, in full Randall Stuart Newman  (born November 28, 1943, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) American composer, songwriter, singer, and pianist whose character-driven, ironic, and often humorous compositions won him a cult audience and praise from critics but were atypical of the singer-songwriter movement of the 1970s that gave him his start as a performer.
Born in Los Angeles but taken to New Orleans as an infant, Newman was still a young boy when his family returned to Los Angeles, where his uncle Emil Newman was a conductor and his uncles Lionel and Alfred Newman composed scores for motion pictures. He studied musical composition at the University of California at Los Angeles and worked as a staff songwriter for a publishing company.
