Audrey Hepburn, original name Edda Kathleen van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston (see Researcher’s Note)  (born May 4, 1929, Brussels, Belgium—died January 20, 1993, Tolochenaz, Switzerland) slender, stylish motion picture actress known for her radiant beauty, her ability to project an air of sophistication tempered by a charming innocence, and her tireless efforts to aid needy children.
Although born in Belgium, Hepburn had British citizenship and attended school in England as a child. In 1939, however, at the onset of World War II, her mother (Hepburn’s father left the family when she was six years old) moved the child to the Netherlands, thinking that neutral country safer than England. Throughout World War II, Hepburn endured hardships in Nazi-occupied Holland. She still managed, however, to attend school and take ballet lessons. After the war, she continued to study ballet in Amsterdam and in London. During her early 20s, she studied acting and worked as a model and dancer. She also began to get some small film roles.
