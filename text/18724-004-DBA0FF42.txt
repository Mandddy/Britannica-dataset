Carroll, county, eastern New Hampshire, U.S., bordered by Lake Winnipesaukee to the southwest, the White Mountains to the northwest, and Maine to the east. Mountain ranges include the Squam and Ossipee mountains and Robbins Ridge. The principal streams are the Saco, Ellis, Swift, Pine, and Ossipee rivers. Ossipee and Great East lakes and a portion of Squam Lake are among the county’s numerous lakes. The White Mountain National Forest occupies the northern arm of the county, while the Appalachian National Scenic Trail crosses Crawford Notch State Park in the northwest. Other public lands include Wentworth, White Lake, and Echo Lake state parks and Pine River and Hemenway state forests. A landmark is the Madison Boulder, one of the largest granite glacial erratics, measuring 83 feet (25 metres) tall and 37 feet (11 metres) wide. The county is largely forested with pine, maple, and birch, except for large stands of spruce and fir in the northwest. Carroll county contains several 19th-century covered truss bridges.
The local Abenaki Indian tribe was the Sokoki, which included the Ossipee and the Pequawket. Ossipee (the county seat), Moultonboro, and Madison all were colonial farming communities. Other agricultural towns—such as Conway, Wolfeboro, Wakefield, and Center Sandwich—were formed in the mid-18th century. Carroll county was created in 1840 and named for Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.
