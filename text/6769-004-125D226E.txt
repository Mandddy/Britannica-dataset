Boomslang, (Dispholidus typus), venomous snake of the family Colubridae, one of the few colubrid species that is decidedly dangerous to humans. This moderately slender snake grows to about 1.8 metres (6 feet) in length and occurs in savannas throughout sub-Saharan Africa. When hunting, it lies in wait in a bush or tree for chameleons and birds; the forepart of the body often extends motionless into the air.
Its body and eye colour are extremely variable, and camouflage is excellent. In defense the boomslang inflates the neck, showing the dark skin between the scales; it then may strike. It is rear-fanged, but the fangs are set relatively far forward in the mouth. The venom causes hemorrhages and can be fatal to humans in small amounts.
