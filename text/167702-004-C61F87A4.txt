Ray Romano, byname of Raymond Romano  (born December 21, 1957, Queens, New York, U.S.) American comedian and actor perhaps best known as the bumbling well-intentioned father in the television show Everybody Loves Raymond (1996–2005), a witty and insightful portrayal of the quotidian travails of family life.
Romano’s upbringing in the middle-class Forest Hills section of Queens, New York, would later prove a rich mine for the wholesome family-friendly humour that became the comedian’s trademark. In the early 1980s, while studying to be an accountant and holding down a series of part-time jobs, Romano began performing stand-up comedy in New York clubs. In 1987 he decided to pursue stand-up as a career. Winning a citywide comedy contest in 1989 brought him valuable exposure, and in 1990 Romano made his first national television appearance on MTV’s Half-Hour Comedy Hour.
