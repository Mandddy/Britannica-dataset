Tony Garnier,  (born August 13, 1869, Lyon, France—died January 19, 1948, Roquefort-la Bédoule) a forerunner of 20th-century French architects, notable for his Cité Industrielle, a farsighted plan for an industrial city. He is also remembered, along with Auguste Perret, for the pioneering use of reinforced concrete.
On his Prix de Rome grant Garnier developed plans (beginning in 1898, exhibited in 1904, and published in 1917) for an entire industrial city, embracing new concepts in city planning: long, narrow lots running east–west, buildings separated by wide open spaces, separate levels provided for pedestrians, and houses with roof gardens. The plan called for the extensive use of reinforced concrete.
