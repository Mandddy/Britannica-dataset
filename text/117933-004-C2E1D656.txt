Pee Dee River, also called Great Pee Dee River,  river rising as the Yadkin River in the Blue Ridge Mountains in northwestern North Carolina, U.S. Flowing northeast past Wilkesboro and Elkin, then southeast past Badin, it becomes the Pee Dee (named for the Pedee Indians) after a course of about 200 miles (320 km). As the Pee Dee, it continues for another 230 miles (370 km), generally southeastward into South Carolina (where it is called the Great Pee Dee), past Cheraw, being joined by the Little Pee Dee approximately 20 miles (30 km) before emptying into Winyah Bay near Georgetown. As the Yadkin, the river is dammed to form High Rock and Badin lakes (the latter bordered to the east by Uwharrie National Forest) and, as the Pee Dee, to form Lake Tillery and Blewett Falls Lake. The lower Pee Dee is navigable for about 90 miles (145 km).
