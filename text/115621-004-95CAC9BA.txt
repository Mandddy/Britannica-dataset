Ante Pavelić,  (born July 14, 1889, Bradina, Bosnia—died  Dec. 28, 1959, Madrid) Croatian fascist leader and revolutionist who headed a Croatian state subservient to Germany and Italy during World War II.
As a practicing lawyer in Zagreb, Pavelić entered the nationalist Croatian Party of Rights. In 1920 he was elected city and county alderman at Zagreb. From 1927 to 1929 he was a representative in the Yugoslav Skupština (parliament), in which he vigorously opposed centralization of the country. When King Alexander assumed dictatorial power (1929), Pavelić fled to Italy and organized a group of Croatian terrorists known as the Ustaše. They achieved their greatest success in organizing the assassination of King Alexander in Marseille on Oct. 9, 1934.
