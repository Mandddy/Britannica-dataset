Vischer family, sculptors and brass founders working in Nürnberg in the 15th and 16th centuries. Hermann the Elder (d. January 13, 1488) established the foundry. His son Peter the Elder (1460–1529) was the most-celebrated member of the family, producing monumental brass work and bronze work that attracted patrons from as far off as Poland and Hungary.
Works by Peter, who was assisted by his five sons, include the tomb of Archbishop Ernst von Sachsen in Magdeburg Cathedral (1494–95), the colossal bronze figures of Theodoric and King Arthur (1513) for the tomb planned by the emperor Maximilian I, and the Shrine of St. Sebaldus (1516) in the Church of St. Sebaldus in Nürnberg.
