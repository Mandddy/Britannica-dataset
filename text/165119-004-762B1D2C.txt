Saint Anicetus,  (flourished  2nd century, b. Syria?â€”died , Rome; feast day April 17) pope from approximately 155 to approximately 166.
Possibly a Syrian, Anicetus, the tenth successor to St. Peter, laboured to combat the errors of the heresies of Valentine and Marcion and to prevent heresies, working particularly against the Marcionites and Gnostics. Although he suffered tribulations, it is questionable whether or not he was actually martyred. During his pontificate St. Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, visited Rome (c.. 154/155) to confer with him about the controversy over the date of Easter. He allowed Polycarp to celebrate the Eucharist in his church on the Eastern date. Some believe he died a martyr, but this has not been confirmed.
