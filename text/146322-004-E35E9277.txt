Northumberland, administrative and historic county of northeastern England. It is England’s northernmost county, bounded to the north by Scotland, to the east by the North Sea, to the west by the administrative county of Cumbria (historic county of Cumberland), and to the south by the county of Durham. Newcastle was the historic county town (seat) of Northumberland, but Morpeth is the county’s present administrative centre.
Abolished in 2009 were the six administrative entities into which the administrative county had been divided: the districts of Alnwick, Tynedale, and Wansbeck and the boroughs of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Blyth Valley, and Castle Morpeth. The historic county of Northumberland includes the entire administrative county and the metropolitan boroughs of Newcastle upon Tyne and North Tyneside in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.
