National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), the national radio observatory of the United States. It is funded by the National Science Foundation and is managed by Associated Universities, Inc., a consortium of nine leading private universities. Its headquarters are in Charlottesville, Va.
The NRAO was established in the mid-1950s and acquired its first operational radio telescope in 1959. It now has four principal observing facilities: at Green Bank, W.Va.; at Kitt Peak, near Tucson, Ariz.; at a site 80 km (50 miles) west of Socorro, N.M; and at a site 50 km (30 miles) east of San Pedro de Atacama in Chile. The NRAO was originally headquartered at the Green Bank site, whose chief instrument was a 91-metre (300-foot) partially steerable radio telescope that was completed in 1962 but which inexplicably collapsed in 1988. Its replacement, the Green Bank Telescope, which entered operation in 2000, has an aperture of 100 metres (330 feet) and is one of the worldâ€™s largest fully steerable radio telescopes. The NRAO has several other important radio telescopes. The Very Large Array, near Socorro, is one of the most powerful radio telescopes in the world. The Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) is an array of 10 identical 25-metre radio telescopes spread across the United States that are used for very long baseline interferometry. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), an array of 66 12-metre (39-foot) radio telescopes near San Pedro de Atacama on the Chajnantor plateau in Chile at an altitude of 5,000 metres (16,000 feet), is planned for completion in 2012.
