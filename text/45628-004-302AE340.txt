Orhon River,  Orhon also spelled Orkhon, or Orchon,  river in north-central Mongolia. The river lies entirely within Mongolia and rises from the heavily forested slopes of the Hangayn Mountains. It flows east out of the mountains and then turns north, past Karakorum, the ancient capital of the Mongol empire. The Orhon is separated from the Selenge River by a massif. Both rivers flow northeast to meet at Sühbaatar, a trade centre just south of the border with Russia. The Selenge then continues northward into Russia. Funerary stelae dating from the 8th century and containing some of the oldest known writing in a Turkic language were discovered near Karakorum in 1889 and are known as the Orhon inscriptions.
The Orhon River is 700 miles (1,130 km) long and is navigable for shallow-draft vessels only in July and August. The river has a drainage area of some 51,000 square miles (132,000 square km). The primary tributaries are the Tuul, Haraa, and Yöröö rivers, all of which rise in the Hentiyn Mountains and enter the Orhon from the right. The Tuul river flows past Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, on its way to the Orhon. Because of unreliable rainfall and harsh winters, agriculture along the Orhon River is limited to subsistence farming.
