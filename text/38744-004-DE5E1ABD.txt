Mungo Park,  (born Sept. 10, 1771, Fowlshiels, Selkirk, Scot.—died c. January 1806, near Bussa on the Niger River [now in Nigeria]) Scottish explorer of the Niger.
Educated as a surgeon at the University of Edinburgh, Park was appointed a medical officer in 1792 on a vessel engaged in the East Indies trade. His subsequent studies of the plant and animal life of Sumatra won for him the backing of the African Association to explore the true course of the Niger River. Beginning his exploration at the mouth of the Gambia River on June 21, 1795, Park ascended that river for 200 miles to Pisania (now Karantaba, The Gambia), a British trading station. Hampered by fever and formidable hardships, he crossed the unknown territory of the upper Sénégal River basin. He was imprisoned by an Arab chief for four months but escaped on July 1, 1796, to continue his journey with little more than a horse and a compass. On July 20 he reached Ségou (now in Mali) on the Niger, which he followed downstream for 80 miles (130 km) to Silla. Finally forced to turn back for lack of supplies, Park, traveling on foot, took a more southerly route on his return. After traversing mountainous country, he arrived at Kamalia in Mandingo country, where he lay dangerously ill with fever for seven months. With the assistance of a slave trader, he reached Pisania on June 10, 1797. He returned to Britain to write an account of his adventures, Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa (1797), which became a popular success and made him famous.
