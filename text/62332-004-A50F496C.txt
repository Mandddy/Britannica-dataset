Campanile, bell tower, usually built beside or attached to a church; the word is most often used in connection with Italian architecture. The earliest campaniles, variously dated from the 6th to the 10th century, were plain round towers with a few small, round-arched openings grouped near the top. Typical examples of this type stand beside the churches of Sant’Apollinare in Classe (c. 532–49) and Sant’Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (c. 490). Round campaniles appeared occasionally in later periods; the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa (begun in 1173), sheathed in a series of superimposed arcades, is a more elaborate version of this type.
From the 10th century onward, most campaniles were based on a square ground plan, which seems to have been developed simultaneously in Rome and Lombardy. This type was generally decorated with projecting vertical strips, known as lesenes, and with ranges of arcaded cornices that divided the tower into several stages. The roof, particularly in early examples, was usually a pyramid of low pitch, invisible from the ground. This type of campanile prevailed, with minor variations, throughout the Middle Ages, as seen at Santa Prassede (1080) and Santa Maria in Trastevere (c. 1140).
