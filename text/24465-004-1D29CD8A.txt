Sydney Thompson Dobell,  (born April 5, 1824, Cranbrook, Kent, Eng.—died  Aug. 22, 1874, Nailsworth, Gloucestershire) English poet of the so-called Spasmodic school.
The long dramatic poem The Roman (1850), which Dobell published under the name Sydney Yendys, celebrated the cause of Italian liberation. Another long poem, Balder (1853), is concerned with the inner life of a poet who kills his wife after she has gone mad. It was devastatingly burlesqued in Firmilian: . . . a Spasmodic Tragedy (1854) by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, who, with Charles Kingsley, deemed Dobell one of the poets of the Spasmodic school, a term they used to ridicule the formlessness, chaotic imagery, and exaggerated passion of these poets’ work. The aesthetic of the Spasmodic school was expressed by Dobell in a number of essays collected in 1876 as Thoughts on Art, Philosophy, and Religion. Dobell collaborated with Alexander Smith on a sonnet sequence (1855) on the Crimean War and published a collection of shorter poems, England in Time of War (1856), which contains the powerful ballad “Keith of Ravelston.”
