Hendrik Conscience,  (born Dec. 3, 1812, Antwerp, Belg.—died Sept. 10, 1883, Elsene) Belgian romantic novelist who so dominated the birth and development of the Flemish novel that it was said he “taught his people to read.”
Conscience’s father was French, his mother Flemish. He spent some of his early years as an assistant teacher (1828–30), took part in the uprising of July 1830 (which resulted in the independence of Belgium), and served in the Belgian army from 1831 to 1836. After falling under the spell of the Kempen, a quiet region of pinewoods and heather north of Antwerp, he was introduced to French romanticism and began to write French verse. Demobilized in 1836, he entered the literary and artistic life of Antwerp. He was fascinated by his country’s Flemish past and wrote in Dutch (or Flemish, as it is often known). In’t wonderjaar (1837; “In the Year of Miracles”), a series of historical scenes centred on the eventful year 1566, when the Calvinists of the Spanish Netherlands revolted against the Spanish Catholic rule. With De leeuw van Vlaanderen (1838; The Lion of Flanders), the passionate epic of the revolt of the Flemish towns against France and the victory of the Flemish militia at the Battle of the Golden Spurs (1302), he not only created the Flemish novel but wrote an outstanding historical novel in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott.
