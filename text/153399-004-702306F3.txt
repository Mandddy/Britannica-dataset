Eṣfahān, also spelled Isfahan,  capital of Eṣfahān province and major city of western Iran. Eṣfahān is situated on the north bank of the Zāyandeh River at an elevation of about 5,200 feet (1,600 metres), roughly 210 miles (340 km) south of the capital city of Tehrān. Eṣfahān first thrived under the Seljūq Turks (11th–12th century) and then under the Persian Ṣafavid dynasty (16th–18th century). In addition to being an important regional and provincial capital (of Eṣfahān province), the city is one of the most important architectural centres in the Islamic world. In 1979 Eṣfahān’s Maydān-e Emām (Persian: “Imam’s Square”; formerly Maydān-e Shāh, “Royal Square”) was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Pop. (2006) 1,602,110.
A town named Gabae (later called Gay in Middle Persian and Jayy in Arabic) at the site of modern Eṣfahān can be traced back to at least the Achaemenid era (559–330 bce), but little is known about the area before the rule of the Sāsānian dynasty (c. 224–c. 651 ce). In the 5th century Queen Shushan-Dukht, the Jewish consort of Yazdegerd I (reigned 399–420), is said to have settled a colony of Jews nearby in Yahūdiyyeh (literally “town of the Jews”). (The establishment of the colony has also been attributed to Nebuchadrezzar, but that seems less likely.) The Shahrestān Bridge, which spans the Zāyandeh River a short distance southeast of the city, dates from the Sāsānian era; the piers are, however, all that remain of the original structure, the upper part having often been rebuilt. After the Arab conquest in 642, the city came to be known by the regional name Eṣfahān. Under the Arabs it served as the capital of Al-Jibāl (“the Mountains”) province, an area that covered much of ancient Media.
