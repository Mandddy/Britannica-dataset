Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester,  (born c. 1208, Montfort, Ile-de-France, France—died Aug. 4, 1265, Evesham, Worcestershire, Eng.) leader of the baronial revolt against King Henry III and ruler of England for less than a year.
Simon de Montfort, wholly French by birth and education, was the son of Simon de Montfort l’Amaury, leader of the Crusade against the heretical Albigenses. On coming of age, he renounced to his eldest brother, Amaury, his claims on the family lands in return for the sole right to revive the Montfort claim to the English earldom of Leicester. This claim derived from his father’s mother, Amicia, sister of Robert IV (died 1204), the last Beaumont earl of Leicester, whose lands had been divided between Amicia and her younger sister Margaret, countess of Winchester. King John had recognized Simon’s father as earl (c. 1205) but had deprived him as a French subject (1207), and the Montfort claim had then lapsed.
