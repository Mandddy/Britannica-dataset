Martin Puryear,  (born May 23, 1941, Washington, D.C., U.S.) American sculptor whose streamlined and evocative sculptures made from materials such as wood and wire are associated with Postminimalism.
Puryear grew up in Washington, D.C., and there attended Catholic University of America (B.A., 1963). After graduating, he joined the Peace Corps for two years, teaching in a remote village in Sierra Leone. Puryear, who is African American, was intrigued by the native crafts he saw there, and he subsequently studied woodworking and design in Stockholm before returning to the United States to attend Yale University (M.F.A., 1971). He taught at Fisk University in Nashville and at the University of Maryland before moving to Chicago in 1978. He taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1978 to 1990 and then moved to upstate New York, where he continued to work. He received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1989.
