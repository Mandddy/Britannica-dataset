Isaac de Benserade,  (born 1612 or 1613, Normandy or Paris, France—died  Oct. 20, 1691, Paris) minor French poet of the courts of Louis XIII and Louis XIV.
Benserade began visiting the salon of the Marquise de Rambouillet, the literary centre of Paris, in 1634 and wrote a succession of romantic verses that won him a reputation culminating in the “sonnets controversy” of 1649, in which his sonnet “Job” was pitted against Vincent Voiture’s “Uranie” in a lively court debate over poetic style. Although Benserade was adjudged the loser, he became a favourite and was repeatedly called upon to write libretti for royal ballets, a function that he discharged with a wit frequently regarded by his court audience as daring and even impertinent. Elected to the French Academy in 1674, Benserade was criticized in 1676 for his Metamorphoses d’Ovide en rondeaux. He distinguished himself, however, by his support of the candidacy of Jean de La Fontaine for the academy and by his defense of the rationalism of Pierre Bayle, which the censorship threatened.
