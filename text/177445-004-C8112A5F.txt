Affenpinscher, also called monkey terrier ,  breed of toy dog known since the 17th century. It is thought to have originated in Germany, where it was bred to be a ratter—to kill rats, mice, and other small vermin. Like other terriers, it is lively and playful. The affenpinscher stands 9.5 to 11.5 inches (24 to 29 cm) tall and weighs 7 to 8 pounds (3 to 3.5 kg). A sturdily built dog, it has small erect ears that are usually cropped, round black eyes, and a short, docked tail. While a black coat is preferred, it may also be gray, silver, red, black and tan, or beige. The wiry coat is short on parts of the body but longer on the legs and on the face, where it produces the monkeylike expression for which the breed is named (affen being the German word for “monkeys”).
