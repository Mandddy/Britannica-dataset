Masjed-e Emām, (
        Persian: “Imam Mosque”) formerly Masjed-e Shāh (“Royal Mosque”),  celebrated 17th-century mosque in Eṣfahān, Iran. The mosque, part of the rebuilding effort of the Ṣafavid shah ʿAbbās I, was located at the centre of Eṣfahān, along a great central mall (city square, or courtyard) called the Maydān-e Emām (since 1979 a World Heritage site). Along with the three neighbouring structures of the period, the Masjed-e Emām is notable for its logically precise vaulting and inventive use of coloured tiles. The mosque was renamed after the Iranian Revolution of 1979.
