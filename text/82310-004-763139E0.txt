Rupee, monetary unit of Muslim India from the 16th century and the modern monetary unit of India and Pakistan. The modern unit is divided into 100 paisa in India and Pakistan. The name derives from the Sanskrit rupya (“silver”). The rupee is also the name of the monetary unit used in Mauritius, Nepal, and Seychelles.
In the late 16th century the rulers of the Mughal dynasty of central and northern India established the silver rupee, which was divided into 16 annas. In 1671 the British East India Company minted coins copied from local types, using the rupee as the basic unit of account. The value of the rupee varied from region to region, however, depending on the minter, and not until 1835 was the rupee made uniform by law.
