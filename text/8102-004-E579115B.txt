Springer spaniel, either of two ancient breeds of sporting dogs used to flush game from cover and to retrieve it. The English springer spaniel is a medium-sized, compact dog standing 19 to 20 inches (48 to 51 cm) and weighing 40 to 50 pounds (18 to 23 kg). Its glossy coat is flat or wavy and usually black and white or liver-coloured and white. The English springer spaniel is valued both as a companion and for its use in the field as a pheasant hunter. The Welsh springer spaniel, known since at least the 14th century, is somewhat smaller than the English; its flat coat is always red-brown and white, with feathering on the chest, legs, and belly. It stands 17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm). It is noted as both a pet and a tireless, capable hunting dog and retriever.
