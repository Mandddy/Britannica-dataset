James Edward Oglethorpe,  (born December 22, 1696, London, Englandâ€”died June 30/July 1, 1785, Cranham Hall, Essex, England) English army officer, philanthropist, and founder of the British colony of Georgia in America.
Educated at the University of Oxford, he entered the army in 1712 and joined the Austrian army fighting the Turks in 1717. On his return to England in 1722, he entered Parliament. In 1729 he presided over a committee that brought about prison reforms. This experience gave him the idea of founding a new colony in North America as a place where the poor and destitute could start afresh and where persecuted Protestant sects could find refuge.
