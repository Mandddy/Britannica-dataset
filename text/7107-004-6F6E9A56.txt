Edward Carpenter,  (born Aug. 29, 1844, Brighton, Sussex, Eng.—died  June 28, 1929, Guildford, Surrey) English writer identified with social and sexual reform and the late 19th-century anti-industrial Arts and Crafts Movement.
Carpenter was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he was elected a fellow and ordained in 1869. In 1870 he became the theologian Frederick Denison Maurice’s curate. But in 1874, revolting against the social and religious conventions of his time, he became a traveling lecturer for the newly founded university extension movement, teaching in industrial towns in the north of England. In 1883 he bought a small farm in Derbyshire, where he lived until 1922.
