Miloš Forman,  (born February 18, 1932, Čáslav, Czechoslovakia [now in the Czech Republic]) Czech-born New Wave filmmaker known primarily for the distinctively American movies that he made after his immigration to the United States.
Forman grew up in a small town near Prague. After his parents, Jewish professor Rudolf Forman and a Protestant housewife, died in Nazi concentration camps, he was reared by two uncles and family friends; in the 1960s he learned that his biological father was not Rudolf Forman but a Jewish architect. In the mid-1950s Forman studied at the Film Faculty of the Academy of Arts in Prague. Upon graduating he wrote two screenplays, the first of which, Nechte to na mně (1955; Leave It to Me), was filmed by noted Czech director Martin Frič. Forman was an assistant director on the second of those screenplays, a situation comedy entitled Štěňata (1958; Cubs).
