Artur Rubinstein, Artur also spelled Arthur  (born January 28, 1887, Łódź, Poland, Russian Empire—died December 20, 1982, Geneva, Switzerland) Polish American virtuoso pianist regarded by many as the 20th century’s foremost interpreter of the repertoire.
Rubinstein began study at the age of three and at the age of eight studied at the Warsaw Conservatory. The following year he became a pupil of Heinrich Barth in Berlin. Rubinstein was seven when he made his first public appearance, and he made his European debut in Berlin at 13. In 1906 he made his American debut with the Philadelphia Orchestra at Carnegie Hall but received a cool reception because of his youth. During World War I Rubinstein, who was fluent in eight languages, served as a military interpreter in London and performed there with the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. From 1916 to 1918 he visited Spain and South America and created a sensation by introducing works by Manuel de Falla, Isaac Albéniz, and Enrique Granados. Another trip to the United States in 1919 proved to be lacklustre, however.
