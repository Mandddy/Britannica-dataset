Georges Chastellain,  Chastellain also spelled Chastelain   (born c. 1405 or c. 1415, Aalst, Brabant—died  1475, Valenciennes, Burgundian Hainaut) Burgundian chronicler and one of the leading court poets. He had many literary admirers and followers, among them Jean Molinet and Pierre Michault.
Chastellain served Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, until in 1435, after the Peace of Arras, he abandoned soldiering. He spent the next years in France, mainly as secretary to Pierre de Brézé, seneschal of Poitou, and trying to improve relations between Philip the Good and Charles VII of France. His affection for France remained constant even when, in 1446, he entered Philip’s household. There, too, he was used on secret and diplomatic missions, and in 1455 he was also appointed Burgundian historiographer. About 1463 Molinet, his disciple and successor, became his secretary.
