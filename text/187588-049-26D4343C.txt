Charles Falconer, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, in full Charles Leslie Falconer  (born November 19, 1951, Edinburgh, Scotland) British politician whose term as lord chancellor (2003–07) was marked by reform of the legal system of the United Kingdom.
Falconer was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond (now Glenalmond College), in Scotland and studied law at the University of Cambridge, Queen’s College. As a boy, he made the acquaintance of Tony Blair (future prime minister of the United Kingdom), and in the 1960s the two even competed to date the same young woman. By 1976 they were both young barristers working in the same building. Blair moved into Falconer’s apartment in south London for a time, and both became active in the same local branch of the Labour Party.
