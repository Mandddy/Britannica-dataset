Dormancy, state of reduced metabolic activity adopted by many organisms under conditions of environmental stress or, often, as in winter, when such stressful conditions are likely to appear.
There are few environments in which organisms are not subject to some kind of stress. Some animals migrate vast distances to avoid unfavourable situations; others reduce environmental stresses by modifying their behaviour and the habitats (immediate surroundings) that they occupy. Arctic lemmings, for example, are able to avoid severe winter weather by confining their life in winter to activities beneath the snow cover. Still another mechanism used by some organisms to avoid stressful environmental conditions is that of dormancy, during which an organism conserves the amount of energy available to it and makes few demands on its environment. Most major groups of animals as well as plants have some representatives that can become dormant. Periods of dormancy vary in length and in degree of metabolic reduction, ranging from only slightly lower metabolism during the periodic, short-duration dormancy of deep sleep to more extreme reductions for extended periods of time.
