Feline leukemia, also called feline lymphosarcoma,  viral disease of cats, one of the most serious diseases affecting domestic cats and a few other Felidae. The disease occurs worldwide. Signs include enlargement of the lymph nodes, depression, emaciation, and, frequently, diarrhea; there is no known treatment, and the outcome is usually fatal. A fluorescent antibody test developed in the 1970s produced evidence that the virus is present in many apparently healthy cats. Preventive vaccines are available. The disease can spread among animals; however, there is no proved connection with leukemia in humans.
