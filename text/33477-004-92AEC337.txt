Chikamatsu Monzaemon, original name Sugimori Nobumori   (born 1653, Echizen [now in Fukui prefecture], Japan—died Jan. 6, 1725, Amagasaki, Settsu province?) Japanese playwright, widely regarded as among the greatest dramatists of that country. He is credited with more than 100 plays, most of which were written as jōruri dramas, performed by puppets. He was the first author of jōruri to write works that not only gave the puppet operator the opportunity to display his skill but also were of considerable literary merit.
Chikamatsu was born into a samurai family, but his father apparently abandoned his feudal duties sometime between 1664 and 1670, moving the family to Kyōto. While there, Chikamatsu served a member of the court aristocracy. The origin of his connection to the theatre is unknown. Yotsugi Soga (1683; “The Soga Heir”), a jōruri, is the first play that can be definitely attributed to Chikamatsu. The following year he wrote a Kabuki play, and by 1693 he was writing exclusively for actors. In 1703 he reestablished an earlier connection with the jōruri chanter Takemoto Gidayū, and he moved in 1705 from Kyōto to Ōsaka to be nearer to Gidayū’s puppet theatre, the Takemoto-za. Chikamatsu remained a staff playwright for this theatre until his death.
