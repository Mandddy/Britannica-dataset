Taieri River,  river in southeastern South Island, New Zealand. It rises in the Lammerlaw Range and flows 179 miles (288 km) north and southeast in a great arc—across the Maniototo Plains, around the Rock and Pillar Range, and across the Taieri Plains—to the Pacific Ocean, 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Dunedin. Tributaries in the river’s 720-square-mile (1,860-square-kilometre) basin include Serpentine Creek; Sowburn, Wether Burn, Kyeburn, and Nenthorn streams; and Waipori River. Gorges are found in both the upper and lower reaches of the Taieri, which has laid down the fertile Taieri Plains near its mouth. Launches may navigate the river as far as Henley. The river’s name is possibly derived from the Maori word for “to smash,” or “to pound up,” and “shining river”; it may also refer to an unusual flow of the river’s tides.
