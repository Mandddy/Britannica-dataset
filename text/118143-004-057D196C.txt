Mel Blanc, byname of Melvin Jerome Blanc   (born May 30, 1908, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died July 10, 1989, Los Angeles, California) entertainer renowned as America’s greatest voice-over artist who created more than 400 unique voices for popular radio, television, movie, and cartoon characters.
Blanc was interested in music at an early age and became proficient on bass, violin, and sousaphone. He began his professional life as a radio musician in the late 1920s, and in 1933 he and his wife cohosted a daily radio program from Portland, Oregon. As the low-budgeted show did not allow for the hiring of supporting actors on a daily basis, Blanc was compelled to provide a variety of voices himself and thus began honing the skills that brought him success. He did freelance work for Los Angeles-area radio stations throughout the 1930s and in 1937 joined Leon Schlesinger’s animation unit at Warner Bros. studios. Nicknamed “Termite Terrace” because of its spartan accommodations on the Warner lot, Schlesinger’s unit produced the enormously popular and enduringly influential Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoon shorts. Blanc’s first assignment for the company was to give voice to a drunken bull in the 1937 short Picador Porky.
