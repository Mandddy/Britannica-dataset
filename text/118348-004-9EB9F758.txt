Sheila Scott, original name Sheila Christine Hopkins   (born April 27, 1927, Worcester, Worcestershire [now in Hereford and Worcester], Eng.—died  Oct. 20, 1988, London) British aviator who broke more than 100 light-aircraft records between 1965 and 1972 and was the first British pilot to fly solo around the world.
After attending a Worcester boarding school, Scott became a trainee nurse at Haslar Naval Hospital (1944), where she tended the wounded during World War II. In London she appeared in small roles for theatre, film, and television and worked as a model (1945–59). In 1960 she earned her pilot’s license, bought an old biplane from the Royal Air Force, and won several races, capturing the De Havilland and the Jean Lennox Bird trophies for that year. To pay for her flying, she became a demonstrator for Cessna and Piper aircraft.
