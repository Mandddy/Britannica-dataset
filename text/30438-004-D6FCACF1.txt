Jacob Bjerknes,  (born November 2, 1897, Stockholm, Swed.â€”died July 7, 1975, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) Norwegian American meteorologist whose discovery that cyclones (low-pressure centres) originate as waves associated with sloping weather fronts that separate different air masses proved to be a major contribution to modern weather forecasting.
The work of his father, the Norwegian physicist and meteorologist Vilhelm F.K. Bjerknes, influenced Bjerknes in his choice of meteorology as a career. During World War I he assisted his father in establishing a network of weather observation stations throughout Norway. Data gathered by these stations gave rise to their theory of polar fronts, essential to understanding the dynamics of weather in the middle and high latitudes. During the 1920s and 1930s, in addition to his studies of cyclones, he gathered data on the structure of low-pressure centres and conducted research on the dynamics of atmospheric convection.
