Bucranium,  decorative motif representing an ox killed in religious sacrifice. The motif originated in a ceremony wherein an ox’s head was hung from the wooden beams supporting the temple roof; this scene was later represented, in stone, on the frieze, or stone lintels, above the columns in Doric temples.
The motif has been found on painted pottery in Iraq dating from 5000 bc. It was later imported into Bronze Age Crete as part of the bull and double-ax cult, where the bull’s head was decorated with a garland of bay leaves. In Roman examples, the garland of bay leaves was omitted. The motif was also used in Renaissance architecture, for example, at the 17th-century Knole Palace in Kent, England.
