Ferdinand Vandiveer Hayden,  (born September 7, 1829, Westfield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died December 22, 1887, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) American geologist who was a pioneer investigator of the western United States. His explorations and geologic studies of the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains helped lay the foundation of the U.S. Geological Survey.
In 1853 Hayden made a trip with the paleontologist Fielding B. Meek to the Dakota Badlands to collect fossils. Their discoveries reinforced Hayden’s interest in the West, and thus began a series of scientific explorations carried on for 30 years, during which Hayden’s industry and contagious enthusiasm became legendary. The “Hayden surveys” launched numerous American scientists on brilliant careers, and their maps and about 50 published volumes provided valuable scientific data on the geology, botany, and zoology of the West. Hayden collected fossils, tried to determine stratigraphic sequences in rock formations, and studied uplift, folding, faulting, and other geologic processes evident in the Rockies.
