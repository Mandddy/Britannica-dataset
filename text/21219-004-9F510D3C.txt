Ganymede, also called Jupiter III ,  largest of Jupiter’s satellites and of all the satellites in the solar system. One of the Galilean moons, it was discovered by the Italian astronomer Galileo in 1610. It was probably also discovered independently that same year by the German astronomer Simon Marius, who named it after Ganymede of Greek mythology.
Ganymede has a diameter of about 5,270 km (3,275 miles), which makes it larger than the planet Mercury. It orbits Jupiter at a distance of 1,070,000 km (665,000 miles). Ganymede’s relatively low density of 1.93 grams per cubic cm indicates that its composition is roughly half rock and half water ice by mass. Spacecraft investigations of its gravity field reveal that the interior consists of a dense, iron-rich core with a radius of 1,500 km (930 miles) surrounded by a rocky lower mantle, which is wrapped with a layer of ice some 700 km (430 miles) thick. The iron core produces a magnetic field that is 1 percent as strong as Earth’s. Above the ice layer is likely a subsurface ocean possibly 100 km (60 miles) deep. The top layer of the satellite is an icy crust about 150 km (90 miles) thick.
