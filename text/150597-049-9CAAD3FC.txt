P’ansori, sometimes called Korean folk opera,  a genre of narrative song of Korea, typically performed dramatically by a vocalist, accompanied by a puk (double-headed barrel drum). Built from the word p’an, meaning “open space,” and sori, meaning “singing” or “sound,” the term p’ansori itself is a reference to the markets, public squares, and other such open venues where performances originally took place.
With a fan in hand, a p’ansori singer uses a combination of ch’ang (song), sasŏl (narration), and pallim (dramatic gesture) to tell a story. Meanwhile, the drummer provides the appropriate rhythmic setting for each song. A considerable amount of improvised interaction occurs between the drummer and the vocalist throughout the performance.
