Sir George Jessel,  (born Feb. 13, 1824, London, Eng.—died  March 21, 1883, London) jurist considered one of the greatest English trial judges in equity. It is said that Jessel, as solicitor general (1871–73), was the first professing Jew to hold important governmental office in England. (Benjamin Disraeli, who had become prime minister in 1868, was born into Judaism but was baptized a Christian at the age of 12.)
The son of a London merchant, Jessel attended University College, London, and studied law at Lincoln’s Inn. Called to the bar in 1847, Jessel was appointed a queen’s counsel in 1865 and was elected to the House of Commons as a Liberal in 1868. From 1873 he was master of the rolls, originally sitting both as a judge of first instance in the Rolls Court and as a member of the Court of Appeal. Later, however, after statutes of 1875 and 1876 had made the master of the rolls the president of the Court of Appeal, he was exclusively an appellate judge.
