Ike Turner, original name Izear Luster Turner, Jr.  (born Nov. 5, 1931, Clarksdale, Miss., U.S.—died  Dec. 12, 2007, San Marcos, Calif.) American rhythm-and-blues and soul performer and producer who was best known for his work with Tina Turner.
 Ike Turner began playing piano as a child and by the late 1940s had played with a number of the leading blues musicians in the Mississippi Delta region. While in high school he formed a band, the Kings of Rhythm. Their first recording, “Rocket 88”—made at Sam Phillips’s Memphis (Tennessee) Recording Service but released on the Chess label—was a number one rhythm-and-blues hit in 1951, though it was credited to saxophonist Jackie Brenston (who provided the lead vocal) and the Delta Cats. After Brenston’s departure, Ike served as a talent scout in the Memphis region for Los Angeles-based Modern Records and played as a session musician on early recordings by Howlin’ Wolf, B.B. King, and others.
