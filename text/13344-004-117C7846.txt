John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton,  (born Oct. 18, 1731, Ashburton, Devonshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 18, 1783, Exmouth, Devonshire) English jurist and politician who defended the radical John Wilkes against charges of seditious and obscene libel (1763–64) and who is also important as the author of a resolution in Parliament (April 6, 1780) condemning George III for his support of Lord North’s government despite the unpopularity of its policies during the American Revolution (1775–83).
Dunning was appointed solicitor general in 1768, probably at the instance of Lord Chancellor Camden, who as chief justice of common pleas had upheld Dunning’s argument against general warrants (in Wilkes’s case). In the same year, Dunning’s election to Parliament was secured by Lord Shelburne.
