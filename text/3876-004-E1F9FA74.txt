Salat, also spelled salah, Arabic ṣalāt ,  the daily ritual prayer enjoined upon all Muslims as one of the five Pillars of Islam (arkān al-Islām). There is disagreement among Islamic scholars as to whether some passages about prayer in the Muslim sacred scripture, the Qurʾān, are actually references to the salat. Within Muhammad’s lifetime five ritual prayers, each preceded by ablution, were observed: ṣalāt al-fajr (dawn), aẓ-ẓuhr (midday), al-ʿaṣr (afternoon), al-maghrib (sunset), and al-ʿishāʾ (evening). Under such special circumstances as illness, a journey, or war, a modification or limited postponement of these salats is allowed.
Though individual performance of salat is permissible, collective worship in the mosque has special merit. With their faces turned in the direction of the shrine of the Kaʿbah in Mecca, the worshipers align themselves in parallel rows behind the imam, or prayer leader, who directs them as they execute the rakʿahs (physical postures coupled with Qurʾānic recitations).
