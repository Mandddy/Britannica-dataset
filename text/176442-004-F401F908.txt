The Vikings, American adventure film, released in 1958, that was based on the novel The Viking by Edison Marshall. It was noted for its efforts to be an authentic portrayal of Viking life.
The story was filmed primarily on location in Norway and Brittany, France, and tracks the lives of two Viking half brothers, Einar (played by Kirk Douglas) and Eric (Tony Curtis), who do not know that they are related. Their father is the Viking leader Ragnar (Ernest Borgnine). Throughout the film, warrior Einar feuds with Eric, whom he believes to be no more than a former slave. Both brothers vie for the attentions of the beautiful Welsh princess Morgana (Janet Leigh), who has been promised to the Northumbrian king Aella. Eric and Einar temporarily set aside their mutual hatred for a joint attack on the wicked Aella. However, their inevitable sword battle for the princess brings the movie to a close, with Einar, who has learned of Ericâ€™s kinship, hesitating when he has the chance to kill his half brother. This gives Eric the opportunity to kill Einar instead, which he does in ignorance of their relationship.
