A Streetcar Named Desire, American film drama, released in 1951, that made Marlon Brando a movie star and helped revolutionize acting in the mid-20th century.
Adapted by Tennessee Williams from his Broadway play, the sexually charged saga centres on the marriage of Stella Kowalski (played by Kim Hunter) and Stanley (played by Brando), her brutish husband. The plot thickens with the arrival of Stella’s sister, Blanche DuBois (played by Vivien Leigh)—an aging, alcoholic, but still alluring Southern belle who scandalously lost her teaching post because of her affair with a student and whose pretensions of virtue and delusions of grandeur lead to dramatic consequences.
