Edmund Kean,  (born March 17?, 1789, London, England—died May 15, 1833, London) one of the greatest of English tragic actors, a turbulent genius noted as much for his megalomania and ungovernable behaviour as for his portrayals of villains in Shakespearean plays.
Though no official record of his birth exists, it has been well established that he was born out of wedlock to Ann Carey, who described herself as an itinerant actress and street hawker, and Edmund Kean, a mentally unbalanced youth who committed suicide at the age of 22. The story of Kean’s upbringing is overladen with legend, much of it the product of his own later fantasies, but during his formative years he was in the charge of Charlotte Tidswell, mistress of Moses Kean, his father’s eldest brother. Tidswell, then a small-part member of the Drury Lane Theatre Company, was the cast-off mistress of Charles Howard, the 11th duke of Norfolk. Extremely ambitious for her adopted child, she gave Edmund both an early stage training and the rudiments of a general education. Her efforts to provide a disciplined home background were defeated, however, by his willfulness and vagrancy, and for much of his childhood he lived as a waif and stray.
