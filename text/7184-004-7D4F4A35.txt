Hutu, also called Bahutu or Wahutu,  Bantu-speaking people of Rwanda and Burundi. Numbering about 9,500,000 in the late 20th century, the Hutu comprise the vast majority in both countries but were traditionally subject to the Tutsi, warrior-pastoralists of Nilotic stock.
When the Hutu first entered the area, they found it inhabited by the Twa, Pygmy hunters whom they forced to retreat. Hutu life centred on small-scale agriculture, and social organization was based on the clan, with petty kings (bahinza) ruling over limited domains. The Tutsi in turn entered the area in the 14th or 15th century and gradually subjugated the Hutu, forcing them into a lord–vassal relationship. The Tutsi remained dominant in Rwanda until the period 1959–61, when the Hutu expelled most of the Tutsi from the country and took over control of the government. An unsuccessful Hutu coup attempt took place in Burundi in 1965, and that country’s Hutu remained subordinate under a Tutsi-dominated military government. Relations between the two groups periodically led to mass killings and struggles. In 1994, one of the worst incidents of genocide in modern history took place in Rwanda, where Hutu extremists slaughtered nearly a million Tutsi and moderate Hutu.
