Front, in meteorology, interface or transition zone between two air masses of different density and temperature; the sporadic flareups of weather along this zone, with occasional thunderstorms and electrical activity, was, to the Norwegian meteorologists who gave it its name during World War I, analogous to the fighting along the battle line in Europe. Frontal zones are frequently accompanied by low barometric pressure (a pressure trough), marked changes in wind direction and relative humidity, and considerable cloudiness and precipitation.
There are several different types of fronts, depending basically on the direction of movement of the colder air mass. Meteorologists call the leading edge of an advancing mass of relatively cold air a cold front. In middle and high latitudes of both hemispheres, cold fronts tend to move toward the Equator and eastward, with the most advanced position right at the ground. At a height of about 1.5 km (1 mile), the front usually lies 80 to 160 km (50 to 100 miles) behind its surface position; thus, its slope is 1/50 to 1/100. A cold front is usually associated with showers and thunderstorms. As it advances, often quite rapidly (50 to 65 km [30 to 40 miles] per hour), the cold air, which is relatively dense, undercuts the displaced warm air, forcing it to rise. In extreme cases, the resulting instability may lead to the formation of a squall line of severe thunderstorms and possibly tornadoes parallel to and about 80 km ahead of the surface position of the cold front. The precipitation usually stops abruptly after the front passes.
