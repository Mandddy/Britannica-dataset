Janet Jagan, née Janet Rosenberg  (born October 20, 1920, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died March 28, 2009, Georgetown, Guyana) American-born Guyanese politician who was the first white president of Guyana (1997–99) and the first elected female president in South America.
She was born into a middle-class Jewish family. In 1942, while working as a student nurse in Chicago, she met Cheddi Jagan, a dentistry student from the colony of British Guiana. The following year they were married and moved to Georgetown, British Guiana, where he set up a dental practice. By 1950 they had both become active in politics, and during that year they joined with Linden Forbes Burnham to found the People’s Progressive Party (PPP), with a goal of gaining independence for the colony (which it achieved in 1966). In 1953 the colony was granted home rule, and Cheddi became its first prime minister. He subsequently headed governments from 1957 to 1964, and during that time Janet held several cabinet posts and served in the parliament.
