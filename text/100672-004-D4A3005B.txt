William Wrigley, Jr.,  (born Sept. 30, 1861, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Jan. 26, 1932, Phoenix, Ariz.) American salesman and manufacturer whose company became the largest producer and distributor of chewing gum in the world.
Wrigley went to work as a traveling soap salesman for his father’s company at age 13. In 1891 he went to Chicago as a soap distributor and there started offering baking powder as a premium with each box of soap. In 1892 he began selling baking powder as a sideline, offering chewing gum as a premium. The chewing gum proved more popular than the baking powder, so he dropped both soap and baking powder to sell only chewing gum. He also gave dealers premiums, such as clocks, coffee grinders, or fishing tackle, which varied with the size of the order.
