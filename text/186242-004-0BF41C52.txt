Medardo Rosso,  (born June 20, 1858, Turin, Italy—died March 31, 1928, Milan) 19th-century Italian sculptor generally credited, along with Auguste Rodin, with introducing the technique of Impressionism into sculpture. Rosso’s work has been much studied since World War II by sculptors interested in its free, delicate modeling and subtle, evocative forms.
From his youth, Rosso rejected the strictures of academic art; in 1884 he was expelled from the Brera Academy for his rebellious influence on fellow students. Like the Impressionist painters of his time, he sought to capture in his work the subtle features of everyday modern life and the immediate, elusive sensations of light and movement. As in the work of the painters and also that of his fellow sculptor Rodin, explicit detail is usually subordinated to texture, suggestion, and effect; the features of his portraits emerge in shimmer and shadow (e.g., Lady with a Veil; 1893).
