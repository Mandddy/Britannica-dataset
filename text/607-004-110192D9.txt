Flying snake,  any of five species of nonvenomous snakes constituting the genus Chrysopelea of the family Colubridae. These slender arboreal snakes are found in South Asia and the Indonesian archipelago. They are able to glide short distances through the air by drawing up their ventral scales to make their undersides concave. Flying snakes make an undulatory motion to maintain their balance as they descend.
They are active by day, capturing rodents, bats, birds, and lizards. Chrysopelea ornata of India and Sri Lanka, sometimes called golden treesnake, is up to 100 cm (40 inches) long and usually black or greenish, with yellow or reddish markings.
