European Space Agency (ESA), French Agence Spatiale Européenne (ASE),  European space and space-technology research organization founded in 1975 from the merger of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), both established in 1964. Members include Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Estonia, Hungary, and Slovenia have signed cooperative agreements with ESA in preparation for eventual full membership. In 1981 Canada signed a special cooperative agreement, which enables it to participate in some ESA projects. Headquarters of the agency are in Paris.
Representatives of ESA’s member nations form the agency’s policy-making council. A science program committee established by convention deals with matters related to the mandatory science program; other such bodies may be formed by the council to assist in decision making. The chief executive and legal representative of ESA is the director general, assisted by an inspector general and the directors of various departments.
