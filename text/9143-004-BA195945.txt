Syracuse, Italian Siracusa,  city, on the east coast of Sicily, 33 miles (53 km) south of Catania. It was the chief Greek city of ancient Sicily.
Syracuse was settled about 734 bc by Corinthians led by the aristocrat Archias, and the city soon dominated the coastal plain and hill country beyond. The original Greek settlers of the city formed an elite (gamoroi), while the Sicel natives (Siculi) worked the land as an oppressed class. In the early 5th century bc, the Syracusans were defeated by Hippocrates of Gela, a city lying to the west. The power of the gamoroi in Syracuse was subsequently ended by a democratic revolution, and in exile the gamoroi supported Hippocrates’ successor, Gelon, who captured Syracuse and transferred his government there. Gelon ruled Syracuse from 485 to 478. His defeat of a great Carthaginian invasion in 480 at Himera confirmed his supremacy, and, under him and his brother Hieron, Syracuse attained a high point of power and cultural brilliance. A revolution in 466 overthrew Hieron’s successor as tyrant, Thrasybulus, and under a democratic constitution the Syracusans survived wars against the neighbouring city of Acragas and the Siculi, although they had to abandon the territorial empire that Gelon had acquired. Most importantly, the Syracusans survived a long siege by the Athenians (415–413) that took place during the Peloponnesian War, ultimately destroying the Athenian invasion force in Sicily and weakening Athenian power in Greece itself.
