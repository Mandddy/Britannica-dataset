Samora Machel,  (born September 29, 1933, Chilembene, Mozambique—died October 19, 1986, Mbuzini, South Africa) Mozambican politician, who was the first president of independent Mozambique (1975–86).
Born more than 200 miles north of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, Machel received his education through mission schools. He refused to enter a seminary for higher education and instead became a nurse in Maputo. The experience radicalized him, and, after 10 years in the profession, he joined the clandestine Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo), which sent him to Algeria for military training. He rose quickly through the leadership ranks and became Frelimo’s leader in 1970, after the 1969 assassination of Eduardo Mondlane.
