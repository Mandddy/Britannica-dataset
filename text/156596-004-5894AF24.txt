American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF),  largest farmersâ€™ organization in the United States. The AFBF, founded in 1919, is an independent nongovernmental federation of farm bureaus from all 50 states and Puerto Rico.
The AFBF was an outgrowth of the county farm bureau movement, which started shortly before World War I. Various farming communities began to adopt the use of county demonstration agents, agricultural experts, or extension workers to provide farmers with the results of scientific study, and in many localities these agents were supported by local groups of farmers who constituted county committees or bureaus. Before the end of the war, the county farm bureaus in several states had formed state organizations, and in November 1919 representatives of the state farm bureaus met in Chicago and organized the AFBF.
