Luís de Camões, in full Luís Vaz de Camões, English Luis Vaz de Camoëns or Camoens  (born c. 1524/25, Lisbon, Port.—died June 10, 1580, Lisbon) Portugal’s great national poet, author of the epic poem Os Lusíadas (1572; The Lusiads), which describes Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India. Camões had a permanent and unparalleled impact on Portuguese and Brazilian literature alike, due not only to his epic but also to his posthumously published lyric poetry.
What little information there is about Camões in a strict biographical sense falls into three categories: statements by his first biographers in the 17th century, a few documents unearthed in the 19th century and scant subsequent research, and very abstract allusions (some chronologically uncertain) to his own life in his works. Successive biographers have woven the few concrete facts known about Camões’ life into a bewildering complexity of fantasy and theory that is unsupported by concrete documentary evidence.
