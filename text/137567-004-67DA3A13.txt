Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, in full Carlos Manuel Perfecto del Carmen Céspedes y del Castillo  (born April 18, 1819, Bayamo, Cuba—died February 27, 1874, San Lorenzo) Cuban revolutionary hero. Although his revolution failed, Céspedes started the Ten Years’ War (1868–78), which ultimately led to Cuban independence.
Céspedes was born into a prominent plantation family who had been granted their Cuban estate in 1517. After receiving his baccalaureate from Havana (1840), Céspedes completed his law studies in Spain. While in Spain he took part (1843) in the revolution led by Juan Prim, for which he was exiled to France. Upon his return to Cuba, Céspedes started a law practice, wrote poems and pamphlets, and secretly organized an independence movement.
