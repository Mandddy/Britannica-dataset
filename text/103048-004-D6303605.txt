Penny Marshall, original name Carole Penny Marscharelli   (born Oct. 15, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.)  American actress, comedian, and director, one of the first woman motion picture directors to achieve consistent commercial success.
Marshall was the daughter of a dance teacher and an industrial filmmaker. She first performed with her mother’s dance group, the Marshallettes. Marshall attended the University of New Mexico but left after two years to marry. The couple had a daughter but divorced soon thereafter. In 1967 Marshall moved to Hollywood, where her brother, Garry, was working as a comedy writer and producer. He persuaded her to take acting classes and to try a career in film. Garry gave Marshall her first bit part, a role in the movie How Sweet It Is! (1968). Marshall’s big television break came in 1971 when her brother gave her a small part on The Odd Couple. It was then she met and married the actor-director Rob Reiner (divorced 1979). The following two years she performed on The Bob Newhart Show. In 1975 a guest appearance with Cindy Williams on the television series Happy Days led to the spin-off Laverne and Shirley in 1976. The comedy, which centred on two blue-collar women (Marshall played Laverne) working in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, brewery during the 1950s, ran until 1983.
