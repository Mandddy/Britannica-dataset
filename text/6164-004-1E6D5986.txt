Backgammon,  game played by moving counters on a board or table, the object of the game being a race to a goal, with the movement of the counters being controlled by the throw of two dice. Elements of chance and skill are nicely balanced in backgammon so that each is usually essential to victory. The game became highly popular worldwide in the late 20th century.
Precursors of backgammon are among the most ancient of all games and may date from as early as 3000 bc. The ancient Romans played a game, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (“Twelve-lined Game”), which was identical, or nearly so, to modern backgammon. The game is still most generally played in the eastern Mediterranean countries.
