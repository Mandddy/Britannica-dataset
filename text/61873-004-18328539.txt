Nolan Ryan, in full Lynn Nolan Ryan, Jr.  (born January 31, 1947, Refugio, Texas, U.S.) American professional right-handed baseball pitcher who in 1983 became the first pitcher to surpass Walter Johnson’s record of 3,508 career strikeouts, set in 1927. He retired in 1993 at age 46 with a record 5,714 strikeouts.
Ryan was taught to play baseball by an elder brother and was a wild but fast pitcher in high school before he was signed by the National League (NL) New York Mets in 1965. He pitched for their minor league teams (1965–67), and, except for time out for military service, he pitched regularly for the Mets through the 1971 season and was then traded to the American League (AL) California Angels. Although he pitched brilliantly in relief for the Mets in 1969 when they won the pennant and the World Series, he came into his own as a pitcher with the Angels, leading the league in strikeouts seven of his first eight years with them (1972–74, 1976, 1977–79). In 1980 he moved as a free agent to the NL Houston Astros, and he moved to the Texas Rangers in 1989.
