Alan Menken,  (born July 22, 1949, New Rochelle, New York, U.S.) American composer whose captivating scores helped invigorate the animated feature films of the Walt Disney Company.
As a young man, Menken enrolled in a premedical program at New York University but ultimately graduated with a degree in music. He then earned money by performing in clubs, composing advertising jingles, and providing accompaniment for ballerinas at practice. A career break came when playwright and lyricist Howard Ashman picked Menken to collaborate with him on the 1979 play God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, based on a novel by Kurt Vonnegut. Although they attained mild success with that production, it was not until 1982 that they achieved significant critical and commercial acclaim with the Off-Broadway production of Little Shop of Horrors. The duo subsequently adapted their score for the 1986 film.
