Ballroom dance, type of social dancing, originally practiced in Europe and the United States, that is performed by couples and follows prescribed steps. The tradition was historically distinguished from folk or country dance by its association with the elite social classes and with invitational dance events. In the 21st century, however, ballroom dance is present in many parts of the world and has practitioners in virtually all segments of society. It is performed in various contexts, including invitational and public dance events, professional dance exhibitions, and formal competitions.
Standard ballroom dances include the waltz and the polka from the 19th century and the fox-trot, the two-step, and the tango, among others, from the 20th century. Other popular dances—such as the Charleston, swing dancing, the mambo, the twist, and disco dancing—have also visited the ballroom repertoire at various points in the tradition’s history. Owing to the social and stylistic breadth of the ballroom tradition, the term ballroom dance has often been loosely applied to all sorts of social and popular dancing.
