Carol Burnett, in full Carol Creighton Burnett  (born April 26, 1933, San Antonio, Texas, U.S.) American comedian and actress who starred in a long-running eponymous television variety show in the 1960s and â€™70s.
As a young girl growing up during the Great Depression, Burnett spent many hours in movie theatres, developing a love for motion pictures and a desire to act. She studied acting at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in the 1950s, discovering in herself a natural ability to make audiences laugh. In 1955 a mysterious benefactor who enjoyed her work loaned her the money to move to New York City, where she eventually found work in television on the Winchell-Mahoney Show and, a year later, on the short-lived comedy Stanley, in which she portrayed the girlfriend of the character played by Buddy Hackett. A guest appearance with Garry Moore on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS)  Morning Show in 1956 led to increased exposure for the young comedian, and in 1959 Moore added Burnett to the cast of The Garry Moore Show. That same year, she received excellent reviews for her stage work in the Broadway musical comedy Once Upon a Mattress.
