Gourami,  any of several of the freshwater, tropical labyrinth fishes (order Perciformes), especially Osphronemus goramy, an East Indian fish that is caught or raised for food; it has been introduced elsewhere. This species is a compact, oval fish with a long, filamentous ray extending from each pelvic fin. It attains a weight of about 9 kg (20 pounds). As an adult, it is brown or gray with a paler belly; when young, it is dark-banded and reddish brown. It is the only member of the family Osphronemidae.
Other gourami, several of them popular in home aquariums, are Asian members of different genera and families. They are generally rather deep-bodied and small-mouthed. With the exception of the kissing gourami, sole member of the family Helostomatidae, they are of the family Belontiidae and are characterized by an elongated ray in each pelvic fin. Common species include the giant gourami (Osphronemus goramy), a blue-green and reddish brown fish 12 cm (4.75 inches) long; the dwarf gourami (Colisa lalia), 6 cm long, brightly striped in red and blue; the kissing gourami (Helostoma temmincki), a greenish or pinkish white fish noted for its “kissing” activities; and the three-spot, or blue, gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus), a dark-spotted, silvery or blue species.
