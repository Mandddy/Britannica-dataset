Peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), also called duck hawk,  the most widely distributed species of birds of prey, with breeding populations on every continent and many oceanic islands. Sixteen subspecies are recognized.
Coloration is a bluish gray above, with black bars on the white-to-yellowish-white underparts. Peregrines range from about 33 to 48 cm (13 to 19 inches) long. Strong and fast, they hunt by flying high and then diving at their prey. Attaining tremendous speeds (up to 320 km [200 miles] per hour), they strike with clenched talons and kill by impact. The prey includes ducks and shorebirds. Peregrines inhabit rocky open country near water where birds are plentiful. The usual nest is a mere scrape on a ledge high on a cliff, but a few populations use city skyscrapers or tree nests built by other bird species. The clutch is three or four reddish brown eggs, and incubation lasts about a month. The young fledge in five to six weeks.
