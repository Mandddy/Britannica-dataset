Vincenzo Scamozzi,  (born 1552, Vicenza, republic of Venice [Italy]â€”died  1616, Venice) Italian architect, architectural theorist, and stage designer of the late Renaissance.
Trained by his father, Bertotti Scamozzi, he studied in Venice and Rome and traveled widely through western Europe. The classicizing influence of Andrea Palladio and Sebastiano Serlio is evident in the palaces, villas, and churches that Scamozzi designed in Venice, Vicenza, Padua, and elsewhere in Italy. His designs for villas and town palaces, which were sometimes adaptations of buildings by Palladio, influenced English Neoclassical architecture from Inigo Jones onward.
