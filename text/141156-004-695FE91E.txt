Atmospheric optics, study of optical characteristics and phenomena associated with the interaction of visible sunlight with atmospheric gases, particulates, and water vapour. Refraction, diffraction, Rayleigh scattering, and polarization of light are within the compass of atmospheric optics; the phenomena studied include rainbows, halos, atmospheric corona, mirages, and sundogs (see parhelion).
