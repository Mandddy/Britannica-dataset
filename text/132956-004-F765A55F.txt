Fred Rogers, in full Fred McFeely Rogers, byname Mister Rogers  (born March 20, 1928, Latrobe, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died February 27, 2003, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) American television host, producer, and writer best known for his public television program, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood (1968–2001).
Following graduation (1951) from Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida, with a degree in musical composition, Rogers worked first for NBC in New York City and then for the public television station WQED in Pittsburgh. In 1954 he began what became a seven-year run of writing, producing, and serving as puppeteer for The Children’s Corner; 30 segments of the show were broadcast on NBC in 1955–56. He earned (1962) a divinity degree from the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and was ordained by the Presbyterian Church, which asked him to continue his television work. Rogers made his on-camera debut in 1963 on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s Misterogers and in 1966 returned to WQED, where the show became Misterogers’ Neighborhood. By 1968 it was being distributed nationally by National Educational Television (NET). After the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) succeeded NET in 1970, the program was renamed Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. Mr. Rogers began each episode by changing into one of his trademark cardigan sweaters while singing the show’s theme song, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”
