Otto Erich Hartleben,  (born June 3, 1864, Clausthal, Hanover—died  Feb. 11, 1905, Salò, Italy) German poet, dramatist, and short-story writer known for his Naturalistic dramas that portray with ironic wit the weaknesses of middle-class society.
Hartleben studied law and held minor judicial appointments and then, from 1890, lived a bohemian life as a free-lance writer. The most popular of his dramas was the tragedy Rosenmontag (1900; Love’s Carnival, 1904), which portrays the tragedy of a Prussian officer in love with a working class girl. Social criticism in his works gave way to humorous anecdote, satire, and eroticism reminiscent of Guy de Maupassant, as seen in the tales Vom gastfreien Pastor (1895; “From the Hospitable Pastor”). He also wrote graceful, though superficial, poetry in an impressionistic style, collected in Meine Verse (1905; “My Verses”).
