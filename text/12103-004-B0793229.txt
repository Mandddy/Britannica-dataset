John Elliotson,  (born Oct. 29, 1791, Southwark, London, Eng.—died  July 29, 1868, London) English physician who advocated the use of hypnosis in therapy and who in 1849 founded a mesmeric hospital. He was one of the first teachers in London to emphasize clinical lecturing and was one of the earliest of British physicians to urge use of the stethoscope.
After studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh, at the University of Cambridge, and in London hospitals, Elliotson taught at London University (now University College). In 1834 he became physician to University College Hospital, where his interest in hypnosis led to conflicts with the hospital’s medical committee and his resignation in 1838.
