Shirley MacLaine, original name Shirley MacLean Beaty  (born April 24, 1934, Richmond, Virginia, U.S.) outspoken American actress and dancer known for her deft portrayal of charmingly eccentric characters and for her interest in mysticism and reincarnation.
After graduating from high school, MacLaine, who had studied ballet since age three, moved to New York City, where she worked as a dancer and model. In 1954 she was hired as a chorus girl and understudy to the second lead, Carol Haney, in the hit Broadway musical The Pajama Game. When Haney broke her ankle, MacLaine took over the role and was “discovered” by film producer Hal Wallis, who put her under contract.
