Petrified Forest National Park, desert area containing plant and animal fossils and archaeological sites in eastern Arizona, U.S., 19 miles (30 km) east of Holbrook. It was established as a national monument in 1906 and as a national park in 1962. The area within the park proper is 146 square miles (378 square km), but, since 2005, additional land parcels have been acquired and placed under park administration, so that the entire protected area now totals 346 square miles (896 square km).
The park consists of two unequal-size areas, north and south, joined by a narrow neck of land near the park’s north entrance. The southern portion, the larger of the two, includes extensive areas east and west of the park proper that are now administered by the park but that are still privately owned. The northern lobe of the park lies largely within the southeastern extension of the Painted Desert, a badlands region of colourful wind-eroded hills. Pilot Rock (6,235 feet [1,900 metres]), in the northwestern corner of the northern lobe, is the park’s highest point. Much of the northern lobe is designated as a wilderness area.
