Ludwig Erhard,  (born February 4, 1897, Fürth, Germany—died May 5, 1977, Bonn, West Germany) economist and statesman who, as economics minister (1949–63), was the chief architect of West Germany’s post-World War II economic recovery. He served as German chancellor from 1963 to 1966.
Following World War I, Erhard studied economics, eventually joining an economics research institute. Because he was untainted by Nazi associations, he was entrusted by the postwar Allied occupation authorities with the reconstruction of industry in the Nürnberg-Fürth area. Thereafter he served successively as economics adviser in Middle and Upper Franconia, economics minister for Bavaria (1945–46), director of the Advisory Committee for Money and Credit (1947–48), and director of the economic council for the joint Anglo-U.S. occupation zone (1948–49). By the end of 1948 the currency reforms that he had instituted the preceding summer, coupled with the abolition of rationing and of other commercial restrictions, had already somewhat buoyed the prostrate German economy.
