James Northcote, in full Thomas James Northcote   (born Oct. 22, 1746, Plymouth, Devon, Eng.â€”died  July 13, 1831, London) English portraitist and historical painter.
Northcote was apprenticed to his father, a poor watchmaker of Plymouth, and, during his spare hours, learned to use paintbrush and pencil. In 1769 he left his father and started as a portrait painter. Four years later he went to London and was admitted as a pupil into the studio and house of the great portraitist Sir Joshua Reynolds. In 1775 he left Reynolds, and about two years later, having acquired the necessary funds by portrait painting in Devon, he went to study in Italy. After his return to England three years later he settled (1781) in London, where John Opie and Henry Fuseli were his rivals. He was elected an associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1786 and full academician the following spring.
