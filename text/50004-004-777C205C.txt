Anvil, iron block on which metal is placed to be shaped, originally by hand with a hammer. The blacksmith’s anvil is usually of wrought iron, but sometimes of cast iron, with a smooth working surface of hardened steel. A projecting conical beak, or horn, at one end is used for hammering curved pieces of metal. Sometimes the other end has a beak with a rectangular section. Tools such as the anvil cutter or chisel can be placed cutting edge uppermost into a holder consisting of a square hole in the anvil’s surface. When power hammers are used, the anvil is supported on a heavy block, which in turn rests on a strong foundation of timber and masonry or concrete.
