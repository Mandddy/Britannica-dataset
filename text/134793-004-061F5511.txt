Friedrich von Hügel, baron von Hügel,  (born May 5, 1852, Florence [Italy]—died  Jan. 27, 1925, London, Eng.) Roman Catholic philosopher and author who was the forerunner of the realist revival in philosophy and the theological study of religious feeling.
Of Austrian descent, von Hügel inherited his father’s baronial title in 1870 but lived most of his life (1876–1925) in England, where he married a sister of the 13th Earl of Pembroke and, at the outbreak of World War I, assumed British citizenship (1914). He customarily styled himself Baron von Hügel.
