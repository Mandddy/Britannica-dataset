Frederick Mark Becket,  (born Jan. 11, 1875, Montreal, Que., Can.â€”died  Dec. 1, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.) metallurgist who developed a process of using silicon instead of carbon as a reducing agent in metal production, thus making low-carbon ferroalloys and certain steels practical.
After graduating (1895) from McGill University, Montreal, Becket attended Columbia University, New York City, and embarked on a career of utilizing electrical energy in the production of metals and chemicals. He joined the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in 1906, rising eventually to a vice presidency and spending his last years as a consultant. He pioneered in the use of the electric furnace in the production of ferrovanadium, ferromanganese, ferromolybdenum, ferrotungsten, and low-carbon ferrochromium, an essential ingredient of stainless steel. During World War I he made possible tonnage production of ferrozirconium, previously unavailable, and speeded production of silicon for use in making steel shells and aluminum alloys for aviation use. More than 100 patents, covering a wide range of electric furnace and chemical products, were issued to him.
