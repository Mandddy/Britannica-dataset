Chicago fire of 1871, also called  Great Chicago Fire,  conflagration that began on October 8, 1871, and burned until early October 10, devastating an expansive swath of the city of Chicago.
Chicagoâ€™s growth in the mid-19th century was unprecedented. The population reached nearly 30,000 in 1850 and was triple that a decade later. Cheap transportation to the outskirts of the city encouraged middle-class dispersal, but poor neighbourhoods near the downtown area were congested; structures there were also built of wood. Serious fires were frequent, but none would compare to the one started on October 8, 1871. Months without rain had parched the city, and a major fire the previous night had exhausted firefighters and damaged equipment.
