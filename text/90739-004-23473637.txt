The Misfits, American film drama, released in 1961, that is perhaps best remembered as the final movie of screen legends Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable.
The Misfits, directed by John Huston, is a contemporary tale of the West that centres on aging cowboys. Out of their element in the modern world, they now herd wild “misfit” horses from their trucks and sell them to be killed and cheaply sold as pet food. Monroe played a troubled ex-stripper who falls in love with Gable’s cowboy character but is appalled at the capture and fate of these once-free animals. The parallel in the plot is thinly disguised: the hopeless plight of the horses mirrors that of their captors.
