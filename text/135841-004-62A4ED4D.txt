PayPal, American e-commerce company formed in March 2000 that specializes in Internet money transfers. It was heavily used with and eventually purchased by the Internet auction company eBay. Paypal was the product of a merger between X.com and Confinity, and it allowed users to make payments on purchased goods or exchange money between accounts in a secure online transaction.
After watching PayPal become the premier choice of Internet auction shoppers, online marketplace giant eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion in October 2002. The company offers users the ability to link their PayPal accounts to their own bank accounts, making transfers and payments more efficient than money orders or checks. Fees are collected by eBay on certain transactions and are determined based on the amount of the transaction, the nature of the transaction, and the currency type of the transaction.
