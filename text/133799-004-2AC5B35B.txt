Oskar Maria Graf,  (born July 22, 1894, Berg am Starnberger See, Ger.—died  June 28, 1967, New York, N.Y., U.S.) German regional novelist and poet known for novels and sketches of Bavarian peasant life, such as Kalender-Geschichten, 2 vol. (1929, rev. 1957; “Calendar Stories”). Graf’s writing is marked by frank realism and by his own socialist and pacifist beliefs, but these are tempered by humorous affection for his subjects.
An apprentice baker, Graf went to Munich in 1911, where he supported himself with a variety of menial jobs. Drafted into military service, he was a soldier at the Russian front during World War I. He joined a revolutionary socialist group and participated in a strike by munitions workers and in the November Revolution that resulted in the short-lived Socialist Republic of Bavaria. After its demise in 1919, Graf worked as a director for the Munich Workers’ Theatre before turning to writing. In 1933 Graf fled Germany for Vienna and later for Czechoslovakia, and in 1938 he left Europe and eventually settled in New York.
