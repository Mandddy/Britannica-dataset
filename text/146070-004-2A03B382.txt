George Crabbe,  (born December 24, 1754, Aldeburgh, Suffolk, England—died February 3, 1832, Trowbridge, Wiltshire) English writer of poems and verse tales memorable for their realistic details of everyday life.
Crabbe grew up in the then-impoverished seacoast village of Aldeburgh, where his father was collector of salt duties, and he was apprenticed to a surgeon at 14. Hating his mean surroundings and unsuccessful occupation, he abandoned both in 1780 and went to London. In 1781 he wrote a desperate letter of appeal to Edmund Burke, who read Crabbe’s writings and persuaded James Dodsley to publish one of his didactic, descriptive poems, The Library (1781). Burke also used his influence to have Crabbe accepted for ordination, and in 1782 he became chaplain to the duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle.
