Work, in economics and sociology, the activities and labour necessary to the survival of society.
The major activities of early humans were the hunting and gathering of food and the care and rearing of children. As early as 40,000 bce, hunters began to work in groups to track and kill animals. Other members of society were more naturally suited to gathering food. It seems likely that women, because of the requirements of pregnancy and nursing, did not generally participate in hunting, but womenâ€™s work in gathering likely yielded more food value than did hunting.
