Billy Collins, in full William James Collins  (born March 22, 1941, New York, New York, U.S.) American poet whose uncommonly accessible verse—characterized by plain language, gentle humour, and an alert appreciation for the mundane—made him one of the most popular poets in the United States.
Collins grew up mainly in Queens, New York. He wrote his first poem at age 12 and later joined his high-school literary magazine. In 1963 Collins received a B.A. from the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts, and he went on to earn a doctorate in Romantic poetry from the University of California, Riverside, in 1971. That year he also began a lengthy career as a professor of English at Lehman College, Bronx, New York. During the 1970s he wrote a number of short counterculture-inspired poems for Rolling Stone magazine and, through a small press, published his first book of poetry, Pokerface (1977).
