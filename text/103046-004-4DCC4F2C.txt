Tom Brady, in full Thomas Edward Patrick Brady, Jr.  (born August 3, 1977, San Mateo, California, U.S.) American gridiron football quarterback, who led the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) to four Super Bowl victories (2002, 2004, 2005, and 2015) and was named the game’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times (2002, 2004, and 2015).
While growing up, Brady often attended San Francisco 49ers games to watch the legendary quarterback Joe Montana—Brady’s idol and the man to whom he would eventually be compared—play during the 1980s. In high school Brady excelled in both football and baseball. He entered the Major League Baseball draft in 1995 and was picked by the Montreal Expos, but he decided instead to attend the University of Michigan and play football. Brady, who did not start until his junior year, led Michigan to victory in the 1999 Orange Bowl and gained a reputation as a determined and intelligent player but one who lacked any exceptional physical skills. In 2000 he was chosen in the sixth round of the NFL draft by New England, and he worked diligently during his first season to bulk up physically and improve his strength and technique.
