Günther’s earliest studies in sculpture were likely with his father, a carpenter and cabinetmaker. He studied in Munich with Johann Baptist Straub, with Paul Egell in Mannheim, and eventually, in 1753, at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. His graduation piece, Aeneas Carrying His Father, Anchises, out of Troy (now lost), won first prize.
