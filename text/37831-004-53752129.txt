August Ferdinand Möbius,  (born November 17, 1790, Schulpforta, Saxony [Germany]—died September 26, 1868, Leipzig) German mathematician and theoretical astronomer who is best known for his work in analytic geometry and in topology. In the latter field he is especially remembered as one of the discoverers of the Möbius strip.
Möbius entered the University of Leipzig in 1809 and soon decided to concentrate on mathematics, astronomy, and physics. From 1813 to 1814 he studied theoretical astronomy under Carl Friedrich Gauss at the University of Göttingen. He then studied mathematics at the University of Halle before he obtained a position as a professor of astronomy at Leipzig in 1816. From 1818 to 1821 Möbius supervised the construction of the university’s observatory, and in 1848 he was appointed its director.
