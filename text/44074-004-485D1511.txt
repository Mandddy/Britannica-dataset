Capricornus, (
        Latin: “Goat-horned”) , also called the Goat,  in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the southern sky between Aquarius and Sagittarius, at about 21 hours right ascension and 20° south declination. Its stars are faint; Deneb Algedi (Arabic for “kid’s tail”) is the brightest star, with a magnitude of 2.9.
In astrology, Capricornus (also called Capricorn) is the 10th sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about December 22 to about January 19. One explanation of the fishtail with which the goat is often represented is found in the Greek myth of Pan, who, to avoid the monster Typhon, jumped into the water just as he was changing into animal shape. The half above water assumed the shape of a goat while the lower half, the tail, assumed the shape of a fish.
