Adena culture,  culture of various communities of ancient North American Indians, about 500 bcâ€“ad 100, centred in what is now southern Ohio. Groups in Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, and possibly Pennsylvania bear similarities and are roughly grouped with the Adena culture. (The term Adena derives from the home of an early Ohio governor, located near Chillicothe, Ohio, around which Adena-type mounds were found.)
The Adena usually lived in villages containing circular houses with conical roofs, constructed of poles, willows, and bark, though some of them lived in rock shelters. They subsisted by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plant foods. Their utensils consisted of such items as stone hoes, axes, and projectiles, stone smoking pipes, and simple pottery. Adena ornaments of copper, mica, and seashells attest to trade with faraway peoples.
