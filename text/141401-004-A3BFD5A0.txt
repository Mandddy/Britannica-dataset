Motor-paced race,  in bicycle racing, a form of competition in which each bicycle racer competes behind a motorbike or motorcycle. (Originally, racers followed tandem bicycles or multicycles.) The bicycles used have small front wheels, enabling the rider to move close to a freely moving roller on a bar projecting from the rear of the pacing motorbike and thus to take full advantage of the air currents created by the motorbikeâ€™s passage. The technique requires excellent teamwork by both the motorcyclist and the racer to keep from becoming separated and thereby losing ground. Speeds may average better than 60 kilometres (40 miles) per hour in a 100-kilometre (62.1-mile) race.
