Bob Fosse, byname of Robert Louis Fosse   (born June 23, 1927, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died September 23, 1987, Washington, D.C.) American dancer, choreographer, and director who revolutionized musicals with his distinct style of dance—including his frequent use of props, signature moves, and provocative steps—and was well known for eschewing light comedic story lines for darker and more-introspective plots. He began on the stage, where he worked on such notable productions as Sweet Charity (1966–67; 1986–87) and Chicago (1975–77) and later had a successful, though brief, film career, which was highlighted by Cabaret (1972).
Fosse, who was the son of a vaudevillian, attended dance schools as a child and began dancing professionally at the age of 13. Following high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to an entertainment unit. After his discharge in 1947, he moved to New York, where he studied acting at the American Theatre Wing while dancing as a team with his first wife, Mary Ann Niles, onstage and in such TV shows as Your Hit Parade. After participating in some national tours, he made his Broadway debut in the chorus of Dance Me a Song (1950). In 1952–53 he was the understudy for the title role in Pal Joey and took over the part on tour.
