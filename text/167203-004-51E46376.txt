Charlize Theron,  (born August 7, 1975, Benoni, South Africa) South African-born actress, who was noted for her versatility and earned an Academy Award for best actress for her performance as a real-life serial killer in Monster (2003).
Theron grew up on a farm near Benoni, South Africa. At age 13, wanting to continue her ballet studies, she began attending a boarding school that specialized in the arts. During a visit home when she was 15, her mother shot and killed her father in self-defense after being attacked by him while he was drunk. At age 16 Theron moved to Milan to work as a model. Two years later she settled in New York City, where she continued to model and began studying at the Joffrey Ballet School. A knee injury ended her chances of a career in dance, however, and she attempted, unsuccessfully, to pursue acting jobs.
