Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, megye (county), northern Hungary. It is bounded by Slovakia to the north and northwest and by the counties of Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg to the east, Hajdú-Bihar to the southeast, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok to the south, and Heves and Nógrád to the southwest. Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén is one of the most-populous and most-industrialized counties in Hungary. Miskolc is the county seat. Major cities include Miskolc, Edelény, Kazinbarcika, Mezőkövesd, Ózd, Sárospatak, Szerencs, Sátoraljaújhely, Tiszaújváros, and Tokaj.
The terrain is mostly hilly with riverine lowlands created by streams flowing north-south from Slovakia to the Tisza River. Several of these in upper Borsod have been dammed for flood control and storage. The natural vegetation covering the mountains is a mix of Subcarpathian flora and the characteristic vegetation of the Great Alfold (Great Hungarian Plain, or Nagy Magyar Alföld). There are several protected species, including the ostrich fern and Iris hungarica. The Aggtelek Caves, located on the Hungarian-Slovakian border about 30 miles (50 km) northwest of Miskolc, rank as one of Europe’s largest underground cave systems, with subterranean lakes and limestone formations. The caves and their surroundings were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995.
