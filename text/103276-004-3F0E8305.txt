Wexford, Irish Loch Garman,  county in the province of Leinster, southeastern Ireland. It is bounded on the east and south by the Irish Sea and from west to north by Counties Kilkenny, Carlow, and Wicklow. The town of Wexford, on the Irish Sea coast, is the county seat, and there is a county manager.
The Blackstairs Mountains—which have two main peaks, Blackstairs Mountain (2,402 feet [732 metres]) and Mount Leinster (2,602 feet [793 metres])—form a striking range rising from lowlands on all sides. Between the two main summits is the deep Scullogue Gap. Most of the county consists of a lowland between the mountains and the sea, with a maximum width of about 20 miles (30 km) and scattered hills of igneous rock and several hills over 1,000 feet (300 metres) high. Much of the lowland is covered with glacial deposits, including the moraine formed during the last glaciation of Ireland. The coast is composed of wide, sweeping bays with rocky headlands, sand dunes, and cliffs.
