John Robinson Pierce,  (born March 27, 1910, Des Moines, Iowa, U.S.â€”died April 2, 2002, Sunnyvale, California) American communications engineer, scientist, and father of the communications satellite.
Pierce attended the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, receiving his Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1936. That year he began working for Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., New York City. He improved the traveling-wave tube, which is used as a broadband amplifier of microwaves, and designed a new electrostatically focused electron-multiplier tube, used as a sensitive radiation detector. His Pierce electron gun produces high-density electron beams. During World War II he collaborated on the low-voltage reflex klystron oscillator that was almost universally used in U.S. radar receivers. In 1948 Pierce coined the term transistor to describe the new solid-state device invented at Bell Laboratories.
