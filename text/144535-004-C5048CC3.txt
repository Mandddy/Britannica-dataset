Halite, naturally occurring sodium chloride (NaCl), common or rock salt. Halite occurs on all continents in beds that range from a few metres to more than 300 m (1,000 feet) in thickness. Termed evaporite deposits because they formed by the evaporation of saline water in partially enclosed basins, they characteristically are associated with beds of limestone, dolomite, and shale. Halite also occurs as a sublimation product in volcanic regions, an efflorescence in arid regions, and an evaporation product near salt springs. Deformation of halite beds sometimes results in the extrusion of plugs of salt through overlying sediment, as in salt domes and diapirs. Halite is found in large deposits in southeastern Russia; Dax, Fr.; Punjab, India; Ontario, Canada; and New York, Texas, and Louisiana, U.S. For detailed physical properties, see halide mineral (table).
