Assiniboine River, river in southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada, a major tributary of the Red River. From its source in eastern Saskatchewan, it flows southeastward into Manitoba and thence eastward through a break in the Manitoba Cuesta, an escarpment, to the lowlands formed in ancient times by glacial Lake Agassiz; there it joins the Red River at Winnipeg, after a course of 665 mi (1,070 km). Explored by the French voyageur Pierre de La Vérendrye, in 1736 the Assiniboine subsequently served as an important route for fur traders. It is named after the Assiniboine Indians (meaning “those who cook with hot stones”). Along with its two chief tributaries, the Qu’Appelle and Souris rivers, the Assiniboine drains one of Canada’s major wheat-growing regions. Major riparian cities include Brandon, Portage la Prairie (La Vérendrye’s Fort La Reine was built there in 1738), and Winnipeg, which are in Manitoba.
