The Hague, Dutch ’s-Gravenhage or Den Haag, French La Haye,  seat of government of the Netherlands. It is situated on a coastal plain, with the city centre just inland from the North Sea. The Hague is the administrative capital of the country and the home of the court and government, though Amsterdam is the official capital.
The city’s name recalls the hunting lodge of the counts of Holland, which was located in a woodland area called Haghe, or “hedge” (whence ’s-Gravenhage, “the counts’ private enclosure”). Count William II built a castle there in 1248, around which several buildings—including the Knights’ Hall (1280)—came to be clustered, and these became the principal residence of the counts of Holland. These buildings now form the Binnenhof (“Inner Courtyard”) in the old quarter of the city. About 1350 an artificial lake, the Hofvijver, was dug just to the north of the Binnenhof and still forms one of the many attractions of the city.
