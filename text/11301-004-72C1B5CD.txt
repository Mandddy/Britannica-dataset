Jacques-Salomon Hadamard,  (born December 8, 1865, Versailles, France—died October 17, 1963, Paris) French mathematician who proved the prime number theorem, which states that as n approaches infinity, π(n) approaches n/ln&nbsp;n, where π(n) is the number of positive prime numbers not greater than n.
The Hadamard family moved to Paris in 1869, just before the beginning of the Franco-German War. In 1884 Hadamard took first place in entrance exams for both the École Polytechnique and the École Normale Supérieure. He chose to study mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1888 and a doctorate in 1892. The latter year was particulary significant for Hadamard: he was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques for his paper “Determination of the Number of Primes Less than a Given Number,” and he married his childhood sweetheart. The following year he was appointed to a lecturership at the University of Bordeaux; he became a professor of astronomy and rational mechanics there in 1896.
