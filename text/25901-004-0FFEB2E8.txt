Edwin Arlington Robinson,  (born Dec. 22, 1869, Head Tide, Maine, U.S.—died  April 6, 1935, New York, N.Y.) American poet who is best known for his short dramatic poems concerning the people in a small New England village, Tilbury Town, very much like the Gardiner, Maine, in which he grew up.
After his family suffered financial reverses, Robinson cut short his attendance at Harvard University (1891–93) and returned to Gardiner to stay with his family, whose fortunes were disintegrating. The lives of both his brothers ended in failure and early death, and Robinson’s poetry is much concerned with personal defeat and the tragic complexities of life. Robinson himself endured years of poverty and obscurity before his poetry began to attract notice.
