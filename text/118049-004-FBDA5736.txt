Marks &amp; Spencer PLC, also known as M&amp;S,  one of the largest British retail clothing and food companies. Headquarters of the firm are in London.
Marks &amp; Spencer started in 1884 as a stall in an open market in Leeds, Yorkshire. Then known as Marks’ Penny Bazaar, it was the household goods, haberdashery, toy, and sheet-music business of Michael Marks, a Jewish refugee from Poland. His sign read “Don’t ask the price—it’s a penny.” In 1894 he took Thomas Spencer as a business partner. Marks’s son Simon transformed the business from a number of outdoor stalls in various markets in northern England to a number of indoor shops, and he launched the company’s St. Michael brand name—a popular label for decades. In 1988 the parent firm, Marks and Spencer Group PLC, purchased Brooks Brothers, the oldest U.S. clothing retailer, but it sold that division in 2001. By this time the company operated more than 300 retail outlets in the United Kingdom—known colloquially as “Marks and Sparks”—with additional stores in dozens of other countries, including France, Germany, Spain, and Hong Kong; a decade later the number of U.K. shops had more than doubled to some 700.
