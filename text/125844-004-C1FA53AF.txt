Petrel, any of a number of seabirds of the order Procellariiformes, particularly certain members of the family Procellariidae, which also includes the fulmars and the shearwaters. Members of the family Hydrobatidae are increasingly called storm petrels; those of the Pelecanoididae are usually called diving petrels (see diving petrel; storm petrel).
Among the procellariid petrels, some two dozen species of the genera Pterodroma and Bulweria are called gadfly petrels because their flight is more fluttering than that of the related shearwaters (see shearwater). Certain heavy-bodied petrels are known as fulmars, and one, Macronectes giganteus, is called both giant fulmar and giant petrel (see fulmar).
