Expressway, also called throughway, thruway, parkway, freeway, superhighway, or motorway,  major arterial divided highway that features two or more traffic lanes in each direction, with opposing traffic separated by a median strip; elimination of grade crossings; controlled entries and exits; and advanced designs eliminating steep grades, sharp curves, and other hazards and inconveniences to driving. Frequently expressways have been constructed over completely new routes, passing near but not through large centres of population, on more or less direct lines between desired termini. Their advantages include high speed, greater safety, comfort and convenience for drivers and passengers, and lower vehicle operating costs. Many of these new express highways, especially in the United States, are toll roads, but that is an incidental, not an essential, feature.
In 1924 Italy began the construction of toll motor highways, or autostrade, that soon totaled 320 miles (515 km) in length. Although these did not attain the standards of later express highways, they did incorporate the features of limited access and elimination of grade crossings. They were built and owned by private companies and paid for by tolls and advertising. The first true express highways, the autobahns, were built in Germany. Although the idea originated and plans were formulated between 1930 and 1932, a national network, the Reichsautobahnen, totaling 1,310 miles (2,110 km) by 1942, was built by the Nazi regime for both economic and military purposes. The only other European country to undertake construction of express highways before World War II was the Netherlands. In the United States the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut were completed shortly before the nationâ€™s entrance into the war in 1941.
