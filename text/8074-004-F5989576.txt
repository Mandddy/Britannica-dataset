Anatosaurus (genus Anatosaurus), subsumes Trachodon ,  bipedal duck-billed dinosaurs (hadrosaurs) of the Late Cretaceous Period, commonly found as fossils in North American rocks 70 million to 65 million years old. Related forms such as Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus have been found elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere.
Anatosaurus grew to a length of 9–12 metres (30–40 feet) and was heavily built. The skull was long and the beak broad and flat, much like a duck’s bill. As in all iguanodontids and hadrosaurs, there were no teeth in the beak itself, which was covered by a horny sheath. However, several hundred rather blunt teeth were arranged in rows along the sides of the cheeks at any given time. There were dozens of teeth along each row, and several rows of exposed and partially worn replacement teeth were present behind the outer teeth. Not all were functional simultaneously, but, as teeth became worn or lost, they were replaced continually by new ones.
