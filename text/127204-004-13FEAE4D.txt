Juan Diego Flórez,  (born Jan. 13, 1973, Lima, Peru) Peruvian opera singer, widely acclaimed for his command of the high tenor range.
Flórez, whose father was a performer of popular music, entered Peru’s National Conservatory of Music at age 17. He was originally interested in popular music but later shifted his focus to the development of his classical vocal technique. He received a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, which he attended from 1993 to 1996, and he then studied with the Peruvian tenor Ernesto Palacio, who subsequently became his manager. Flórez’s first break came in 1996 when on short notice he replaced a singer in Matilde di Shabran at the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Italy. He made his debut at La Scala in Milan later that year and at Covent Garden in London the next year. Within a few years he was singing in other major opera houses and on concert stages throughout Europe and the Americas.
