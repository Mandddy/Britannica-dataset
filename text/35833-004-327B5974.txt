Kukri snake (genus Oligodon), any of 50 to 60 species of snakes of the family Colubridae. The snakes are named for their enlarged hind teeth, which are broad and curved like the Gurkha sword of the same name. They occur in East and South Asia.
All kukri snakes are egg layers, and most are less than 90 cm (35 inches) long. They feed largely on bird and reptile eggs.
