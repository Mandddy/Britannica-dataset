Charles Ives, in full Charles Edward Ives  (born October 20, 1874, Danbury, Connecticut, U.S.—died May 19, 1954, New York City) significant American composer who is known for a number of innovations that anticipated most of the later musical developments of the 20th century.
Ives received his earliest musical instruction from his father, who was a bandleader, music teacher, and acoustician who experimented with the sound of quarter tones. At 12 Charles played organ in a local church, and two years later his first composition was played by the town band. In 1893 or 1894 he composed “Song for the Harvest Season,” in which the four parts—for voice, trumpet, violin, and organ—were in different keys. That year he began studying at Yale University under Horatio Parker, then the foremost academic composer in the United States. His unconventionality disconcerted Parker, for whom Ives eventually turned out a series of “correct” compositions.
