Boarfish, (family Caproidae), any of six species of fishes (order Zeiformes) characterized by red coloration and a laterally compressed body that is as high as it is long. All six species live in deep marine waters, occurring in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. The two genera, Antigonia and Capros, are placed in different subfamilies. A typical species, A. capros, reaches a length of about 18 cm (7 inches).
Boarfishes typically have three anal spines that are completely separated from the soft rays of the anal fin. When viewed from the side, boarfishes appear almost rhomboid, or diamond-shaped, owing to the angular profiles of their backs.
