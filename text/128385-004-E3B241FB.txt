Mist, suspension in the atmosphere of very tiny water droplets (50–500 microns in diameter) or wet hygroscopic particles that reduces horizontal visibility to 1 km (0.6 mile) or more; if the visibility is reduced below 1 km, the suspension is called a fog. Mist appears to cover the landscape with a thin, grayish veil. In the United States the term mist is sometimes used loosely to designate a drizzle, a very light precipitation composed of small water droplets (200–500 microns in diameter) falling to the ground. In Scotland and parts of England, a combination of thick mist or fog and heavy drizzle is called Scotch mist.
