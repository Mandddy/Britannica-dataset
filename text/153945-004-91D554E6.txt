Lilies of the Field, American film drama, released in 1963, that explores issues of faith and is especially noted for Sidney Poitier’s historic Academy Award win: he became the first African American to win an Oscar for best actor.
In the film, which was based on William E. Barrett’s novel of the same name, Poitier portrays Homer Smith, a wandering ex-GI who encounters an order of German nuns in Arizona. The nuns persuade him to perform odd jobs on their farm, and the tough-as-nails mother superior (played by Lilia Skala) eventually enlists his help in building a chapel. Despite several setbacks, he completes the chapel and in the process earns the respect and admiration of the nuns and the local townspeople.
