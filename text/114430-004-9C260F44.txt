Andre Agassi, in full Andre Kirk Agassi  (born April 29, 1970, Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.) American professional tennis player who won eight Grand Slam titles, as well as the “career Grand Slam” for winning each of the four major tennis tournaments—Wimbledon, the Australian Open, the French Open, and the U.S. Open—at least once.
By age 2 he could serve a tennis ball on a full court. At 13 he was sent to a tennis academy in Bradenton, Florida, run by Nick Bolletieri, who later became his coach. In 1987 Agassi won his first professional tournament. With six tournament wins in 1988, the shaggy-haired right-hander with the powerful forehand began attracting attention. Agassi’s charisma, flashy on-court wardrobe, and good looks made him a media sensation, and the tagline of one of the products he endorsed—“Image is everything”—came to stand as shorthand for the perception of Agassi among some tennis fans. He further annoyed tennis traditionalists by refusing to play at Wimbledon because of the event’s dress code and the grass surfaces of its courts.
