Francis X. Bushman, in full Francis Xavier Bushman  (born January 10, 1883, Baltimore, Md., U.S.—died August 23, 1966, Pacific Palisades, Calif.) American actor who in his heyday was advertised as “the Handsomest Man in the World.”
Though his father wanted him to be a doctor, Bushman was bitten by the acting bug in childhood and played walk-on roles in various Baltimore stock companies. In 1903 he won a local strongman’s contest, which led to several years’ steady work as a sculptor’s model. After attending Maryland’s Ammendale College, he launched his professional acting career, making his Broadway debut in 1908. While performing in Chicago in 1911, he was invited to make films with the Essanay company. Rapidly ascending to stardom, he was signed to a contract stipulating that his wife and children not be publicized, so as not to spoil his image as an “accessible” screen lover. Accordingly, the studio listed his birthplace as Norfolk, Virginia, to throw researchers off the track.
