Michael Pacher,  (born c. 1435, County of Tirol—died  August 1498, Salzburg?, Archbishopric of Salzburg) late Gothic painter and wood-carver, one of the earliest artists to introduce the principles of Renaissance painting into Germany.
Little is known of Pacher’s early life, but he is thought to have gone to Italy, where he was much impressed by the experiments in perspective of two eminent northern Italian artists of the Renaissance, Jacopo Bellini and Andrea Mantegna. That trip must have occurred sometime before Pacher began work on the St. Wolfgang altarpiece of the Pilgrimage Church of Sankt Wolfgang in Upper Austria (centre completed in 1479; wings completed in 1481). The large figures placed close to the picture plane and seen from a low viewpoint, the deep architectural perspective, and the dramatic foreshortening in such scenes as the “Expulsion of the Money Changers from the Temple” and the “Nativity” betray knowledge of Mantegna’s frescoes in the Church of the Eremitani in Padua. Pacher, however, rejected Mantegna’s statuesque compositions in favour of a dynamic sense of movement. In contrast to the painted wings, the carved and painted centre of the altarpiece, showing the “Coronation of the Virgin,” exhibits no Italian characteristics. Instead, its intricate carving that accentuates minute detail, the bright polychrome and sweeping draperies are wholly northern in spirit.
