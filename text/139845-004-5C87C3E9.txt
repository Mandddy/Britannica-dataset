Themis, (
        Greek: “Order”) in Greek religion, personification of justice, goddess of wisdom and good counsel, and the interpreter of the gods’ will. According to Hesiod’s Theogony, she was the daughter of Uranus (Heaven) and Gaea (Earth), although at times she was apparently identified with Gaea, as in Aeschylus’s Eumenides and Prometheus Bound. In Hesiod she is Zeus’s second consort and by him the mother of the Horae (see Hora), the Moirai, and, in some traditions, the Hesperides. On Olympus, Themis maintained order and supervised the ceremonial. She was a giver of oracles; Aeschylus relates in Eumenides that she once owned the oracle at Delphi but later gave it to Apollo. In the lost epic Cypria, she plans the Trojan War with Zeus to remedy overpopulation.
The cult of Themis was widespread in Greece. She was often represented as a woman of sober appearance carrying a pair of scales.
