Pack ice, also known as ice pack or pack,  any area of sea ice (ice formed by freezing of seawater) that is not landfast; it is mobile by virtue of not being attached to the shoreline or something else. Pack ice expands in the winter and retreats in the summer in both hemispheres to cover about 5 percent of the northern oceans and 8 percent of the southern oceans. See also sea ice.
