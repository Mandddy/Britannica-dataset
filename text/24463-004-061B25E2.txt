Josef Dobrovský,  (born August 17, 1753, Gyarmat, Hungary—died January 6, 1829, Brno, Moravia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]) scholar of the Czech language, antiquary, and a principal founder of comparative Slavic linguistics.
Educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood, Dobrovský devoted himself to scholarship after the temporary dissolution of the Jesuit order in 1773. He was tireless in his research on ancient Slavic manuscripts, and he traveled widely, notably to Russia and Sweden in 1792, in search of works removed during the Thirty Years’ War. His textual criticism of the Bible led him to study Old Church Slavonic and, subsequently, the Slavic languages as a group. His erudition ultimately extended to all fields of Slavic literature, language, history, and antiquities.
