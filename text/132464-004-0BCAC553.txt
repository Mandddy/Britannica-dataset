Richard Wilhelm Heinrich Abegg,  (born Jan. 9, 1869, Danzig, Prussia [now Gdansk, Pol.]—died  April 3, 1910, Köslin, Ger.) physical chemist whose work contributed to the understanding of valence (the capacity of an atom to combine with another atom) in light of the newly discovered presence of electrons within the atom.
Abegg became professor of chemistry at the University of Breslau, Ger. (now Wrocław, Pol.), in 1897 and two years later gained the chair of chemistry at the Technical Academy, Breslau. From his study of valence, he concluded that, for the most stable configuration, the number of electrons in the outer group of an atom is eight, which is the number found in the inert gases.
