Micrococcus,  genus of spherical bacteria in the family Micrococcaceae that is widely disseminated in nature. Micrococci are microbiologically characterized as gram-positive cocci, 0.5 to 3.5 μm (micrometres; 1 μm = 10-6 metre) in diameter.
Micrococci are usually not pathogenic. They are normal inhabitants of the human body and may even be essential in keeping the balance among the various microbial flora of the skin. Some species are found in the dust of the air (M. roseus), in soil (M. denitrificans), in marine waters (M. colpogenes), and on the skin or in skin glands or skin-gland secretions of vertebrates (M. flavus). Those species found in milk, such as M. luteus, M. varians, and M. freudenreichii, are sometimes referred to as milk micrococci and can result in spoilage of milk products.
