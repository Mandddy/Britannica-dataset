José Duarte Ramalho Ortigão,  (born Nov. 24, 1836, Porto, Port.—died  Sept. 27, 1915, Lisbon) Portuguese essayist and journalist known for his mastery of Portuguese prose and his critical reflections on his native land.
Ortigão began his career as a teacher of French and as a contributor to the Jornal do Porto (“Porto Journal”) at the age of 19. In 1868 he moved to Lisbon to take up an appointment in the office of the Academia Real das Ciências (Academy of Sciences). In Lisbon he continued writing assiduously for Portuguese journals and established contact with the progressive intellectuals and writers Antero de Quental, Oliveira Martins, Eça de Queirós, and others. Ortigão and his lifelong friend, Queirós, started the satirical review As Farpas (“The Darts”) in 1871, and, after the departure overseas of Queirós late in 1872, Ortigão produced the review alone until 1888. In his hands, As Farpas gradually became less satirical and more didactic and descriptive, a vehicle for disseminating and popularizing such current intellectual doctrines as humanitarianism, positivism, and aesthetic realism.
