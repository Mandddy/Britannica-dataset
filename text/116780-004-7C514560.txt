Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, large desert recreational area in southern California, U.S., lying east of San Diego, south of Palm Springs, and west of the Salton Sea. Encompassing more than 935 square miles (2,420 square km) of the Colorado Desert, it is the largest state park in the 48 contiguous states. Its name is derived from that of the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza (who visited the area in 1774) and the Spanish word borrego—literally “lamb” but also used for the desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni; a subspecies of the Canadian bighorn) that inhabit the region. The park, established in 1933, is headquartered in Borrego Springs.
The park has varied topography that includes dry lake beds, badlands, and mountains that rise above 5,500 feet (1,675 metres). Two-thirds of the park’s area is designated as wilderness, and cactus, yucca, and ocotillo are abundant throughout. Canyons and washes, particularly Coyote Canyon with its year-round stream, provide riparian habitat. Fossils are plentiful in the badlands areas. Among the park’s attractions are groves of California fan palms and a profusion of wildflowers that bloom in mid- to late winter. Deer, kit foxes, iguanas, rattlesnakes, roadrunners, eagles, and the endangered desert bighorn sheep are found in the park.
