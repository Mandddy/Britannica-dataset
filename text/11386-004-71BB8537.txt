Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm,  (born Sept. 26, 1723, Ratisbon—died  Dec. 19, 1807, Gotha, Saxe-Gotha) critic of German descent who played an important part in the spread of 18th-century French culture throughout Europe.
After studying in Leipzig, Grimm attached himself to the powerful Schönberg family. In 1748 he went to Paris as escort to their second son and, later, worked at various times for the Prince of Saxe-Gotha, the Count of Friesen, and the Duc d’Orléans. At the same time he was admitted to progressive literary and philosophical circles in Paris, thanks to his acquaintance with Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
