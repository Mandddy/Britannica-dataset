Rottweiler, breed of working dog descended from a cattle dog left by the Roman legions in Rottweil, Ger. The Rottweiler accompanied local butchers on buying expeditions from the Middle Ages to about 1900, carrying money in a neck pouch to market. It has also served as a guard dog, a droverâ€™s dog, a draft dog, and a police dog.
Characteristically stocky and strongly built, the Rottweiler stands approximately 22 to 27 inches (56 to 68.5 cm) and weighs between 90 and 110 pounds (41 and 50 kg). It has a short, coarse, black coat, with tan markings on its head, chest, and legs.
