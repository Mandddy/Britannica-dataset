Chengdu, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’eng-tu,  city and capital of Sichuan sheng (province), China. Chengdu, in central Sichuan, is situated on the fertile Chengdu Plain, the site of Dujiangyan, one of China’s most ancient and successful irrigation systems, watered by the Min River. The system and nearby Mount Qingcheng, an early centre of Daoism, were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000. The irrigation system, first set up during the Qin dynasty (221–207 bce), diverted half the waters of the Min River eastward to irrigate the plain through a dense network of channels. This system has survived basically in its original form and enables the area to support what has been claimed to be one of the densest agrarian populations anywhere in the world. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 2,663,971; (2005 est.) urban agglom., 4,065,000.
The city is said to have been founded by the Qin before they achieved control of all China during the 3rd century bce. Under their imperial regime the county of Chengdu was established; the name dates from that period. First under the Qin and then under the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce), it was the seat of the commandery of Shu, and in 221 it became capital of the independent dynasty of Shu. Under the Tang dynasty (618–907) it was known as Yizhou, one of the empire’s greatest commercial cities. In the late 8th century it became a secondary capital. After 907 it again became capital of two short-lived independent regimes—the Qian (Former) and Hou (Later) Shu (respectively, 907–925 and 934–965). During that time it was immensely prosperous, and its merchants introduced the use of paper money, which rapidly spread throughout China under the Song dynasty (960–1279).
