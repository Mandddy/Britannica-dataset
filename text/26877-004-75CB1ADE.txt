Norbert Wiener,  (born Nov. 26, 1894, Columbia, Mo., U.S.—died March 18, 1964, Stockholm, Swed.) American mathematician who established the science of cybernetics. He attained international renown by formulating some of the most important contributions to mathematics in the 20th century.
Wiener, a child prodigy whose education was controlled by his father, a professor of Slavonic languages and literature at Harvard University, graduated in mathematics from Tufts College (now Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts) in 1909 at the age of 14. He spent a year at Harvard as a graduate student in zoology but left after he found that he was inept at laboratory work. At his father’s suggestion, he began to study philosophy, and he completed a Ph.D. at Harvard in 1913 with a dissertation on mathematical logic.
