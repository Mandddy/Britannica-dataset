Storm petrel,  any member of about 20 species of seabirds constituting the family Hydrobatidae, or sometimes considered as Oceanitidae (order Procellariiformes). Ranging in length from about 13 to 25 centimetres (5 1/2 to 10 inches), all are dark gray or brown, sometimes lighter below, and often with a white rump. The wings are shorter than those of most other procellariiforms and are rounded at the tips; the bill is of medium length; the nostril tubes (common to all members of the order) are united on the upper surface of the bill; the toes are webbed, except for the hind toe, which is small and elevated; the tail is medium to long and square, forked, or wedge shaped.
Storm petrels fall into two behavioral and structural groups. Most of the species breeding in the southern oceans are shorter winged, square tailed, long legged, and short toed. With wings spread, they patter over the water, “walking,” and pick up minute marine organisms. An example is Wilson’s petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), which breeds on islets along the Antarctic continent and near the Antarctic Circle and winters in the North Atlantic from about June to September.
