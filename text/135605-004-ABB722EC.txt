Boies Penrose,  (born Nov. 1, 1860, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.â€”died  Dec. 31, 1921, Washington, D.C.) American legislator and longtime party boss of Pennsylvania. He served as U.S. senator from Pennsylvania from 1897 to 1921.
Penrose was a member of a socially prominent Philadelphia family. He graduated from Harvard University in 1881 and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1883. Penrose began to practice law in Philadelphia and soon became interested in government and politics. He was elected as a Republican to the state legislature in 1884 and to the state senate in 1887. In that year he also published The City Government of Philadelphia, a study prepared in collaboration with law partner Edward P. Allinson, which advocated certain municipal reforms. The politics of reform did not long hold his interest, however, as he became associated with state party boss Matthew S. Quay. In 1895 Penrose ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for mayor of Philadelphia. Two years later he was elected to the U.S. Senate and was successively reelected until his death.
