Bruce Lee, Chinese name Li Jun Fan  (born November 27, 1940, San Francisco, California, U.S.â€”died July 20, 1973, Hong Kong) American-born film actor who was renowned for his martial arts prowess and who helped popularize martial arts movies in the 1970s.
Lee was born in San Francisco, but he grew up in Hong Kong. He was introduced to the entertainment industry at an early age, as his father was an opera singer and part-time actor. The younger Lee began appearing in films as a child and was frequently cast as a juvenile delinquent or street urchin. As a teenager, he took up with local gangs and began learning kung fu to better defend himself. At that time he also started dance lessons, which further refined his footwork and balance; in 1958 Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship.
