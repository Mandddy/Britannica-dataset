Kate Grenville,  (born Oct. 14, 1950, Sydney, Austl.) Australian novelist whose works of historical fiction examined class, race, and gender in colonial and contemporary Australia.
After earning a bachelor’s degree in literature (1972) from the University of Sydney, Grenville began working as a film editor, writer, and script consultant. In the late 1970s she held various jobs in London and Paris and then went to the United States, where she received a master’s degree in creative writing (1982) from the University of Colorado. Two years later she published her first book, Bearded Ladies, a collection of short stories that explored gender, power, and Australian national identity, all of which would remain central to Grenville’s later work. Lilian’s Story (1984), her first published novel, and Dreamhouse (1986) both examined women struggling against oppressive situations: Lilian Singer is a woman abused by her father, and Louise Dufrey is a wife facing a disintegrating marriage. Joan Makes History (1988) considers the subject of Australian history and identity through the story of Joan, born in 1901, the year of Australia’s federation. As Joan moves through her life, she imagines a multiplicity of other Joans present at different moments in Australia’s history, a device that allowed Grenville to sift the intersections of personal and “official” history.
