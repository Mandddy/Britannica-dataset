Belle da Costa Greene, original name in full Belle Marion Greener  (born December 13, 1883, Washington, D.C., U.S.—died May 10, 1950, New York, New York) American librarian and bibliographer, the moving force in organizing and expanding the collection of J.P. Morgan as the Morgan Library.
Greene was the daughter of lawyer Richard T. Greener, the first African American to graduate from Harvard and the first librarian of colour at the University of South Carolina, and Genevieve Fleet, both of whom were of mixed-race families. Although Belle had been listed as “Colored” on her birth certificate, she was light-skinned, as were both her parents. With the dissolution of the Greener marriage came the opportunity for a break from the past. Greener’s wife and children all dropped the -r from Greener and any association with the man who had abandoned his family. Together with her mother and siblings, Belle determined to “pass” as white, and they were listed so beginning with the 1905 New York state census. Belle settled on the name Belle da Costa Greene and would explain that “da Costa” reflected her Portuguese ancestry, as did (she implied) her olive complexion. Only her brother, Russell, also adopted “da Costa” as well.
