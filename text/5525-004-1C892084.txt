Amman, Arabic ʿAmmān, biblical Hebrew Rabbath Ammon, ancient Greek Philadelphia ,  capital and largest city of Jordan. It is the residence of the king and the seat of government. The city is built on rolling hills at the eastern boundary of the ʿAjlūn Mountains, on the small, partly perennial Wadi ʿAmmān and its tributaries.
Amman’s focus of settlement throughout history has been the small high triangular plateau (modern Mount Al-Qalʿah) just north of the wadi. Fortified settlements have existed there since remote antiquity; the earliest remains are of the Chalcolithic Age (c. 4000–c. 3000 bce). Later the city became capital of the Ammonites, a Semitic people frequently mentioned in the Bible; the biblical and modern names both trace back to “Ammon.” The “royal city” taken by King David’s general Joab (II Samuel 12:26) was probably the acropolis atop the plateau. King David sent Uriah the Hittite to his death in battle before the walls of the city so that he might marry his wife, Bathsheba (II Samuel 11); the incident is also a part of Muslim folklore. The population of the Ammonite cities was much reduced under King David. David’s son Solomon (flourished 10th century bce) had Ammonite wives in his harem, one of whom became the mother of Rehoboam, Solomon’s successor as king of Judah.
