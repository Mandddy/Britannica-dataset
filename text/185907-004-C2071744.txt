Alfonso Cuarón, in full Alfonso Cuarón Orozco  (born November 28, 1961, Mexico City, Mexico) Mexican director and screenwriter who earned an international reputation for fluid storytelling in a versatile range of genres.
Cuarón studied film at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos (a school within the National Autonomous University of Mexico) but was expelled for having helped create, as part of a class project, a film that was controversially shot in English instead of Spanish. Though Cuarón feared he would never work in the cinematic arts, he eventually found work in Mexican television as a technician. That position led to television directing, which in turn led to directing movies.
