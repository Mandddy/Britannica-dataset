Constantius I, original name Flavius Valerius Constantius, or Flavius Julius Constantius, byname Chlorus   (born c. 250, Dacia Ripensis—died July 25, 306, Eboracum, Britain [now York, North Yorkshire, England]) Roman emperor and father of Constantine I the Great. As a member of a four-man ruling body (tetrarchy) created by the emperor Diocletian, Constantius held the title caesar from 293 to 305 and caesar augustus in 305–306.
Of Illyrian descent, Constantius had a distinguished military career before serving as governor of Dalmatia (in modern Croatia). In 289 he left his concubine, Helena, mother of Constantine, and married Theodora, the stepdaughter of the emperor Maximian; with Theodora he had three children, Dalmatius, Constantius, and Constantia. On March 1, 293, Constantius was adopted by Maximian and made his caesar. The two men, together with Diocletian and his caesar, Galerius, formed the tetrarchy.
