Papaloapan River, Spanish Río Papaloapan,  river in Veracruz state, southeastern Mexico. It is formed by the junction of several rivers in Oaxaca state near the Veracruz–Oaxaca border and meanders generally northeastward for 76 miles (122 km) to Alvarado Lagoon, just south of Alvarado. Its chief headstreams include the Santo Domingo, Tonto, and Valle Nacional, which rise in the Sierra Madre Oriental, and the Hondo, Jiquila, and Salado, which drain the Sierra Madre del Sur. Since 1947 the Papaloapan River basin has been developed by the government. Swampy lowlands have been drained and reclaimed, and dams for flood control and hydroelectric power have been built. The project’s success has led to similar schemes in other parts of the gulf lowlands. The Papaloapan system is navigable for 150 miles (240 km) upstream from Alvarado Lagoon.
