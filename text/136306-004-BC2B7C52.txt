Astrodome, the world’s first domed air-conditioned indoor stadium, built in Houston, Texas, in 1965 and arguably the city’s most important architectural structure.
Conceived by Roy Mark Hofheinz (a former county judge and mayor of Houston, 1953–55) and designed by architects Hermon Lloyd and W.B. Morgan, in collaboration with the local firm Wilson, Morris, Crain and Anderson, the Astrodome is a prime example of late Modernist architecture, and its space-age appearance is aptly suited to the city that—with the opening of NASA’s Manned Spacecraft Center (now the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center) in 1961 as the command post for U.S. spaceflights—had ushered in the age of space exploration in the United States. Hofheinz pitched a domed air-conditioned arena to increase attendance to the hot and humid city’s sporting events. He also helped the Houston Colt .45s, later renamed the Astros to associate them with their new stadium, join Major League Baseball. The Astrodome became the home of the Astros when it opened in 1965 and for the National Football League’s Oilers (now the Tennessee Titans) in 1968.
