Gorée Island, French Île de Gorée,  small island just south of Cape Verde Peninsula, Senegal, that was the site of one of the earliest European settlements in Western Africa and long served as an outpost for slave and other trading. It is a rather barren volcanic rock of only 88 acres (36 hectares) that commands the roadstead of Dakar harbour. The small, picturesque town of Gorée is nearly coextensive with the island.
Gorée Island was first visited (1444) by Portuguese sailors under Dinís Dias and occupied in subsequent years. The island’s indigenous Lebu people were later displaced, and fortifications were erected. The town was active in the Atlantic slave trade from 1536 until 1848, when slavery was abolished in Senegal. Historians debate whether Gorée was a major entrepôt for the trade or simply one of many centres from which Africans were taken to the Americas.
