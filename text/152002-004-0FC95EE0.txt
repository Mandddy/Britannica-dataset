Ussuri River, Chinese (Pinyin) Wusuli Jiang or (Wade-Giles romanization) Wu-su-li Chiang,  northward-flowing tributary of the Amur River that for a considerable distance forms the boundary between China (Heilongjiang province) and Russia (Siberia).
The Ussuri is formed by the confluence of the Sungacha (Songâ€™acha) River, the outlet of Lake Khanka (Xingkai); and the Ulakhe and Arsenyevka rivers, both of which rise on the southwestern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin mountain complex. Its length from the source of the Ulakhe is 565 miles (909 km), and its basin is 72,200 square miles (187,000 square km) in area. The Ussuri is navigable from its confluence with the Great (Bolshaya) Ussurka. It joins the Amur River near Khabarovsk.
