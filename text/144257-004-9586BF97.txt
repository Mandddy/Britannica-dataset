Zoe, also spelled Zoë   (born c. 978, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died  1050, Constantinople) Byzantine empress, by marriage from 1028 and in her own right from 1042.
The daughter of the emperor Constantine VIII, Zoe was married to the heir presumptive, Romanus III Argyrus, in 1028 and became empress consort upon his elevation to the throne the same year. She became self-assertive and jealous, exiling her sister Theodora to a monastery; and, neglected by her husband, became enamoured of Michael, her young Paphlagonian chamberlain. In 1034 the emperor became ill, allegedly poisoned by Zoe; and, upon his death on April 11, she at once took control and married Michael, who was proclaimed Emperor Michael IV. Michael IV died in 1041 and was succeeded by Michael V Calaphates.
