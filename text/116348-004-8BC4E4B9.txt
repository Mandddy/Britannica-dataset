William Maxwell Evarts,  (born Feb. 6, 1818, Boston—died  Feb. 28, 1901, New York City) U.S. lawyer and statesman who took part successfully in the three greatest public cases of his generation. He served as counsel for Pres. Andrew Johnson in the impeachment trial before the U.S. Senate (1868), represented the United States in the “Alabama” arbitration at Geneva (1872), and was chief counsel for the Republican Party in the disputed Hayes–Tilden presidential election (1876).
Educated at Yale and Harvard, Evarts quickly rose to the top of the legal profession and, at the same time, became increasingly active in politics, first as a Whig and then as a Republican. He served as attorney general under President Johnson (July 1868–March 1869), as secretary of state under Pres. Rutherford B. Hayes (1877–81), and as U.S. senator from New York (1885–89).
