Isabel Sanford,  (born August 29, 1917, New York, New York, U.S.—died July 9, 2004, Los Angeles, California) American actress best known for her role as Louise (“Weezy”) Jefferson in the long-running television situation comedy The Jeffersons (1975–85).
Sanford made her acting debut in the American Negro Theater’s 1946 production of On Strivers Row, and her first movie role was as Tillie in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967). She caught the eye of television producer Norman Lear, who in 1971 cast her in the recurring role of Louise Jefferson in the groundbreaking series All in the Family (1971–79), which addressed the often taboo subjects of race and social class. She continued in the role in the spin-off series The Jeffersons, for which she won the Emmy Award for best performance by an actress in a comedy series in 1981; she was the first black actress to win the award.
