Stanley Kunitz, in full Stanley Jasspon Kunitz  (born July 29, 1905, Worcester, Mass., U.S.—died May 14, 2006, New York, N.Y.) American Pulitzer Prize-winning poet noted for his subtle craftsmanship and his treatment of complex themes.
Kunitz attended Harvard University, where he earned a B.A. degree in 1926 and an M.A. in 1927. While working as an editor, he contributed poems to magazines, eventually compiling them in his first book, Intellectual Things (1930). He served for two years in the army during World War II, after which he began working as a professor and visiting lecturer at several universities. His collection Passport to the War (1944), like his first book, contains meticulously crafted, intellectual verse. Most of the poems from these first two works were reprinted with some 30 new poems in Selected Poems 1928–1958 (1958), which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1959.
