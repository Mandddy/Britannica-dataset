Legume, also called pod,  fruit of plants of the order Fabales, consisting of the single family Leguminosae, or Fabaceae (peas, beans, vetch, and so on). The dry fruit releases its seeds by splitting open along two seams. Legumes furnish food for humans and animals and provide edible oils, fibres, and raw material for plastics. Nutritionally, they are high in protein and contain many of the essential amino acids. For important members of the legume family, see alfalfa; bean; broom; clover; cowpea; pea; peanut; soybean; vetch.
