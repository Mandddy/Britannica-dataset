Flying fish, any of about 40 species of oceanic fishes of the family Exocoetidae (order Atheriniformes), found worldwide in warm waters and noted for their ability to fly. They are all small, attaining a maximum length of about 45 cm (18 inches), and have winglike, rigid fins and an unevenly forked tail. Some species, such as the widely distributed Exocoetus volitans, are two-winged, with only the pectoral fins enlarged; others, such as the California flying fish (Cheilopogon), are four-winged, with both the pectoral and pelvic (posterior) fins enlarged.
A flying fish does not fly, in the sense of flapping its wing-sized fins, but actually glides. The fish builds up speed underwater, swimming toward the surface with its fins folded tightly against its streamlined body. Upon breaking the surface, the fish spreads its enlarged fins and gains additional thrust from rapid beats of the still-submerged tail. When sufficient speed has been attained, the tail is lifted clear of the water and the fish is airborne, gliding a few feet above the surface at a speed of about 16 km/hr (10 miles per hour). The fish can make several consecutive glides, the tail propelling it up again each time it sinks back to the surface. The stronger fliers can span as much as 180 metres (600 feet) in a single glide, and compound glides, timed as long as 43 seconds, may cover 400 metres (1,300 feet).
