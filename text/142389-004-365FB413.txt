Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers, who are the heroes of the Indian epic the Mahabharata. Arjuna, son of the god Indra, is famous for his archery (he can shoot with either hand) and for the magical weapons that he wins from the god Shiva. His hesitation before the decisive battle against a branch of his family became the occasion for his friend and charioteer, the incarnate god Krishna, to deliver a discourse on dharma, or the right course of human action. Those verses are collectively known as the Bhagavadgita.
