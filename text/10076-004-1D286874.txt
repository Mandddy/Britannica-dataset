Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), small North American rattlesnake of the family Viperidae, found in prairies, swamps, and woodlands from the Great Lakes to Arizona. It is typically 45 to 75 cm (18 to 30 inches) long.
The massasauga may be totally black but is more commonly gray or tan with rows of black or brown spots on its back and sides. It is a venomous snake, usually secretive and unaggressive, that can deliver a painful but rarely fatal bite. The massasauga and the pygmy rattlesnake (S. miliarius) of eastern North America primarily consume frogs, lizards, and rodents. Both are live-bearers.
