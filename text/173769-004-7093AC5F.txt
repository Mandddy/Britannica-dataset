Robert Noyce, in full Robert Norton Noyce  (born December 12, 1927, Burlington, Iowa, U.S.â€”died June 3, 1990, Austin, Texas) American engineer and coinventor of the integrated circuit, a system of interconnected transistors on a single silicon microchip.
In 1939 the Noyce family moved to Grinnell, Iowa, where the father had accepted a position as a Congregational minister and where the son began to demonstrate the traits of an inventor and tinkerer. Noyce majored in physics at Grinnell College (B.A., 1949) and earned a doctorate in solid state physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT; Ph.D., 1953), for a dissertation related to the technology he found most fascinating, the transistor.
