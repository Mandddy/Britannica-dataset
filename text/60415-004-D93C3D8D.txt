Bharata natyam, (
        Sanskrit: “Bharata’s dancing”) the principal of the main classical dance styles of India, the others being kuchipudi, kathak, kathakali, manipuri, and odissi. It is indigenous to the Tamil Nadu region and prevalent in southern India. Bharata natyam serves the expression of Hindu religious themes and devotions, and its techniques and terminology have been traced back to ancient treatises such as the Natya-shastra, by the Brahman sage and priest Bharata. Bharata natyam was originally performed exclusively by female temple dancers and was not brought to the stage for public performance until about 1930.
A program of bharata natyam usually lasts two hours without interruption and includes a specific list of procedures, all performed by one dancer, who does not leave the stage or change costume. The accompanying orchestra—composed of drums, drone, and singer—occupies the back of the stage, led by the guru, or teacher, of the dancer.
