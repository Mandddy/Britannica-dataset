António Feliciano de Castilho,  (born Jan. 28, 1800, Lisbon—died  June 18, 1875, Lisbon) poet and translator, a central figure in the Portuguese Romantic movement.
Although blind from childhood, he became a classical scholar and at the age of 16 published a series of poems, translations, and pedagogical works. Castilho’s literary life may be divided into two phases, the midpoint occurring during the revolutionary period of the late 1840s. During the first he published a series of poems in which he tried to assimilate current Romantic trends while continuing to be guided by a basically Neoclassical spirit.
