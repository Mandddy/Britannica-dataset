Hal Roach, original name Harry Eugene Roach   (born January 14, 1892, Elmira, New York, U.S.—died  November 2, 1992, Bel Air, California) American motion-picture producer, director, and writer best known for his production of comedies of the 1920s and ’30s featuring Harold Lloyd, Will Rogers, Snub Pollard, and Charley Chase, and for the enduringly popular films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and those of the youngsters of the Our Gang comedy series. He ranks with Mack Sennett as a creator of inspired chaos in the early Hollywood comic style.
After a number of miscellaneous jobs, including gold prospector and mule skinner, Roach began his film career in 1912 as a bit player in westerns. In 1914 he formed a company to produce the comedies of Harold Lloyd, achieving his first success with Just Nuts (1915). Five years later he established the Hal Roach Studios at Culver City, California. From that studio, he went on to produce other Lloyd films, including his famous Safety Last! (1923). In all Roach produced some 2,000 comedy shorts and a large number of full-length features during the 1920s, including the Will Rogers series (beginning in 1923) that often satirized the moviemaking industry; the Our Gang comedies; the two-reel ethnic comedies of Max Davidson; the Dippity-Doo-Dads, featuring an all-animal cast; and adventures featuring Rex the Wonder Horse. Roach’s insistence on carefully constructed scripts with solid story lines and well-worked characterizations resulted in a humour based on character and situation rather than on a string of sight gags; because of this emphasis, his comedies have withstood the test of time better than the rather one-dimensional slapstick efforts of Sennett. The most successful Roach comedies were those starring the team of Laurel and Hardy, whose classic films for Roach include Liberty (1928), Big Business (1929), Helpmates (1931), Sons of the Desert (1933), and Way Out West (1937).
