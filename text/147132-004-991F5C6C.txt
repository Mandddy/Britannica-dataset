Pontius Pilate, Latin Pontius Pilatus  (died c. 36 ce) Roman prefect (governor) of Judaea (26â€“36 ce) under the emperor Tiberius who presided at the trial of Jesus and gave the order for his crucifixion.
According to the traditional account of his life, Pilate was a Roman equestrian (knight) of the Samnite clan of the Pontii (hence his name Pontius). He was appointed prefect of Judaea through the intervention of Sejanus, a favourite of the Roman emperor Tiberius. (That his title was prefect is confirmed by an inscription from Caesarea.)
