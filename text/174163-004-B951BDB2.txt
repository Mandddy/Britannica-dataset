Nicholas V, original name Tommaso Parentucelli   (born November 15, 1397, Sarzana, Republic of Genoa [Italy]—died March 24, 1455, Rome) influential Renaissance pope (reigned 1447–55) and founder of the Vatican Library. Soon after his election, he brought to an end the schism caused by rivalries between popes and councils. By 1455 he had restored peace to the Papal States and to Italy. He began a program for the rebuilding of many of Rome’s architectural wonders, including St. Peter’s Church, and became the patron of many artists and scholars. His failure to promote real religious reform, however, helped to bring about the Reformation of the 16th century.
Parentucelli was born in 1397. His father died when he was nine. Later he studied at Bologna but, for lack of funds, had to interrupt his studies there. Then, to earn money, he acted as tutor for two years in two wealthy, cultured Florentine families, and this contact with the early Renaissance coloured all his life. After returning to the university and completing his studies, at the age of 22 he entered the household of Niccolò Albergati, the cardinal archbishop of Bologna, whom he served devotedly for 20 years, accompanying him on his many diplomatic missions throughout Europe.
