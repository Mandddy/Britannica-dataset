Snow line,  the lower topographic limit of permanent snow cover. The snow line is an irregular line located along the ground surface where the accumulation of snowfall equals ablation (melting and evaporation). This line varies greatly in altitude and depends on several influences. On windward slopes and those facing the afternoon sun, the snow line may be as much as a kilometre (more than half a mile) higher than on opposite slopes. Over larger areas, summer temperatures and the amount of snowfall determine the position of the snow line. Where temperatures are low, as near the poles, the snow line is quite low in elevation; where temperatures are high, as near the Equator, the snow line is very high. Average altitudes of the snow line taken over large areas can be used to derive a climatic snow line, which rises or falls in altitude in response to worldwide climatic change. During glacial periods, the climatic snow line was from 600 to 1,200 m (2,000 to 4,000 feet) lower than at present.
