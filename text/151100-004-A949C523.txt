LinkedIn, business-oriented social networking Web site founded in 2002 and headquartered in Mountain View, California.
Unlike other social networks such as Facebook and Myspace, which are often purely recreational, LinkedIn emphasizes a user’s professional connections. Users create profile pages that have a structure similar to a résumé, in that users can summarize their career, advertise their particular skills, and list their education and employment history. Connections are formed between users when one accepts an invitation from another to join his or her network. LinkedIn allows users to further their careers by searching for jobs, finding connections (even at third hand) at a particular company, and receiving recommendations from other users. Membership is free; however, with payment for premium service, users can receive more profiles in their search results and see full profiles of any LinkedIn user.
