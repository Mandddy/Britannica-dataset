Max Scheler,  (born August 22, 1874, Munich, Germany—died May 19, 1928, Frankfurt am Main) German social and ethical philosopher. Although remembered for his phenomenological approach, he was strongly opposed to the philosophical method of the founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl (1859–1938).
Scheler studied philosophy at the University of Jena under Rudolf Eucken (1846–1926), receiving a doctoral degree in 1897. After completing a habilitation thesis for promotion to associate professor (1899), he lectured at Jena until 1906, when he moved to the predominantly Roman Catholic University of Munich. In 1910, after he was accused of adultery in a Munich newspaper, Scheler sued for libel but lost, and the university canceled his teaching contract. He moved to Göttingen, where he lectured in coffeehouses and other venues. His dramatic style attracted many students, including some of those who had attended Husserl’s own lectures at the University of Göttingen. This aroused Husserl’s anger, though he continued to support Scheler’s career. In 1919 Scheler became professor of philosophy and sociology at the University of Cologne. He accepted a professorship at the University of Frankfurt in 1928 but died before he could take up the post. Although he was recognized in the 1920s as Europe’s leading philosopher, his reputation was short-lived, in part because his work was suppressed by the Nazis after 1933.
