Meissner effect, the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of a material that is in the process of becoming a superconductor, that is, losing its resistance to the flow of electrical currents when cooled below a certain temperature, called the transition temperature, usually close to absolute zero. The Meissner effect, a property of all superconductors, was discovered by the German physicists W. Meissner and R. Ochsenfeld in 1933.
As a superconductor in a magnetic field is cooled to the temperature at which it abruptly loses electrical resistance, all or part of the magnetic field within the material is expelled. Relatively weak magnetic fields are entirely repulsed from the interior of all superconductors except for a surface layer about one-millionth of an inch thick. The external magnetic field may be made so strong, however, that it prevents a transition to the superconducting state, and the Meissner effect does not occur.
