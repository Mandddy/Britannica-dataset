Founded in 1798 as the Jefferson Seminary, the University of Louisville is one of the oldest urban universities in the United States. The present university was formed in 1846 with the merger of the Louisville Medical Institute (1837) and the Louisville Collegiate Institute (1838). Initially, the medical school was the major program in the university, and until the late 19th century the College of Arts and Sciences floundered. The university was desegregated in 1950–51, and school sponsorship passed from the municipality to the state in 1970.
