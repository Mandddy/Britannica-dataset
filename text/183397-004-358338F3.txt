Sierra Nevada National Park, national park occupying 1,067 square miles (2,764 square km) in the Cordillera de Mérida of the Andes Mountains in Mérida and Barinas estados (states), northwestern Venezuela. It was established in 1952.
The highest point in Venezuela, Bolívar Peak (also known as La Columna; 16,332 feet [4,978 metres]), is located in the park. Other peaks, notably Humboldt and Bonpland, also rise above 16,000 feet (4,900 metres). Their lower slopes are heavily forested, while glacier lakes and alpine vegetation are found above the timberline. The park’s wildlife includes deer, bear, and many birds. A four-stage cable car, said to be the highest in the world, carries tourists from Mérida to Espejo (“Mirror”) Peak, which rises to about 15,600 feet (4,750 metres). Skiing and mountain climbing are among the other recreational activities.
