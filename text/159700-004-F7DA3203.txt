Artie Shaw, byname of Arthur Jacob Arshawsky   (born May 23, 1910, New York, New York, U.S.—died December 30, 2004, Newbury Park, California) American clarinetist and popular bandleader of the 1930s and ’40s. He was one of the few outstanding jazz musicians whose commitment to jazz was uncertain.
Shaw began playing in high school and turned professional in 1925. The first signs of indecision became apparent in the early 1930s, when he retired from music for a year. In 1935, at a New York swing concert, he played one of his own compositions accompanied by a string quartet. A jazz and dance band with a string section followed, but in 1937 he re-formed his band along more conventional lines and a year later became internationally known through his recording of Cole Porter’s “Begin the Beguine.” A string of hits followed, and Shaw’s popularity came to rival that of clarinetist Benny Goodman, the “King of Swing.” By this time Shaw had become known for his mercurial behaviour and perfectionism. He was harshly critical of himself and of the music business.
