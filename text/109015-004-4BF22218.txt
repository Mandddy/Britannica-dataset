Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,  (born September 15, 1977, Enugu, Nigeria) Nigerian author whose work drew extensively on the Biafran war in Nigeria during the late 1960s.
Early in life Adichie, the fifth of six children, moved with her parents to Nsukka, Nigeria. A voracious reader from a young age, she found Things Fall Apart by novelist and fellow Igbo Chinua Achebe transformative. After studying medicine for a time in Nsukka, in 1997 she left for the United States, where she studied communication and political science at Eastern Connecticut State University (B.A., 2001). Splitting her time between Nigeria and the United States, she received a masterâ€™s degree in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University and studied African history at Yale University.
