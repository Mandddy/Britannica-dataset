Barry Manilow, original name Barry Alan Pincus  (born June 17, 1943, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.) American pop singer and songwriter who specialized in elaborately orchestrated romantic ballads, which first won him a wide audience in the 1970s.
Barry Pincus grew up in a lower-class neighbourhood in Brooklyn. When he was two years old, his father left the family, and several years later Barry assumed his motherâ€™s maiden name, Manilow. In his youth he took up the accordion and the piano, becoming an accomplished musician, and through his stepfather he acquired a taste for jazz and Broadway show tunes. After briefly studying advertising at City College of the City University of New York, Manilow took classes at the New York College of Music (now part of New York University) and later at Juilliard School of Music.
