Costa-Gavras, byname of Konstantin Gavras   (born February 12, 1933, Loutra-Iraias, Greece) Greek-born naturalized French motion-picture director noted for films that have been both political arguments and entertainments (usually as mysteries or thrillers).
The son of a Russian-born father and a Greek mother, Costa-Gavras left Athens in 1952 to go to Paris, where he enrolled in the Sorbonne. After taking a degree in literature with the intention of becoming a writer, he followed another long-held ambition—to make films—and entered the Institute of Higher Cinematographic Studies (Institut des Haut Études Cinématographiques). He became an assistant to such filmmakers as Yves Allégret, René Clair, René Clément, and Jacques Demy.
