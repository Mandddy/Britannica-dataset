Beira, former principality and historical province, north-central Portugal, extending from the banks of the Douro River in the north to the upper course of the Tagus in the southeast and from the Spanish frontier in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. The region was reconquered from the Moors in the 8th century, but Moorish attacks continued until the 15th century. It was also contested during the Portuguese-Castilian wars. In 1835 Beira was divided into the districts of Aveiro, Coimbra, Viseu, Guarda, and Castelo Branco. In 1936 three new provinces were created from it: Beira Litoral (the coast, with Coimbra as its capital), Beira Alta (with Viseu its capital), and Beira Baixa (with Castelo Branco predominant), known as the Beiras. Despite further administrative reorganization, the defining character of each of these three provinces has remained strong. From the west, which includes Aveiro and its lagoon, the university city of Coimbra, and the city of Figueira da Foz at the mouth of the Mondego River, the land rises to a series of rugged hills and mountain ranges up to Torre (Alto da Torre), mainland Portugalâ€™s highest point. To the east, close to the border with Spain, are well-preserved fortifications including Almeida and Sabugal. The rugged, stony region contains numerous sites of historical, cultural, and natural interest. Two notable local doctors, Fernando Namora and Miguel Torga, as well as Aquilino Ribeiro, a regional writer, depicted rustic life in Beira.
