Kinetic sculpture,  sculpture in which movement (as of a motor-driven part or a changing electronic image) is a basic element. In the 20th century the use of actual movement, kineticism, became an important aspect of sculpture. Naum Gabo, Marcel Duchamp, László Moholy-Nagy, and Alexander Calder were pioneers of modern kinetic sculpture.
The numerous varieties of the genre include sculptures whose components are moved by air currents, as in the well-known mobiles of Calder; by water; by magnetism, the specialty of Nicholus Takis; by electromechanical devices; or by the participation of the spectator himself. The neo-Dada satiric quality of the kinetic sculpture created during the 1960s is exemplified by the works of Jean Tinguely. His self-destructing “Homage to New York” perfected the concept of a sculpture being both an object and an event, or “happening.”
