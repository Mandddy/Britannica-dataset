Field trial,  any of the competitions among individual sporting dogs, under conditions that approximate or simulate those found in the hunting field. Competing dogs need not necessarily be of the same breed. In the United States many of the field trials in the bird-dog (pointing dog) category are staged under the sanction of the American Kennel Club, the official governing body of dog shows. The majority, however, are held under the sponsorship of the Amateur Field Trial Clubs of America. In Great Britain field trials are sponsored by the Kennel Club. In both countries, winners in various stakes staged by the member clubs are eligible for regional and national amateur championship stakes. Various stakes are held, including puppy (for dogs not more than 18 months old), derby (not more than 30 months), all-age, shooting dog, and championship events. Novice and limited stakes are sometimes added to the program. Many events are confined to amateur handlers only.
Dogs in bird-dog trials are judged on speed, range, hunting intelligence, handling response, game finding, game and gun manners, style, and intensity. Game birds involved in the U.S. are quail, pheasant, prairie chicken, grouse, and woodcock; those in Great Britain are grouse, partridge, and pheasant.
