Hyposmocoma, moth genus containing more than 350 described species in the family Cosmopterigidae (order Lepidoptera). The group is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and contains multiple species noted for their amphibious caterpillar stage, during which they can survive underwater for unlimited periods of time.
Hyposmocoma are typically small, with a total wingspan of less than 1 cm (0.4 inch). Wing shape is elongated, and the body and wings are of variable colour. Some species have a distinct margin of brush (bristlelike hairs) along the length of the hind wings. Larvae spin silk cases of different shapes that are utilized for shelter. The cases typically contain fragments of materials such as wood, shells, and algae, which enables the caterpillars to blend in with the surrounding environment.
