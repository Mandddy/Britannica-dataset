Charles James Mathews,  (born Dec. 26, 1803, Liverpool, Eng.—died June 24, 1878, Manchester) English writer of comic sketches and one of the best high comedians ever to appear on the English stage.
Mathews was the son of the celebrated entertainer Charles Mathews and his wife, the actress Anne Jackson. Although he possessed much of his parents’ theatrical talents and enjoyed dabbling in amateur productions, Mathews evidently had no early desire for a stage career. He studied architecture under Augustus Pugin, travelled in France and Italy, and worked as an architect for a Welsh coal company before entering the London office of architect John Nash.
