Marcel Déat,  (born March 7, 1894, Guèrigny, Fr.—died  Jan. 5, 1955, Turin, Italy) French politician who was a leading collaborator with Nazi Germany.
A brilliant student, Deat graduated from the École Normale and taught philosophy in Reims. In 1926 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a Socialist but broke with the party in 1932 in opposition to Léon Blum’s leadership. During the 1930s, Déat steadily moved to the political right. Adopting the slogan “Order, Authority, and Nation,” he helped form the Parti Socialiste de France (July 1933) as an alternative to Blum’s Socialist policies. After a brief term as air minister (1936) he lost his seat in the Chamber.
