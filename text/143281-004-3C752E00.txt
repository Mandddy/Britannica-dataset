Mousse,  savoury or sweet dish with the consistency of a dense foam, composed of a pur√©ed chief ingredient mixed with stiffly beaten egg whites, whipped cream, or both. Mousses are almost always cold dishes, sweet mousses sometimes being served frozen. Savoury mousses are frequently prepared from poultry, foie gras, fish, or shellfish, to be eaten as a first course or light entree. They may be stabilized by the addition of gelatin.
Chocolate and mocha mousses are sometimes made with a custard base. For a fruit mousse, pureed fruit or juice replaces the milk in the custard. The term mousse is also used for gelatin desserts that are whipped to a froth after they have partially set.
