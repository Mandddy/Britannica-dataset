Greed, American silent film drama, released in 1924, that was director Erich von Stroheim’s big-budget masterpiece. Hours were cut from the film and are presumed lost forever.
Greed is an adaptation of Frank Norris’s novel McTeague (1899). Trina (played by Zasu Pitts) is a simple woman who wins a $5,000 lottery and then finds herself caught in a love triangle characterized by greed and jealousy with her husband, McTeague (Gibson Gowland), and her former lover, Marcus (Jean Hersholt). The plot is an old standard: money not only cannot buy happiness but also can bring misery. However, the final image of a murder gone wrong in the sands of Death Valley, California, resonates with ironic consequences.
