Saw,  tool for cutting solid materials to prescribed lengths or shapes. Most saws take the form of a thin metal strip with teeth on one edge or a thin metal disk with teeth on the periphery. Usually the teeth are “set” (bent) to alternate sides so that the kerf (groove) cut by the saw is wider than the thickness of the saw. This prevents binding between the cut surfaces and the sides of the saw. The thin-strip saws are used in a variety of arrangements for both hand and machine operation, while circular, or disk, saws are invariably machine powered.
The hand hacksaw has a U-shaped frame and blades 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) long, 1.25 cm (0.5 inch) wide, and 0.06 cm (0.025 inch) thick that close the U and are placed under tension by a screw adjustment in the handle. This saw is one of the most common tools in a machine shop and is used for cutting off solid parts held in a vise. Saws of this type are also used by butchers for cutting bones. For cutting curves and other irregular shapes in wood or other materials, the coping, or jeweler’s, saw, which is basically a hacksaw with a deeper U-shaped frame and a much narrower blade, is well-suited.
