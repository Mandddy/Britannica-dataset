Lukas Foss, original name Lukas Fuchs   (born Aug. 15, 1922, Berlin, Ger.â€”died Feb. 1, 2009, New York, N.Y., U.S.) German-born U.S. composer, pianist, and conductor, widely recognized for his experiments with improvisation and aleatory music.
He studied in Berlin and Paris and, after moving to the United States in 1937, with the composers Randall Thompson and Paul Hindemith and the conductors Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. Foss published his first work at age 15, and in 1945 he became the youngest composer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1957, while a professor of composition and the orchestra director at the University of California at Los Angeles, he founded the Improvisation Chamber Ensemble, which was the vehicle of many of his experiments in music generally described as aleatory (chance) and stochastic (based on a system of mathematical probability).
