American University of Beirut, private, nondenominational, coeducational international and intercultural university in Beirut, Lebanon, chartered in 1863 by the state of New York, U.S., as the Syrian Protestant College. Classes started in 1866. Although founded by the American Protestant Mission to Lebanon, the school was set up as an autonomous organization and has no official relationship with any religious body. Its present name was adopted in 1920. The educational philosophy is similar to that of an American university, but its program is adapted to the educational needs of the Middle East; some 80 percent of its students come from the Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa. A school of medicine was opened in 1867, a school of pharmacy in 1871, and a school of nursing and a hospital in 1905. All are important to the country, and the hospital was the main medical centre of Beirut in the early years of the Lebanese Civil War (1975â€“90). The university managed to remain in operation during the war, but most of the non-Arab members of its faculty had fled Lebanon by the late 1980s.
