Al Green, byname of Albert Greene  (born April 13, 1946, Forrest City, Arkansas, U.S.) American singer-songwriter who was the most popular performer of soul music in the 1970s. By further transforming the essential relationship in soul music between the sacred and the secular, Green followed the musical and spiritual path of his greatest inspiration, Sam Cooke. At the height of Green’s commercial success, however, he sacrificed his fame in order to fully dedicate himself to his religious faith.
In 1964, after his family moved from Arkansas to Michigan, Green and some friends formed the Creations and toured the chitlin circuit (venues that catered to African American audiences) in the South before renaming themselves Al Green and the Soul Mates three years later. They formed their own record label, releasing the single “Back Up Train,” which enjoyed moderate success on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1968. The watershed moment for Green came in Texas in 1968 when he met Willie Mitchell, a former bandleader who served as chief producer and vice president of Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. Obscurity was threatening to end Green’s fledgling career, but with Mitchell’s help he became a star in short order. After releasing a cover version of the Beatles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand” in 1969, which exhibited his awe-inspiring vocal agility, Green recorded a fine remake of the Temptations’ “I Can’t Get Next to You,” and it reached number one on the soul charts in 1971. But it was “Tired of Being Alone” (1971), written by Green, that suggested his extraordinary potential. It sold more than a million copies, preparing the way for “Let’s Stay Together,” the title track from Green’s first gold album.
