Coreid bug (family Coreidae), also called leaf-footed bug or squash bug,  any of 2,000 widely distributed species of bugs (order Heteroptera), many of which are important plant pests. Coreid bugs are large, usually more than 10 mm (0.4 inch) in length. They occur in a wide range of environments and vary in size, shape, and colour. Their wings usually lie in a depression on the back. Some feed only on plants, others on insects, and some on both.
One of the best-known coreid bugs in North America is the squash bug (Anasa tristis), an important pest of squash, melon, and pumpkin. It is about 15 mm (0.6 inch) long; and, although its basic colour is dull tan, it is covered with so many dark pits that it appears to be brown or black. Squash bugs spend the winter in the adult stage, living in debris or some other sheltered spot. In the spring they deposit conspicuous egg masses on the leaves of young squash plants. There are several generations each season.
