Jean Giraudoux, in full Hyppolyte-Jean Giraudoux  (born October 29, 1882, Bellac, France—died January 31, 1944, Paris) French novelist, essayist, and playwright who created an impressionistic form of drama by emphasizing dialogue and style rather than realism.
Giraudoux was educated at the École Normale Superiéure and made the diplomatic service his career. He became known as an avant-garde writer with a group of early poetic novels, such as Suzanne et le Pacifique (1921). Although those works were generally considered difficult, farfetched, and precious, other works soon appeared. In Siegfried et le Limousin (1922), Giraudoux depicts in silhouette, as it were, the hostility between two enemies, France and Germany, as a background to his story of a man who suffers from amnesia. Bella (1926) is a love story behind which can be glimpsed the rivalry between two statesmen, a nationalist and an internationalist. Thus, what was to become the central theme of Giraudoux’s plays was made clear: a pair of opposites, whatever they might be—man and God in Amphitryon 38 (1929), man and woman in Sodome et Gomorrhe (1943), or the world of paganism and the world of the Old Testament in Judith (1931).
