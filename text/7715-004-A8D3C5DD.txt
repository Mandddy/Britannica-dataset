Tristimulus system, a system for visually matching a colour under standardized conditions against the three primary colours—red, green, and blue; the three results are expressed as X, Y, and Z, respectively, and are called tristimulus values.
For example, the tristimulus values of the emerald-green pigment are X = 22.7, Y = 39.1, and Z = 31.0. These values specify not only colour but also visually perceived reflectance, since they are calculated in such a way that the Y value equals a sample’s reflectivity (39.1 percent in this example) when visually compared with a standard white surface by a standard (average) viewer under average daylight. The tristimulus values can also be used to determine the visually perceived dominant spectral wavelength (which is related to the hue) of a given sample; the dominant wavelength of the emerald-green pigment is 511.9 nm (1 nanometre = 10−9 metre).
