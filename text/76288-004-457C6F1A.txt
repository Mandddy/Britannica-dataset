Francis Thomas Bacon, byname Tom Bacon   (born Dec. 21, 1904, Billericay, Essex, Eng.—died May 24, 1992, Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire) British engineer who developed the first practical hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells, which convert air and fuel directly into electricity through electrochemical processes.
Bacon was a graduate of Eton College and of Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1925; M.A., 1946), and became intrigued with fuel cells while working for the electrical company C.A. Parsons &amp; Co. Ltd. in Newcastle upon Tyne (1925–40). Although Sir William Grove had discovered the principle of fuel cells in 1842, they were considered a scientific curiosity until the early 1940s, when Bacon, then working at King’s College, Cambridge, proposed their use in submarines. He continued his research with the Anti-Submarine Experimental Establishment and then returned to Cambridge (1946), where he demonstrated a successful six-kilowatt fuel cell (1959).
