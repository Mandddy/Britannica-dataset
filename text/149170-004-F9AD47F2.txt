Whithorn, royal burgh (town) in Dumfries and Galloway region, historic county of Wigtownshire, southwestern Scotland. It lies on the peninsula between Luce and Wigtown bays. One of the oldest Christian centres in Britain, it was founded about ad 397 by St. Ninian, who built a small whitewashed stone church—hence Whithorn, or “White House,” from the Anglo-Saxon Huitaern—on the site of which a monastery was built about 1130. St. Ninian’s shrine was a popular place of pilgrimage until the Protestant Reformation. Robert I (the Bruce) visited it in 1329, James IV was a regular visitor, and Mary, Queen of Scots, made the last royal pilgrimage there, in 1567. Pop. (2001) 867.
