Grand Palais, (
        French: “Great Palace”) exhibition hall and museum complex built between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine River in Paris for the 1900 Exposition Universelle. A masterpiece of Classicism and Art Nouveau, this Beaux Arts structure (built 1897–1900), with its large stone colonnades and enormous conservatory-style glass roof, is a major tourist attraction and a Parisian landmark.
A competition was held in 1894 for the general layout of the Exposition Universelle, for which some 100 projects were considered. The first-prize winner was Eugène Hénard, for whose project the Palace of Industry (constructed for an international exposition in 1855) was to be demolished to make way for a grand exhibition hall (the Grand Palais), a smaller exhibition building (the Petit Palais), and a bridge (Pont Alexandre III). A new street (present-day Avenue Winston-Churchill) connecting the Champs-Élysées to the bridge also was subsequently built. In 1896 a second competition was held for the actual design of the Grand Palais, and this time the award was granted jointly to the four top architects. Henri Deglane, Albert Louvet, and Albert Thomas were each assigned a different portion of the building to design, while the whole project was overseen by Charles Girault. The intention was to link the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais, and the Pont Alexandre III to the Champs-Élysées and to the Hôtel des Invalides across the Seine.
