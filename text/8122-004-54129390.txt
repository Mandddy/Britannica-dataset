Irish wolfhound, tallest of all dog breeds, a keen-sighted hound used in Ireland for many years to hunt wolves and other game. An ancient breed, first mentioned about the 2nd century ad, it is similar in build to the greyhound but far more powerful. The female, which is smaller than the male, stands a minimum of 30 inches (76 cm) and weighs a minimum of 105 pounds (48 kg); the male wolfhound is at least 32 inches (81 cm) tall and weighs a minimum of 120 pounds (54 kg), though it may greatly exceed this size. The coat is rough and is long on the brows and underjaw; colours include gray, brindle, red-brown, black, and white. Noted for speed, strength, and hunting ability, the Irish wolfhound is also valued as a gentle, even-tempered companion.
