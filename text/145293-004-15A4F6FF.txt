Anja Pärson,  (born April 25, 1981, Umeå, Sweden) Swedish skier who in 2007 became the first person to win world championship races in each of the five disciplines of Alpine ski racing.
Pärson was coached by her father at the same ski club in tiny Tärnaby, Sweden, that had produced Ingemar Stenmark, who during his career (1973–89) won more races than any other skier in history. Pärson idolized Stenmark and from a young age was compared to him, as well as to Pernilla Wiberg, whose nine Olympic and world championship medals in the 1990s had made her Sweden’s most successful woman skier. By 2007, however, Pärson had surpassed Wiberg by amassing a combined 16 medals in the Olympics and the world championships.
