American arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis), also called eastern arborvitae, or northern white cedar,  ornamental and timber evergreen conifer of the cypress family (Cupressaceae), native to eastern North America. In the lumber trade it is called, among other names, white cedar, eastern white cedar, and New Brunswick cedar.
Often 20 m (65 feet) tall, the tree is the most common and probably the hardiest of the arborvitae. Its trunk is sometimes forked near the ground into several main stems covered with reddish brown bark. The cones have 8 to 10 scales, of which only four are usually fertile. Most cultivated varieties are narrow, densely pyramidal shrubs, and many have interesting variations in foliage colour. See also arborvitae.
