Pembrokeshire, also called Pembroke, Welsh Sir Benfro,  county of southwestern Wales, bounded on the northeast by Ceredigion, on the east by Carmarthenshire, on the south by the Bristol Channel, and on the west and northwest by St. Bride’s Bay and Cardigan Bay of St. George’s Channel. The county’s rugged and convoluted coastline forms a peninsula with several protruding headlands, including St. David’s Head, the most westerly point in Wales, whose cliffs stand 594 feet (181 metres) above St. George’s Channel. In the south a rim of low rolling hills encloses a plain draining into the Milford Haven estuary. Uplands in the north reach an elevation of 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. The present county of Pembrokeshire is coterminous with the historic county of the same name. The county’s administrative centre is Haverfordwest.
Pembrokeshire was an important centre of Bronze and Iron Age culture. Northwestern Pembrokeshire (including the southern slopes of the Preseli Hills) is especially rich in megalithic remains—dolmens, alignments, standing stones, and stone circles. A prehistoric earthwork known as Warrior’s Dyke still stands amid the high cliffs of St. David’s Head. Tombs, cairns, and hut circles provide evidence of Iron Age settlement in the south.
