Tyrant flycatcher, also called New World flycatcher,  any of about 400 species of aggressive insect-eating New World birds of the family Tyrannidae (order Passeriformes). About one-third of the species are not flycatcher-like in habit and bear names derived from their habitats (e.g., bush tyrant, marsh tyrant) or from their similarity to the songbird groups (tit-tyrant, shrike-tyrant). A few are named for their bill shape (spade bill, flat bill, bent bill). Many have common names not suggestive of their appearance (e.g., phoebe, pewee, kingbird).
Tyrant flycatchers range in size from 7.5 to 40.5 cm (3 to 16 inches) long, some species having greatly elongated tail feathers. Most tyrannids are plain coloured, in shades of gray, brown, or olive above and tan, white, or yellow below; a few are strikingly patterned in black and white. Many have a patch of red or yellow on the crown (often concealed, but erectile, nevertheless). In all but a few, the sexes are marked alike. A notable exception is species Pyrocephalus rubinus, found from the southwestern United States to Argentina, the male of which is fiery red with dark wings and back.
