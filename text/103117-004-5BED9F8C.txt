Karl Rove, in full Karl Christian Rove  (born Dec. 25, 1950, Denver, Colo., U.S.) American political consultant and principal architect of U.S. Pres. George W. Bush’s two presidential election campaigns (2000, 2004).
Rove was political even as a young child. He pasted campaign stickers for Richard M. Nixon on his bicycle in 1960, and while in high school he volunteered for Wallace Bennett’s senatorial campaign. Though he attended the University of Utah and other colleges, he did not receive a degree, and in 1971 he went to Washington, D.C., to become executive director of the College Republicans. Two years later he successfully ran for the post of chairman in a campaign managed by strategist Lee Atwater, an early mentor. During the 1970s Rove was involved with various Republican organizations and candidates, including George H.W. Bush. Becoming involved in Texas politics, Rove worked on the unsuccessful congressional campaign of George W. Bush in 1978 and, in the same year, on the successful gubernatorial campaign of Bill Clements, the first Republican to be elected to the state’s highest office since Reconstruction (1865–77). Rove formed his own consulting business in 1981, with a list of clients that included Phil Gramm, elected to the U.S. Senate in 1984, and Tom Phillips, who in 1988 became the first Republican ever elected to the Texas Supreme Court.
