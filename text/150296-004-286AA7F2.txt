AMA Plaza, formerly (1972–2013) IBM Building and One IBM Plaza, byname of 330 North Wabash,  a 52-story skyscraper in downtown Chicago, Illinois, U.S., designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and completed in 1972. It is a towering example of both the International Style and the elegant pin-striped steel-and-glass buildings Mies crafted in the postwar era. Rising on a narrow site along the Chicago River, the prominent black slab is located between two other Chicago landmarks, the 1967 Marina City and the glittery massiveness of the Trump Tower (completed 2009).
Mies, the final director of the famed Bauhaus school of design, fled Nazi Germany in 1937 and moved to Chicago, where he directed the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (later the Illinois Institute of Technology) for 20 years. His residential high-rises at 860–880 North Lake Shore Drive brought to prominence the black steel-and-glass aesthetic featured in what was then known as the IBM Building, and he designed numerous corporate and government high-rises in this style, including the Federal Center in Chicago’s Loop and the Seagram Building on Park Avenue in New York. The IBM Building was Mies’s swan song; he completed the drawings only weeks before his death in August 1969. The building was renamed in 2013 when the American Medical Association moved its headquarters there.
