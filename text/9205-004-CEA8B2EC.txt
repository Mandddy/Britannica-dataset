Sucker (family Catostomidae), any of the freshwater fishes constituting the family Catostomidae, similar to and closely related to the carp and minnows (Cyprinidae). There are about 80 to 100 species of suckers. Except for a few species in Asia, all are North American. Many suckers are almost indistinguishable from minnows, but catostomids may often be recognized by the sucking, usually ventral mouth with protrusible lips.
Suckers live on the bottom of lakes and slow streams and feed by sucking up invertebrates and plants. They are generally rather sluggish fishes. The species vary considerably in size. The lake chubsucker (Erimyzon sucetta), for example, is a small species up to 25 cm (10 inches) long, and the bigmouth buffalo fish (Ictiobus cyprinellus), a large sucker, measures up to 90 cm in length and 33 kg (73 pounds) in weight. Suckers are bony but are fished commercially and to some extent for sport. The various genera are known by such names as hog sucker (Hypentelium), buffalo fish (Ictiobus), carpsucker (Carpiodes), and redhorse, or jumprock (Moxostoma).
