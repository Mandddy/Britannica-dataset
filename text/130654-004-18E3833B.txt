Hank Greenberg, byname of Henry Benjamin Greenberg, also called Hammerin’ Hank  (born Jan. 1, 1911, Bronx, N.Y., U.S.—died Sept. 4, 1986, Beverly Hills, Calif.) American professional baseball player who won two American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (1935, 1940) and became the sport’s first Jewish superstar.
After a standout high school baseball career, Greenberg was offered a contract by his hometown New York Yankees. He was put off by the prospect of having to oust the team’s then first baseman, superstar Lou Gehrig, so he declined the offer and studied for a year at New York University before signing with the Detroit Tigers in 1929. The lanky 6-foot 4-inch (1.93-metre) Greenberg appeared in just one game for the Tigers in 1930 before being sent to the minors for seasoning. He played his first full major league season in 1933, and he quickly established himself as one of baseball’s premier power hitters.
