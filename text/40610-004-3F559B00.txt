William George Ward,  (born March 21, 1812, London, Eng.—died  July 6, 1882, London) English author and theologian, one of the leaders of the Oxford movement, which sought to revive in Anglicanism the High Church ideals of the later 17th-century church. He eventually became a convert to Roman Catholicism.
Ward was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and became a fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, in 1834. He was ordained in the Anglican church in 1840. Under the influence of John Henry Newman, later cardinal, he joined the Oxford movement, in which his role was that of an extremist pressing for submission to the Roman Catholic authority. Protestants strongly opposed his argument that the Thirty-nine Articles—the doctrinal formularies of the Church of England—were incompatible with the Catholic status of the Church of England. He was suspended from Balliol for supporting Newman in a series of pamphlets. After publishing The Ideal of a Christian Church (1844), which urged the Church of England to “sue humbly” at Rome’s feet “for pardon and restoration,” his work was condemned by the University of Oxford.
