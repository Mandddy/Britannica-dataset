Georg Simon Ohm,  (born March 16, 1789, Erlangen, Bavaria [Germany]—died July 6, 1854, Munich) German physicist who discovered the law, named after him, which states that the current flow through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference (voltage) and inversely proportional to the resistance.
Ohm became professor of mathematics at the Jesuits’ College at Cologne in 1817. The most important aspect of Ohm’s law is summarized in his pamphlet Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet (1827; The Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically). While his work greatly influenced the theory and applications of current electricity, it was so coldly received that Ohm resigned his post at Cologne. He accepted a position at the Polytechnic School of Nürnberg in 1833. Finally his work began to be recognized; in 1841 he was awarded the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London and was made a foreign member a year later. The ohm, the physical unit measuring electrical resistance, also was named for him.
