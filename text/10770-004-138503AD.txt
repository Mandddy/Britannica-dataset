Arbīl, also spelled Irbīl or Erbil, Assyrian Arba-ilu, Greek Arbela,  ancient town, northern Iraq. It is situated 48 miles (77 km) east of Mosul in the foothills of the mountains that rise to the east. It is a trade centre for agricultural produce. A rail terminus, it is also linked by roads to Turkey, Syria, and Iran.
Arbīl is one of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world. The modern town occupies the top of the tell (mound formed by successive building over a long period of time), rising about 100 feet (30 metres) above the level of the plain. The town was mentioned in the late 3rd-millennium-bce correspondence of Shulgi, king of Ur, as Urbillum, and later it was known as Arba-ilu by the Assyrians. It was a centre of communication in the Assyrian empire and long remained a crossroads of caravan routes. In the Battle of Gaugamela, also known as the Battle of Arbela, fought near the town in 331 bce, Alexander the Great decisively defeated Darius III, opening the way for his conquest of Persia. The town became Christian at an early date, and later (340 ce) Christians were persecuted there. The Muslim conquest in the 7th century did not prevent Arbīl from remaining an active centre of Christianity and the seat of a bishopric. Muẓaffar al-Dīn, brother-in-law of Saladin, made Arbīl his capital from 1190 until 1232 and constructed several buildings that can still be seen at the foot of the upper town. Arbīl lost its major importance to Mosul in the 13th century but remained a leading town in the region.
