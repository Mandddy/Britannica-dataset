Honda Ishirō,  (born May 7, 1911, Asahi (now part of Tsuruoka), Yamagata prefecture, Japan—died February 28, 1993, Tokyo) Japanese filmmaker who worked closely with Kurosawa Akira but was perhaps best known for his leading role in Japan’s kaijū eiga (“monster movie”) craze of the 1950s and ’60s, mostly through his direction of Gojira (1954; Godzilla) and several of its sequels.
Honda grew up in a small village, the youngest of five children born to a Buddhist priest and his wife. When Honda was a child, the family moved to the Tokyo area, where he encountered motion pictures for the first time. He later attended Nihon University (1931–33) as one of its first film majors, and before graduating, he was recruited to join Photo Chemical Laboratory, a film-production facility that in 1936 was subsumed into the Tōhō Motion Picture Company. Until the early 1950s Honda worked as an assistant director for the studio on more than a dozen films, including many directed by Yamamoto Kajirō. After Honda enlisted in an army infantry regiment in 1935, however, his nascent film career was periodically interrupted by military duties, including assignments in China and Manchuria during the second Sino-Japanese War. While stationed near Wuhan, China, in 1945, he was taken captive as a prisoner of war for about six months.
