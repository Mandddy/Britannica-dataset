Francis Ford Coppola,  (born April 7, 1939, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.) American motion-picture director, writer, and producer whose films range from sweeping epics to small-scale character studies. As the director of films such as The Godfather (1972), The Conversation (1974), and Apocalypse Now (1979), he enjoyed his greatest success and influence in the 1970s, when he attempted to create an alternative to the Hollywood system of film production and distribution.
Coppola’s father, Carmine, a frustrated composer who played flute in several orchestras, including Arturo Toscanini’s NBC Symphony orchestra, settled his family in the New York City area. Coppola grew up in and around Queens and in Great Neck, on Long Island. Confined to bed with polio at age nine, he devised puppet shows for his own entertainment and soon began making 8-mm films. After earning a B.A. in drama from Hofstra University, he pursued a Master of Fine Arts degree at the University of California at Los Angeles, studying filmmaking. During that period Coppola began working for noted low-budget exploitation-film producer-director Roger Corman, for whose American International Pictures he performed second-unit photography and direction, among other tasks. One of Coppola’s first projects was writing dialogue to be dubbed into his reedited versions of a pair of Russian-made films that became The Magic Voyage of Sinbad and Battle Beyond the Sun (both 1963). While on location in Ireland, Coppola persuaded Corman to put up $20,000 to bankroll his first directorial effort, Dementia 13 (1963), a gory horror film based on a script that Coppola had hastily written.
