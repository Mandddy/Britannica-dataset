Pierre-Simon Ballanche,  (born August 4, 1776, Lyon, France—died June 12, 1847, Paris) religious and social philosopher who influenced the Romantic writers and played an important part in the development of French thought in the early decades of the 19th century. The Romantics were attracted by his rejection of 18th-century rationalism and by the poetic and oracular style in which he expressed his religious and social theories.
Basically a Roman Catholic, Ballanche read widely among the mystical authors of the past and of his own time. In Du sentiment considéré dans ses rapports avec la littérature et les arts (1801; “Sentiment Considered in Its Relationship to Literature and the Arts”), he expressed views on the role of religious emotion in art that foreshadow François-Auguste-René Chateaubriand’s influential landmark of Romanticism, Le Génie du christianisme (1802; “The Genius of Christianity”). In the post-French Revolutionary era he reconsidered the basis and functions of human society in the light of his religious opinions.
