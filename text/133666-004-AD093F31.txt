Jacob Wackernagel,  (born Dec. 11, 1853, Basel, Switz.—died  May 22, 1938, Basel) Swiss historical and comparative linguist, author of a monumental study of Sanskrit. He is also known as the discoverer of Wackernagel’s law, an important statement of word order in Indo-European languages.
Influenced by his father, Wilhelm Wackernagel (1806–69), a professor of Germanic studies at the University of Basel, he became interested in comparative linguistics and Sanskrit while studying at the University of Göttingen under Theodor Benfey. In 1876 Wackernagel became Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer) in classical languages at the University of Basel, and in 1881 he became professor of Greek language and literature, succeeding Friedrich Nietzsche. After having made a number of significant contributions to the historical and comparative study of Greek, he began his comprehensive work, Altindische Grammatik (1896–1905, 1930; “Old Indic Grammar”).
