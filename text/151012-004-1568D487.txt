Tolna, megye (county), south-central Hungary. It lies in the southern part of Transdanubia and borders the counties of Fejér to the north, Bács-Kiskun to the east, Baranya to the south, and Somogy to the west. Szekszárd has been the county seat since 1779. Other important towns include Bonyhád, Tolna, Paks, Simontornya, Dombóvár, and Tamási.
The landscape is flat in the eastern territories occupied by the Mezoföld (a loess tableland) and the riverine lowlands that meet the Danube River on the county’s eastern border. It rises gently in the west, in the Kapos-Koppány hills and the Tolna highlands, and in the southern outliers of the Mecsek Mountains. Its rivers—the Kapos, Koppány, Sárvíz, Lajvér, and Donáét—flow into the Danube via the Sió River.
