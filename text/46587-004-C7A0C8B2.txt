Sławomir Mrożek,  (born June 29, 1930, Borzęcin, Poland—died August 15, 2013, Nice, France) Polish playwright and satirist noted for his subtle parody and stylized language.
Mrożek entered journalism as a cartoonist and an author of short humorous articles filled with wordplay and grotesque situations. During the 1950s and ’60s he became a prominent figure in Polish literature, and the sheer absurdity of his plays helped him evade the rigours of communist censorship. He left Poland in 1963 and went eventually to Paris, becoming a French citizen in 1978. After living in Mexico from 1989 to 1996, Mrożek returned to Poland for several years, but in 2008 he reestablished his residency in France.
