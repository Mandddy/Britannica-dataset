Jean-Baptiste, Count Jourdan,  (born April 29, 1762, Limoges, Fr.—died  Nov. 23, 1833, Paris) military commander remembered as the sponsor of conscription during the French Revolutionary regime and as one of Napoleon’s marshals of the empire.
After being a soldier in King Louis XVI’s army and serving in the West Indies (1778–84), Jourdan retired and became a draper in Limoges. He supported the Revolution, however; and, having been elected lieutenant colonel of volunteers in 1791, he rose to general of a division (1793). After successes against the Austrians, he was made commander of the Army of the Moselle in March 1794. Executing Lazare Carnot’s new strategy of concentrating troops and artillery at points of attack, he marched westward to the Sambre River and, on June 26, won so decisive a victory at Fleurus, in Hainaut, that Austrian resistance west of the Meuse River collapsed. By October, his army was occupying all of Belgium.
