Hind,  any of certain species of fishes in the sea bass family, Serranidae (order Perciformes). All species referred to as hinds are in the genus Epinephelus, which also includes many groupers. They are found in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico along the North American coast, with the exception of the red hind (E. guttatus), which ranges from the Carolinas to Brazil. The rock hind (E. adscensionis), ranging from New England to the West Indies, may reach 61 cm (24 inches); the speckled hind (E. drummondhayi) of the coastal region of the southeastern United States is somewhat smaller, reaching a length of 46 cm (19 inches).
All hinds are considered edible and are sought after by sports fishermen. Although they do not run in schools, they may congregate because of habitat preference.
