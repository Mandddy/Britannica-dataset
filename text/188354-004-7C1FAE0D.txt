Bert Lahr, original name Irving Lahrheim  (born August 13, 1895, New York, New York, U.S.—died December 4, 1967, New York City) American stage and screen actor best known for his dynamic portrayal of the Cowardly Lion in the film The Wizard of Oz (1939).
Lahr was a lackadaisical student who left school after failing eighth grade. In 1910 he joined a friend’s burlesque act, and he honed his energetic and instinctive approach to comedy while working his way up the bill on the burlesque and vaudeville circuits. Lahr made his debut in legitimate Broadway theatre in Harry Delmar’s Revels (1927), but it was Hold Everything (1928), a show tailored specifically to the comedian, that turned him into a star. Other stage shows followed, including Flying High (1930), Hot-Cha! (1932), Life Begins at 8:40 (1934), and The Show Is On (1936).
