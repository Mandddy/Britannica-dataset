Brake,  device for decreasing the speed of a body or for stopping its motion. Most brakes act on rotating mechanical elements and absorb kinetic energy either mechanically, hydrodynamically, or electrically.
Mechanical brakes are the most common; they dissipate kinetic energy in the form of heat generated by mechanical friction between a rotating metallic drum or disk and a stationary friction element brought into contact with it by mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic means. The friction elements for drum brakes may be bands or shoes (blocks with one concave surface); for disk brakes they are pads or rings. Friction materials may be organic, metallic, or ceramic; molded asbestos is commonly used.
