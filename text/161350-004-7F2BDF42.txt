Lewis Henry Morgan,  (born November 21, 1818, near Aurora, New York, U.S.—died December 17, 1881, Rochester, New York) American ethnologist and a principal founder of scientific anthropology, known especially for establishing the study of kinship systems and for his comprehensive theory of social evolution.
An attorney by profession, Morgan practiced law at Rochester (1844–62) and served in the New York State Assembly (1861–68) and Senate (1868–69). In the early 1840s he developed a deep interest in Native Americans and over his lifetime championed their struggles against colonialism and oppression. While making an exhaustive survey of the history, social organization, and material culture of the Iroquois nation, he was adopted by the Seneca tribe (1846), the focus of his particular interest. Results of his observations appeared in The League of the Ho-dé-no-sau-nee, or Iroquois (1851).
