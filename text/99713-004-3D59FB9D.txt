Chanute glider of 1896, biplane hang glider designed and built by American aviation pioneers Octave Chanute, Augustus M. Herring, and William Avery in Chicago during the early summer of 1896. Along with the standard glider flown by Otto Lilienthal of Germany, the Chanute glider, designed by Chanute but also incorporating the ideas of his young employee Herring with regard to automatic stability, was the most influential of all flying machines built before the Wright brothers began designing aircraft. See also history of flight.
The aircraft was conceived in discussions between Chanute and Herring during tests of other glider designs in the sand dunes ringing the southern shore of Lake Michigan from June 22 to July 4, 1896. Constructed in a Chicago workshop by Avery, another Chanute employee, the aircraft was originally designed as a triplane. The lowest set of wings was removed at the time of initial testing in a successful effort to reduce the amount of lift at the front of the glider. Chanute was responsible for the most important feature of the craft, a rigid structure based on railroad trussing that enabled an engineer to calculate the strength of the glider.
