10 Downing Street, address in London of the official office and residence of the prime minister of the United Kingdom and, by extension, the name of the building itself. It has been associated with the prime minister since that office came into being in the 18th century, and it has served as the prime minister’s home sporadically since 1735 and continuously since 1902. Apart from living quarters and offices, the complex includes state drawing rooms and dining rooms for hosting dignitaries and other guests, as well as a room where the cabinet regularly meets. The building’s exterior is recognizable by its modest black front door and its black brick facade.
The area around 10 Downing Street (now known as the City of Westminster) has been a centre of British government since at least the 11th century, when King Canute I built a royal palace there. In 1682 government official Sir George Downing undertook the construction of a row of houses in Westminster, near Whitehall Palace. Fifty years later King George II offered one of them, then known as 5 Downing Street (renumbered in 1779), as a personal gift to Sir Robert Walpole, the first lord of the Treasury. After employing architect William Kent to join the house with a larger one behind it, Walpole took up occupancy in 1735 on the condition that the building also be made available to future first lords of the Treasury while in office. Beginning with Walpole, nearly all first lords of the Treasury have simultaneously held the title of prime minister (though the title was not made official until 1905), and the building has since become identified with the more familiar post.
