Bouvier des Flandres, (
        French: “cowherd of Flanders”) cattle-driving dog noted for its working ability. The breed originated in southwestern Flanders and the northern hills of France. It served as an ambulance dog and messenger in World War I. In Belgium it must win a prize in police work or as a guard or army dog before it can gain the title of champion. The bouvier des Flandres is characterized by a rugged appearance and compact build. It has a thick, wiry, tousled-looking coat and may be brown, black, gray, mixed gray and white (salt-and-pepper), or brindle. It stands 23.5 to 27.5 inches (60 to 70 cm) and weighs, ideally, about 88 pounds (40 kg).
