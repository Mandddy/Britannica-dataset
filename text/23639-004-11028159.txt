William Barker Cushing,  (born Nov. 4, 1842, Delafield, Wis., U.S.—died  Dec. 17, 1874, Washington, D.C.) U.S. naval officer who won acclaim for his daring exploits for the Union during the American Civil War (1861–65).
Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1857, Cushing was obliged to resign four years later because of his irreverent attitude and practical jokes. The onset of the Civil War gave him a chance to redeem himself, however, and in four years’ time he had risen to the rank of lieutenant commander. Exhibiting courage and exceptional resourcefulness, he also experienced amazing good fortune and escaped a number of hazardous incidents without harm; the more superstitious sailors regarded him as invulnerable.
