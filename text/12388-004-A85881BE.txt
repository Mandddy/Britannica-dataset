Ferenc Deák, byname The Sage Of The Country, Hungarian A Haza Bölcse  (born Oct. 17, 1803, Söjtör, Hung., Austrian Empire [now in Hungary]—died  Jan. 28/29, 1876, Budapest) Hungarian statesman whose negotiations led to the establishment of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867.
Deák was the son of a wealthy Hungarian landowner. After graduating in law, he entered the administrative service of his county of Zala, which in 1833 sent him to represent it in the Hungarian Diet, in place of his brother, who had resigned his mandate. At that Diet and those of 1839 and 1841, Deák made his mark as a leader of the growing reform movement for the political emancipation and internal regeneration of Hungary. Reelected in 1843, he declined his mandate in protest against the scandalous manner in which the election had been conducted, but by this time his unimpeachable integrity, unvarying good sense, and encyclopaedic knowledge of the law had made him the most generally respected figure in his camp. It was he who, in 1847, drafted for the “national opposition” its program of reform for the Diet of 1847. Ill health prevented him from seeking election to that body, but when, in March 1848, the crown sanctioned the establishment of an independent Hungarian ministry, the new minister president, Count Lajos Batthyány, insisted on his taking the portfolio of justice.
