Upon his death in 1888, Thomas Green Clemson donated land and money to establish an agricultural college in South Carolina. The land was Fort Hill, the former estate of Clemsonâ€™s father-in-law, statesman John C. Calhoun. The state established the Clemson Agricultural College the following year, and instruction began in 1893. At the outset the college was a military school and open to men only. In 1955 the school changed its status, becoming a civilian and coeducational institution. It gained university status in 1964.
