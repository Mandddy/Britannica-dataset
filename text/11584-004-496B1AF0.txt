Garter snake (genus Thamnophis), any of more than a dozen species of nonvenomous snakes having a striped pattern suggesting a garter: typically, one or three longitudinal yellow to red stripes, between which are checkered blotches. Forms in which the stripes are obscure or lacking are often called grass snakes. Authorities differ as to the number of species, since garter snakes show only slight differences in their scales but considerable geographic differences in coloration. In many areas from Canada to Central America, they are the most common serpent. Western forms are associated with water more than eastern forms.
Garter snakes are small to moderate in size—usually less than 100 cm (39 inches) long—and quite harmless. If handled they struggle and discharge a foul secretion from the anal gland; some will strike. Among the more defensive species is the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis), probably North America’s most widely distributed reptile. The ribbon snake (T. sauritus), small and slender, is a strongly striped form. Garter snakes live chiefly on insects, earthworms, and amphibians; the ribbon snake is especially fond of frogs. They do not lay eggs but generally breed in early spring and give birth in late summer.
