Shimazaki Tōson, pseudonym of Shimazaki Haruki   (born March 25, 1872, Magome, Nagano prefecture, Japan—died  Aug. 22, 1943, Ōiso, Kanagawa prefecture) Japanese poet and novelist, whose fiction illuminated the clash of old and new values in a Japan feverishly modernizing itself during the period of the Meiji Restoration (1868–1912).
Tōson was educated in Tokyo at Meiji Gakuin, where he was also baptized, although Christianity did not lastingly affect either his life or his thought. In the early 1890s he began to write poetry and joined the short-lived romantic movement of young poets and writers, which he later described in his novel Haru (1908; “Spring”). The first of his major novels, Hakai (1906; The Broken Commandment), the story of a young outcast schoolteacher’s struggle for self-realization, has been called representative of the naturalist school, then the vogue in Japan, although it more clearly reflects the influence of Jean-Jacques Rousseau than of Émile Zola. Ie (1910–11; The Family) depicts the stresses Japan’s modernization brought to his own family. Shinsei (1918–19; “New Life”) narrates the unsavoury affair of a writer with his niece in a manner that carries the confessional principle to embarrassing excesses.
