Georges Bernanos,  (born Feb. 20, 1888, Paris—died  July 5, 1948, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Fr.) novelist and polemical writer whose masterpiece, The Diary of a Country Priest, established him as one of the most original and independent Roman Catholic writers of his time.
Bernanos began life as a Royalist journalist and later worked as an inspector for an insurance company. Like his predecessor, the French Catholic writer Léon Bloy, Bernanos was a visionary for whom the supernatural world was never far away. He was also a man of humour and humanity who abhorred materialism and compromise with evil. His vehement sincerity is seen in his political pamphlets La Grande Peur des bien-pensants, a polemic on the materialism of the middle classes (1931; “The Great Fear of Right-Thinking People”), and Les Grands Cimetières sous la lune (1938; A Diary of My Times, 1938), a fierce attack on Fascist excesses during the Spanish Civil War and on the church dignitaries who supported them.
