Dugout, also called dugout canoe,  any boat made from a hollowed log. Of ancient origin, the dugout is still used in many parts of the world, including Dominica, Venezuela, and Melanesia. Sizes of dugouts vary considerably, depending on the bodies of water they ply. The hull of a dugout used for ocean travel—as it was on both coasts of North America and continues to be elsewhere—could be as long as 100 feet (30 metres). The dugout is streamlined outside for maneuverability and is dug out by burning, chipping, and scraping to make it both strong and buoyant enough for its intended cargo. It formed the basis for more complicated construction by the addition of planking to the sides, such as in the pirogue. See also canoe.
