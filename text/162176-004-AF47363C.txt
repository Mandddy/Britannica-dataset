The trees are dome-shaped and grow to about 11 to 12 metres (35 to 40 feet) tall. The smooth oval leaves vary from 2 to 8 cm (0.75 to 3 inches) long and have smooth margins and smooth surfaces. The small flowers, which grow singly or in clusters directly on the branches and trunk, bear four white petals.
