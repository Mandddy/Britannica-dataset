Yemelyan Pugachov, in full Yemelyan Ivanovich Pugachov, Pugachov also spelled Pugachev  (born c. 1742, Zimoveyskaya-na-Donu, Russia—died January 21 [January 10, Old Style], 1775, Moscow) leader of a major Cossack and peasant rebellion in Russia (Pugachov Rebellion, 1773–75).
An illiterate Don Cossack, Pugachov fought in the Russian army in the final battles of the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), in Russia’s campaign in Poland (1764), and in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74. Following the siege and conquest of Bendery (1769–70), however, he returned home as an invalid. For three years after his recovery, he wandered, particularly among settlements of Old Believers, a dissident religious group that exercised considerable influence over him.
