Henry Sidgwick,  (born May 31, 1838, Skipton, Yorkshire, Eng.â€”died  Aug. 29, 1900, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) English philosopher and author remembered for his forthright ethical theory based on Utilitarianism and his Methods of Ethics (1874), considered by some critics as the most significant ethical work in English in the 19th century.
In 1859 Sidgwick was elected a fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later was made a lecturer in classics, a position he exchanged for one in moral philosophy in 1869. He was appointed praelector in 1875, and in 1883 he became Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy. He was active in promoting higher education for women, primarily through founding Newnham College, Cambridge (1871), of which his wife, Eleanor Balfour, became principal in 1892. A member of the Metaphysical Society, he was also interested in psychical phenomena and was a founder and first president of the Society for Psychical Research in 1882.
