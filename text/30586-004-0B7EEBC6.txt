Jakob Böhme,  (born 1575, Altseidenberg, near Görlitz, Saxony [Germany]—died Nov. 21, 1624, Görlitz) German philosophical mystic who had a profound influence on such later intellectual movements as idealism and Romanticism. Erklärung über das erste Buch Mosis, better known as Mysterium Magnum (1623; The Great Mystery), is his synthesis of Renaissance nature mysticism and biblical doctrine. His Von der Gnadenwahl (On the Election of Grace), written the same year, examines the problem of freedom, made acute at the time by the spread of Calvinism.
Böhme was born at the end of the Protestant Reformation period. After receiving a rudimentary education, he went, in 1594 or 1595, to nearby Görlitz, a town where controversies over Reformation issues seethed. Here crypto-Calvinists (Lutherans charged with maintaining Calvinist views), Anabaptists (radical Protestants), Schwenkfeldians (followers of the Reformer Schwenkfeld), Paracelsian physicians (followers of the occultic physician Paracelsus), and humanists vied with orthodox Lutherans. Martin Möller, the Lutheran pastor of Görlitz, was “awakening” many in the conventicles that he had established.
