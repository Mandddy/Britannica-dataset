Cow parsnip (genus Heracleum), genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the parsley family (Apiaceae), distributed throughout the North Temperate Zone and on tropical mountains. Cow parsnips are perennials, often several feet high, with large compound leaves and broad clusters of white or purplish flowers. Nearly all members of the genus can cause skin irritation and blistering in humans and are sometimes confused with other plants of the parsley family, including water hemlocks (Cicuta), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Sium).
Common cow parsnip (H. lanatum or H. maximum) is a weedy plant native to North America. It grows to more than 2 metres (7 feet) in height and produces white flower clusters that are nearly 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter.
