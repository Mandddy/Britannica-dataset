Pierre-Jean de Smet,  (born January 30, 1801, Termonde [now in Belgium]—died May 23, 1873, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.) Belgian-born Jesuit missionary whose pioneering efforts to Christianize and pacify Indian tribes west of the Mississippi River made him their beloved “Black Robe” and cast him in the role of mediator in the U.S. government’s attempt to secure their lands for settlement by whites.
Arriving in the United States in July 1821, de Smet entered the Jesuit novitiate at White Marsh, Maryland. Two years later he traveled with eight companions to Missouri, where he was ordained priest in 1827. His association with the Roman Catholic St. Louis College (later University) continued throughout his lifetime.
