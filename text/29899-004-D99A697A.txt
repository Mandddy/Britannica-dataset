Jean-Jacques Bernard,  (born July 30, 1888, Enghien-les-Bains, France—died  Sept. 12, 1972, Paris) French playwright and chief representative of what became known as l’école du silence (the “school of silence”) or, as some critics called it, the “art of the unexpressed,” in which the dialogue does not express the characters’ real attitudes. As in Martine(1922), perhaps the best example of his work, emotions are implied in gestures, facial expressions, fragments of speech, and silence.
The son of the dramatist Tristan Bernard, Jean-Jacques began writing plays before World War I. Unconscious jealousy is the theme of Le Feu qui reprend mal (1921; The Sulky Fire) and Le Printemps des autres (1924; The Springtime of Others). In L’Âme en peine (1926; The Unquiet Spirit), two characters who never meet feel an inexplicable disquiet whenever they are near one another. Included among Bernard’s later plays are the more conventional À la recherche des coeurs (1931; “In Search of Hearts”) and Jeanne de Pantin (1933).
