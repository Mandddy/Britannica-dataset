Visby, city and capital of the län (county) of Gotland, southeastern Sweden. It lies on the northwest coast of the island of Gotland, in the Baltic Sea. Because of its remarkably well-preserved medieval ramparts and buildings, Visby, “the city of roses and ruins,” was designated a protected monument in 1810 and a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995.
A Stone Age settlement and port existed (c. 2000 bce) near the future town site. In the Bronze Age, the island’s inhabitants were engaged in trade with other Baltic groups. Gotland later gained importance because of its location along the shipping routes between Russia and western Europe. Foreign traders settled on the island as early as the 9th century ce, and German merchant-colonists subsequently established the town of Visby. By 1161 the town developed into one of the principal northern European mercantile centres, and it soon occupied a leading position within the Hanseatic League, which had previously been dominated by Lübeck (now in Germany). It reached its zenith in the 13th century. Earning the epithet regina maris (“queen of the sea”), it developed its own maritime code and coined its own money. The town began to decline, however, in the face of Lübeck’s rising power, and in 1299 the league removed Visby’s Hanseatic privileges. The town retained a share of Baltic commerce, though without the advantages afforded by league status. The next blow to the town was delivered by the Black Death about 1349–50.
