Rhea, major regular moon of Saturn and the planet’s second largest, after Titan. It was discovered in 1672 by the Italian-born French astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini and named for a Titan of Greek mythology.
Rhea has a diameter of 1,528 km (949 miles) and revolves around Saturn in a prograde, nearly circular orbit at a mean distance of 527,040 km (327,490 miles) and with an orbital period of about 4.52 Earth days. Rhea’s density, which is 1.3 times that of water, indicates that the moon is composed mostly of water ice. In addition, infrared spectral observations show a surface composed mainly of water frost. Rhea has a tenuous atmosphere of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Like most of Saturn’s other major moons, Rhea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping the same hemisphere toward Saturn and the same hemisphere forward in its orbit.
