Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, byname Lion Of Nicaragua, Spanish León De Nicaragua  (born 1871—died  Feb. 26, 1966, Managua, Nicaragua) prominent diplomat and politician, president of Nicaragua (1917–21).
Born to a distinguished Nicaraguan family, Chamorro early became an opponent of the regime of José Santos Zelaya. From 1893 on, Chamorro organized and was active in many of the revolts against this regime. He served as representative in Washington (1913–16 and 1921–23) and signed the Bryan–Chamorro Treaty (1914), which, in part, gave the United States the right in perpetuity to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua in exchange for foreign aid amounting to $3,000,000. In 1926 Chamorro seized the government from President Carlos Solorzano but was forced to resign when neither the United States nor other Central American countries recognized his government. In 1949 Chamorro returned from exile and, having lost the 1950 presidential election to Anastasio Somoza, worked with Somoza on the writing of a new constitution that guaranteed a percentage of government positions to Conservatives. Chamorro also prevented the incumbent president from succeeding himself. Somoza’s threatened repudiation of the pact, as well as his increasingly dictatorial rule, brought about an assassination attempt in 1954. Chamorro was convicted of complicity and temporarily exiled. He was president for life of Nicaragua’s Conservative Party.
