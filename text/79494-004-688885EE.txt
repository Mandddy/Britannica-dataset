Darwinian medicine, field of study that applies the principles of evolutionary biology to problems in medicine and public health. Evolutionary medicine is a nearly synonymous but less-specific designation. Both Darwinian medicine and evolutionary medicine use evolutionary biology to better understand, prevent, and treat human disease. These goals are very different from concerns about the human species pursued under the rubric medical Darwinism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Darwinian medicine, which is named for English naturalist Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary studies, is not a method of practice or a specialized area of research. Like embryology, evolution provides a basic science foundation for all research and clinical practice. Some applications are very practical, such as using evolutionary modeling to understand antibiotic resistance or the reasons why disease-causing genes persist. Other applications are more fundamental. For example, an evolutionary foundation deepens scientistsâ€™ understanding of what disease is, and it explains why the metaphor of the body as a designed machine is inadequate.
