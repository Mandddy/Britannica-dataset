Avebury, archaeological site in Kennet district, administrative and historic county of Wiltshire, England, some 18.5 miles (30 km) north of Stonehenge. It is one of the largest and best-known prehistoric sites in Europe, encompassing 28.5 acres (11.5 hectares) on the River Kennet at the foot of the Marlborough Downs. Avebury was named for the village that occupies part of the site.
The late Neolithic (New Stone Age) structure consists of a circular bank of chalk 1,400 feet (425 metres) in diameter and 20 feet (6 metres) high, faced by chalk blocks quarried from a formerly 30-foot- (9-metre-) deep ditch within. There were four entrances to this outer circle. Within the outer circle stands a ring of 27 sandstone (sarsen) pillarsâ€”less than one-third the original number of pillars. They each weigh up to 50 tons. Inside that ring are the remains of two smaller adjoining stone circles, each originally consisting of about 30 uprights and each approximately 350 feet (105 metres) in diameter. At the centre of the southern inner circle stood a tall obelisk surrounded by smaller boulders. The northern inner circle contained a central U-shaped stone structure. There is evidence of a smaller ring of stones to the northeast. The Ring Stone, still standing in the 18th century but now a mere stump, was a huge perforated stone that stood within the earthworks and main stone circle at the southern entrance. It is possible that the shapes and alignment of the stones, which have an almost geometric precision, had some astronomical significance.
