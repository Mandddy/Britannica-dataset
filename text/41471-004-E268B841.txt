Whitefly, any sap-sucking member of the insect family Aleyrodidae (order Homoptera). The nymphs, resembling scale insects, are flat, oval, and usually covered with a cottony substance; the adults, 2–3 mm (0.08–0.12 inch) long, are covered with a white opaque powder and resemble tiny moths. The four wings develop within the insect and evert during the last molt. These pests are abundant in warm climates and are found on houseplants and in greenhouses.
The citrus whitefly (Dialeurodes citri) is economically important, sucking sap from orange and date trees and producing honeydew, a sweet by-product of digestion, upon which grows a sooty fungus that ruins the fruit. Control is by oil or parathion sprays.
