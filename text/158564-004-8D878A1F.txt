As a youth, Borden helped survey the future city of Covington, Kentucky, where his family settled on their travels westward. He taught school in southern Mississippi and immigrated to Texas in 1829, where he prepared the first topographical map of Texas, helped write the first constitution of that state, was cofounder of the first long-lived Texas newspaper, and laid out the city of Galveston.
