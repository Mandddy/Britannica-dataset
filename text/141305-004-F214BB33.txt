Tench (Tinca tinca), widely distributed Eurasian aquarium and game fish of the carp family Cyprinidae (order Cypriniformes), noted for its ability to survive low oxygen conditions. The tench is a stout, small-scaled fish with a barbel at each corner of its mouth and a thick, slimy skin. It is greenish or blackish and usually 18–35 cm (7–14 inches) long with a weight of about 2 kg (4 1/2 pounds). Most abundant in quiet, mud-bottomed waters thick with plants, it feeds mainly on small animals and plants. Its slime was once thought able to cure injured fishes and was also applied to human wounds. The golden tench is a red-gold variety of the species sometimes kept in ponds.
