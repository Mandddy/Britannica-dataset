Trogon (family Trogonidae), any of about 35 bird species common to warm regions. They constitute the family of Trogonidae in the order Trogoniformes. Trogons have a bright red to yellow belly in contrast to a dark chest and upperparts. In Africa and America males are iridescent above. Those of Asia lack the gloss but have a touch of pink or red on the head, chest, rump, or tail. Among the best-known species of the trogon family are the quetzals (genus Pharomachrus).
Most trogons are 24 to 46 cm (9 1/2 to 18 inches) long, an exception being the resplendent (or Guatemalan) quetzal, also called resplendent trogon (Pharomachrus mocinno), which is about 125 cm (50 inches) long. The graduated tail, of 12 feathers, is carried closed (square-tipped) and typically has a black-and-white pattern on the underside (as in cuckoos). The wings are rounded, legs short, feet weak. Uniquely, the second (inner) toe is fixed rearward. The bill is short, curved, and broad, with bristles at the base; in many species it is serrated. The eye is ringed with colourful bare skin.
