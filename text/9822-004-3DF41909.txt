Oscar Niemeyer, in full Oscar Niemeyer Soares Filho  (born December 15, 1907, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil—died December 5, 2012, Rio de Janeiro) Brazilian architect, an early exponent of modern architecture in Latin America, particularly noted for his work on Brasília, the new capital of Brazil.
Niemeyer studied architecture at the National School of Fine Arts, Rio de Janeiro. Shortly before he graduated in 1934, he entered the office of Lúcio Costa, a leader of the Modernist movement in Brazilian architecture. He worked with Costa from 1937 to 1943 on the design for the Ministry of Education and Health building, considered by many to be Brazil’s first masterpiece of modern architecture. The design reveals the influence of the Swiss-born French architect Le Corbusier, who was a consultant on the construction. Niemeyer also worked with Costa on the plans for the Brazilian Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair of 1939–40.
