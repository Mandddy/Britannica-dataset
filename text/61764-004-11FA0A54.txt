Liv Ullmann, in full Liv Johanne Ullmann  (born December 16, 1939, Tokyo, Japan) Norwegian actress known for her natural beauty and intelligent, complex performances. Her name is closely linked to that of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, with whom she worked in several films.
Ullmann’s father was a Norwegian engineer whose work demanded extensive travel. As a result, Liv was born in Japan and reared and educated in Norway, Canada, and the United States. During her teenage years, she studied acting in London and Norway and performed in several plays for Oslo’s National Theatre. She appeared in small roles in four minor films before meeting Ingmar Bergman in 1966. When Bergman cast Ullmann in the principal role of his complex psychological drama Persona (1966), they began a long-standing professional and personal relationship. Ullmann’s work with Bergman received widespread acclaim and made the actress an international star. Their collaborations—nearly all of which are regarded as masterpieces by film scholars—include Hour of the Wolf (1968), Shame (1968), Cries and Whispers (1972), Scenes from a Marriage (1973), and Autumn Sonata (1978).
