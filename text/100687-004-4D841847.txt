Stork (family Ciconiidae), any of about 20 species of long-necked large birds constituting the family Ciconiidae (order Ciconiiformes), related to the herons, flamingos, and ibises. Storks range from about 60 cm to more than 150 cm (2 to 5 feet) in height. All or part of the head and upper neck may be bare of feathers and brightly coloured. Storks are voiceless or nearly so, for lack of a fully developed syrinx (vocal organ), but some of them clatter their bills loudly when excited. They fly, alternately flapping and soaring, with neck outstretched and legs trailing. Storks occur mainly in Africa, Asia, and Europe. One species, the black-necked stork, also occurs in Australia. Three New World species occur between Florida and Argentina.
Most storks are found in flocks except during the breeding season, when they pair off. They feed during the day. Most eat small animals caught in shallow water and fields. Some, like the marabou stork of Africa and the adjutant stork of India, feed primarily on carrion. The nest, a large twig platform built by both sexes, is constructed in trees, on rock ledges, or, in the case of the white stork, on rooftops and chimneys, often in colonial groupings. Three to six chalky-white eggs are incubated by both parents and hatch in about five weeks.
