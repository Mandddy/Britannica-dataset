Dorothy Gish, in full Dorothy Elizabeth Gish  (born March 11, 1898, Massillon, Ohio, U.S.—died June 4, 1968, Rapallo, Italy) American actress who, like her sister Lillian, was a major figure in silent films, particularly director D.W. Griffith’s classics.
Gish grew up in New York City and made her stage debut at age four. She and Lillian formed close friendships with the actress Mary Pickford (then known as Gladys Mary Smith) during their childhood. Pickford introduced them to Griffith in 1912. Griffith immediately gave them small parts in a series of silent movies, beginning with An Unseen Enemy (1912), and placed them under contract to his studio the next year.
