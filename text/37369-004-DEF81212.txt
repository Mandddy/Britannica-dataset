Johannes Linnankoski, pseudonym of Vihtori Peltonen   (born Oct. 18, 1869, Askola, Russian Finland—died  Aug. 10, 1913, Helsinki) novelist, orator, and champion of Finnish independence from Russia; his works were instrumental in forming Finnish national consciousness in the early 20th century.
Linnankoski was of peasant origin and largely self-taught. His finest novel, Pakolaiset (1908; “The Fugitives”), is about peasant life. More popular in his day was Laulu tulipunaisesta kukasta (1905; The Song of the Blood-Red Flower, 1920), a lyrical fantasy relating the amorous adventures of a young lumberjack. The story was the basis for three successful Finnish films.
