Hugh Caswall Tremenheere Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding,  (born April 24, 1882, Moffat, Dumfriesshire, Scot.—died  Feb. 15, 1970, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Eng.) British air chief marshal and head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain (1940) in World War II; he was largely responsible for defeating the German Air Force in its attempt to gain control of British skies in preparation for a German invasion of England.
A squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps in World War I, Dowding remained in the new Royal Air Force. After serving in command, staff, and training positions in Britain and Asia, he became chief of the newly created Fighter Command in 1936. He vigorously promoted the development of radar and the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters that contributed significantly to the defeat of the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. Although the Fighter Command was outnumbered, Dowding’s strategic and tactical skill enabled it to retain air superiority and thwart Germany’s aims. He retired in November 1942 and was created baron the next year.
