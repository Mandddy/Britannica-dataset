Aimee Kennedy was reared by her mother in the work of the Salvation Army. She preached her own brand of the Christian gospel at age 17 and in 1908 was married to a Pentecostal evangelist, Robert J. Semple. Under her husband’s influence she converted to that belief, and she did missionary work with him in China. After his death in Hong Kong in 1910 she returned to the United States. In 1912, while working with her mother and the Salvation Army in New York City, she married Harold S. McPherson; the marriage later ended when she turned to full-time itinerant evangelism and healing.
