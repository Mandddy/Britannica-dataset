Barn owl, any of several species of nocturnal birds of prey of the genus Tyto (family Tytonidae). Barn owls are sometimes called monkey-faced owls because of their heart-shaped facial disks and absence of ear tufts. They are about 30 to 40 cm (12 to 16 inches) long, white to gray or yellowish to brownish orange. Their eyes are small in comparison with those of other owls and dark-coloured. Barn owls hunt mainly small rodents (such as mice and shrews), often in cultivated land. They nest in hollow trees, buildings, towers, and old hawk nests.
The common barn owl (T. alba) occurs worldwide except in Antarctica and Micronesia. Other species occur only in the Old World. Many inhabit open grasslands. Some are called grass owls (such as the common grass owl, T. capensis, of India, the South Pacific, Australia, and South Africa).
