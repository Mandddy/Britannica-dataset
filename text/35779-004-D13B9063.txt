Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, pseudonym Bogdan Bolesławita   (born July 28, 1812, Warsaw, duchy of Warsaw [now in Poland]—died March 19, 1887, Geneva, Switzerland) Polish novelist, poet, literary critic, dramatist, historian, and journalist who was the dominant prose writer of Poland’s Romantic period.
Kraszewski attended the University of Wilno (now V. Kapsukas State University), was imprisoned in 1830 on a charge of conspiracy against the Russian government, and was released in 1832. From 1834 to 1859 he lived in Volhynia (now in Ukraine), where he wrote, farmed, and did social work. He was also involved in editorial work during this period. From 1841 he edited, and from 1849 to 1852 edited and published, the Ateneum review. Between 1859 and 1862 (by which time he had returned to Warsaw), he edited the daily Gazeta Codzienna (later Gazeta Polska). Forced to leave Warsaw in January 1863 by Count Aleksander Wielopolski (head of the civil government), whom he had offended in an editorial, Kraszewski settled in Dresden, Germany. In 1883 the German government arrested him on a charge of espionage on behalf of France and in 1884 sentenced him to three and one-half years’ imprisonment in the fortress at Magdeburg. Released in 1885, he went to Geneva, where he died a few years later.
