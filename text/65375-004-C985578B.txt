Enterocoelomate, any animal in which the mesoderm-lined body cavity (coelom) arises in the embryonic stage as an outpocketing of the developing gut (enteron). This form of development, found in echinoderms (e.g., starfishes, sea urchins) and a few other invertebrate phyla and in chordates (e.g., fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals), has been viewed as evidence of the common ancestry of echinoderms and chordates. Enterocoelomates are grouped together and are often referred to as deuterostomes.
