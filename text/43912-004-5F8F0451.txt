Cabriolet, originally a two-wheeled, doorless, hooded, one-horse carriage, first used in 18th-century France and often let out for hire. The name is thought to derive from cabriole (French: “caper”) because of the vehicle’s light, bounding motion. Later cabriolets were built with four wheels. When used as hacks, cabriolets often had a jump seat or a side seat for the driver. Later, the word cabriolet, shortened to “cab,” was used for any carriage for hire, as a hackney cab.
