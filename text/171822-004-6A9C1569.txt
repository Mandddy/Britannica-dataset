Christopher Polhem, byname of Christopher Polhammer  (born December 18, 1661, Gotland, Swedenâ€”died August 30/31, 1751, Stockholm?) Swedish mechanical and mining engineer.
From 1693 to 1709 he devised water-powered machinery that mechanized operations at the great Falun copper mine. In 1704 he built a factory in Stjaernsund that used division of labour, hoists, and conveyor belts to minimize manual labour, anticipating mass-production techniques later adopted in America and England. His alphabet of machines demonstrated the basic elements of mechanism used by later machine builders. His rolling mill was later adapted by Henry Cort to the production of wrought iron in England.
