Matrix,  in geology, the material in which something is embedded, either the natural rock that holds crystals, fossils, pebbles, mineral veins, and the like, or the fine-grained materials that surround larger grains in a rockâ€”e.g., silt and clay particles in a sandstone or tiny crystals in a crystalline rock, sometimes called groundmass.
