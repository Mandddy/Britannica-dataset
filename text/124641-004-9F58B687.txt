Caramel,  candy substance obtained by boiling sugar to or beyond approximately 240° F (115° C), at which point its mass takes on a slightly yellowish colour and pleasantly burnt smell.
Caramels vary in consistency between the short, or soft, and the long, or more chewy types depending upon the proportions of ingredients. Corn syrup added to the basic sugar constituent controls graining and contributes body. Milk, essential to the traditional “carmel-candy” flavour, imparts a creamy, collapsible consistency. The blended ingredients, including fats and starches, are stirred continuously during cooking and then poured into vessels or over cooling slabs in preparation for cutting and wrapping.
