Jingxi, (
        Chinese: “opera of the capital”) , Wade-Giles romanization ching-hsi, English conventional Peking opera, also called Beijing opera,  popular Chinese theatrical form that developed in the mid-19th century. It incorporated elements of huidiao from Anhui, dandiao from Hubei, and kunqu, the traditional opera that had predominated since the 16th century. Sung in Mandarin, the dialect of Beijing and of the traditional elite, the jingxi musical verse plays came to be performed throughout China, although most provinces and many major cities also cultivated their own operatic variants using local dialect.
Jingxi is highly conventionalized. The attitudes of individual characters are encoded in traditional steps, postures, and arm movements. The actors and actresses wear elaborate face paint to show the characters they play. Acrobatic movements are frequently used to suggest violent action. Accompaniment is provided by a small orchestra of stringed and wind instruments, wooden clappers, and a small drum. Interludes of spoken narration permit singers to rest periodically during the characteristically lengthy performances. Jingxi traditionally employed an all-male cast with female impersonators, but in the late 20th century, it expanded its scope to admit female actors. The most renowned jingxi performer was Mei Lanfang, who played mostly female roles; during the first half of the 20th century, he introduced the art form to an international audience by touring in Japan, the United States, and the Soviet Union.
