Amy Tan, in full Amy Ruth Tan  (born February 19, 1952, Oakland, California, U.S.) American author of novels about Chinese American women and the immigrant experience.
Tan grew up in California and in Switzerland and studied English and linguistics at San Jose State University (B.A., 1973; M.A., 1974) and the University of California, Berkeley. She was a highly successful freelance business writer in 1987 when she took her Chinese immigrant mother to revisit China. There Tan, for the first time, met two of her half sisters, a journey and a meeting that inspired part of her first novel, The Joy Luck Club (1989; film 1993). The novel relates the experiences of four Chinese mothers, their Chinese American daughters, and the struggles of the two disparate cultures and generations to relate to each other.
