Rhodesian ridgeback, also called African lion hound,  South African hound dog breed characterized by a narrow band of hair that grows forward along its back, against the direction of the rest of the coat. This ridge is inherited from a half-wild native hunting dog that, by breeding with various European dogs, formed the stock that gave rise to the Rhodesian ridgeback. Typically strong, active, and of great endurance, the Rhodesian ridgeback is a trim, shorthaired dog, with hanging ears and a glossy, yellowish brown to reddish brown coat. It stands 24 to 27 inches (61 to 69 cm) and weighs 70 to 85 pounds (32 to 39 kg). A versatile dog, it has distinguished itself as a hunter (especially of lions), as a guard, and as a companion.
