University of California, system of public universities in California, U.S., with campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Merced, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. The university traces its origins to the private College of California, founded in 1855 in Oakland. In 1868 the college merged with the Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College (which had been established as a land-grant school in 1866) to form the University of California; in 1873 the university moved to Berkeley. Over time, other schools became part of the system. A 26-member board of regents governs the system, which has a total enrollment of approximately 200,000.
Berkeley, the main campus of the system, has about 33,000 students. Its 14 schools and colleges include those for optometry, public health, social welfare, public policy, natural resources, journalism, and environmental design and offer some 300 degree programs. A major research institution, it operates the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center, the Energy Institute, the International Computer Science Institute, and the Space Sciences Laboratory; the system also operates (under federal contract) the nearby Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The campus has museums of art, entomology, zoology, anthropology, and paleontology. Its faculty has included many distinguished scientists, such as Nobel laureates Luis W. Alvarez (physics) and Glenn T. Seaborg (chemistry).
