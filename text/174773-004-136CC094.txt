The General, American silent comedy film, released in 1927, starring and directed by comedian Buster Keaton, and cited by many film historians as one of the greatest American movies. It is set during the American Civil War (1861â€“65) and highlights the theme of personal redemption.
Keaton played Johnny Gray, the engineer of the steam engine The General, who is mistaken for a coward when he is rejected for service in the Confederate Army because he is too valuable to the South as a railway engineer. Fate affords him the opportunity to prove his courage when he engages in a fanatical one-man chase to recover the train after it is stolen by Union spies.
