Győr-Moson-Sopron, megye (county), northwestern Hungary. It is bordered by Austria and Slovakia to the north and the counties of Komárom-Esztergom to the east and Vas and Veszprém to the south. Győr is the county seat. Principal towns also include Sopron, Mosonmagyaróvár, and Kapuvár.
The landscape is dominated by the Little Alfold (Little Hungarian Plain, or Kisalföld). Győr-Moson-Sopron contains some of the country’s richest farmland, supporting the cultivation of sugar beets and apricots, as well as the raising of livestock. In the west-central part of the county is the Hanság, a region of swamps and moorland, partly drained and recovered through canalization. The Sopron Hills in the western part of the county are known for wine making. Between the Danube’s main channel and the Moson arm is the Szigetköz, a low-lying watery flatland with scattered villages that is noted for fishing and wildfowl.
