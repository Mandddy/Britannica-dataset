Jerry Bruckheimer, in full Jerome Leon Bruckheimer  (born Sept. 21, 1945, Detroit, Mich., U.S.) American film and television producer whose many explosion-laden, action-packed movies made him one of Hollywood’s most successful producers.
Bruckheimer, who developed a love for both film and photography while growing up in Detroit, graduated from the University of Arizona in 1965 with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. He embarked on an advertising career in New York City and eventually began producing television commercials, but his interest soon turned to film. In the early 1970s he moved to California and began to work as a producer. Bruckheimer attracted attention with American Gigolo (1979) and had his first major success with Flashdance (1983), which he coproduced with Don Simpson. The two men formed a production company and went on to create a string of blockbusters, including the comedy Beverly Hills Cop (1984), which featured Eddie Murphy, Top Gun (1986), which established Tom Cruise as a star, and Bad Boys (1995). After he and Simpson ended their partnership in 1995, Bruckheimer started producing films on his own, creating such hits as Armageddon (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), and National Treasure (2004).
