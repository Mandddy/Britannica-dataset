Windmill, device for tapping the energy of the wind by means of sails mounted on a rotating shaft. The sails are mounted at an angle or are given a slight twist so that the force of wind against them is divided into two components, one of which, in the plane of the sails, imparts rotation.
Like waterwheels, windmills were among the original prime movers that replaced human beings as a source of power. The use of windmills was increasingly widespread in Europe from the 12th century until the early 19th century. Their slow decline, because of the development of steam power, lasted for a further 100 years. Their rapid demise began following World War I with the development of the internal-combustion engine and the spread of electric power; from that time on, however, electrical generation by wind power has served as the subject of more and more experiments.
