Segura River, Spanish Río Segura,  river in southeastern Spain. It rises in the Segura Mountains in Jaén province and flows east through the driest region of the Iberian Peninsula to enter the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante, a course of 202 miles (325 km). Much water is drawn off the Segura and its major tributary, the Guadalentín (Sangonera), to irrigate adjacent huertas (orchards), especially on the Murcia Plain. Winter and autumn floods are notorious on both rivers, but during the summer the streambeds are almost dry. A number of dams have been built on the Segura and its tributaries to control the winter runoff, the largest being at Fuensanta. The Segura River valley receives water from the Tagus River through a river-diversion scheme, which has been essential for irrigation in Murcia province.
