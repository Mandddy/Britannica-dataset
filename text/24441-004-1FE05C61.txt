Daniel Drew,  (born July 29, 1797, Carmel, N.Y., U.S.—died  Sept. 18, 1879, New York, N.Y.) American railway financier of the 19th-century “robber baron” era.
After a successful career as a cattle trader, Drew bought an interest in a New York-to-Peekskill steamboat in 1834 and six years later established the People’s Line. He also bought control of the Stonington Line on Long Island Sound and operated a steamship service on Lake Champlain. His growing capital enabled him in 1844 to open the Wall Street brokerage firm of Drew, Robinson, and Company, which became one of the principal traders in railroad stocks in the United States. Drew’s association with the Erie Railroad began in 1853. The “Erie War” of 1866–68, in which Drew joined Jay Gould and James Fisk in opposing Cornelius Vanderbilt, who sought to buy control of the Erie Railroad, eventually led to his ruin.
