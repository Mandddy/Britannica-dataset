Airedale terrier, the largest of the terriers, probably descended from the otterhound and an extinct broken-haired dog, the black-and-tan Old English terrier. It is named for the Aire valley, or Airedale, in Yorkshire. Intelligent and courageous, powerful and affectionate, though reserved with strangers, it has been used as a wartime dispatch carrier, police dog, guard, and big-game hunter. It is nicknamed “king of the terriers.”
The Airedale stands about 23 inches (58 cm) and usually weighs from 40 to 50 pounds (18 to 23 kg). It has a boxy appearance, with a long, squared muzzle; in profile, the line of the forehead extends straight to the nose. Its coat is dense and wiry, with a black saddle and with tan legs, muzzle, and underparts.
