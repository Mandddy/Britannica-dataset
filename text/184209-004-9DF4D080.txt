Lyonel Feininger, in full Lyonel Charles Adrian Feininger  (born July 17, 1871, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 13, 1956, New York City) American artist whose paintings and teaching activities at the Bauhaus brought a new compositional discipline and lyrical use of colour into the predominantly Expressionistic art of Germany.
Feininger left the United States for Germany in 1887 to study music but decided to become an artist instead. He studied painting in Hamburg, Berlin, and Paris between 1887 and 1893 and then worked as a cartoonist for German humour magazines and the Chicago Sunday Tribune. About 1910, under the influence of the Cubists—especially Robert Delaunay—he began to receive critical attention and soon established his own style, utilizing prismatic interpenetrating planes of colour. This work, with its intersecting light rays, so impressed the artists of the avant-garde Blaue Reiter (“Blue Rider”) group that Feininger was invited to exhibit with them in Berlin in 1913.
