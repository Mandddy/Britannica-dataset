Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, original name in full Claire Mary Teresa Rawstron  (born March 6, 1944, Gisborne, North Island, New Zealand) critically acclaimed lyric soprano best known for her repertoire of works by Mozart and Richard Strauss.
As a five-week-old infant, she was adopted by Tom and Nell Te Kanawa and given the name Kiri; Tom, like her biological father, was Maori, and his wife, like Kiri’s biological mother, was of Irish descent. Kiri attended a Roman Catholic girls’ college in Auckland, where one of the nuns was a well-known teacher of singing. After leaving school, she won various singing competitions in New Zealand and Australia, and, in 1966, after a period as a popular singer and recording artist, she became a student at the London Opera Centre.
