Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock,  (born July 2, 1724, Quedlinburg, Saxony [Germany]—died March 14, 1803, Hamburg) German epic and lyric poet whose subjective vision marked a break with the rationalism that had dominated German literature in the early 18th century.
Klopstock was educated at Schulpforta, a prestigious Protestant boarding school, where he read John Milton’s Paradise Lost in the translation by the influential Swiss critic Johann Jakob Bodmer. That experience prompted Klopstock to begin planning a great religious epic poem. In 1749 the first three cantos of his Der Messias (The Messiah), written in unrhymed hexameters, appeared in the Bremer Beiträge and created a sensation.
