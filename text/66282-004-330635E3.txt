Paulette Goddard, original name Pauline Marion Goddard Levy  (born June 3, 1905, Great Neck, Long Island, N.Y., U.S.—died April 23, 1990, Ronco, Switz.) American actress known for her spirited persona and for her association with Charlie Chaplin.
Goddard worked as a fashion model in her early teens, and at age 16 she appeared as a chorus girl in the Broadway revue No Foolin’. Within the next four years, she married, divorced, and moved to Hollywood to become a movie star. To that end, she worked as an extra in a number of Hal Roach short comedies and as a chorus girl in several Eddie Cantor movies, including The Kid from Spain (1932). Although still unknown as a performer, she attracted the attention of Charlie Chaplin. They were soon living together and, before she had even starred in a film, Goddard became well known to movie fans as Chaplin’s beautiful companion (there is much uncertainty as to whether they were ever married). For two years Chaplin tutored Goddard in the art of acting, and he displayed the results in his final silent film, Modern Times (1936), in which Goddard portrayed the Gamine, an effervescent female companion to Chaplin’s famous Little Tramp.
