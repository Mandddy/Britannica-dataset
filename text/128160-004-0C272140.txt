João Baptista da Silva Leitão de Almeida Garrett, viscount de Almeida Garrett,  (born Feb. 4, 1799, Porto, Port.—died  Dec. 9, 1854, Lisbon) writer, orator, and statesman who was one of Portugal’s finest prose writers, an important playwright, and chief of the country’s Romantic poets.
Garrett graduated in law from the University of Coimbra in 1820, having already gained a name for himself as a playwright and a fervent liberal. His liberalism forced him into exile in England in 1823, during which time he introduced his countrymen to the new Romantic movement with two patriotic epic poems: Camões (1825) and Dona Branca (1826).
