Dan Andersson, in full Daniel Andersson  (born April 6, 1888, Skattlösberg, Sweden—died September 16, 1920, Stockholm) poet and prose writer, an early practitioner of working-class literature who became one of the few popular Swedish poets.
Born to a poor family headed by a devoutly religious father, Andersson was a woodsman and charcoal burner before he became a temperance lecturer. His first two published volumes, which made the charcoal burners and, incidentally, himself famous, were Kolarhistorier (1914; “Charcoal Burner’s Tales”) and Kolvaktarens visor (1915; “Charcoal Watcher’s Songs”; a selection was translated into English in Charcoal-Burner’s Ballad, &amp; Other Poems, 1943). He published one more book of poems during his lifetime, Svarta ballader (1917; “Black Ballads”), and two autobiographical novels, De tre hemlösa (1918; “The Three Homeless Ones”) and David Ramms arv (1919; “David Ramm’s Heritage”). A considerable part of his verse and prose was published after his death in Efterskörd (1929; “Late Harvest”) and Tryckt och otryckt (1942; “Printed and Unprinted”).
