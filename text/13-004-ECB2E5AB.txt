Kingdom of Burundi, traditional East African state, now the Republic of Burundi. At some time before the 17th century, the Tutsi, a pastoral people, established their dominance over the Hutu agriculturalists living in the area. During his reign (c. 1675–1705) the mwami (king) Ntare Rushatsi (Ntare I) expanded his rule from the central Nkoma area over the neighbouring Bututsi, Kilimiro, and Buyenzi regions. A later king, Ntare II Rugaamba (c. 1795–1852), made further conquests, occupying parts of what is now southern Rwanda and western Tanzania. The organization of the kingdom was decentralized: local princes enjoyed semiautonomy, and conflicts over succession to the kingship were frequent; these became serious in the late 19th century, and by 1900 Ntare Rugaamba’s successor, Mwezi Kisabo, controlled only half the kingdom.
From 1890 Burundi was claimed by the Germans as part of German East Africa, but they never occupied it. It was taken over by the Belgians from the neighbouring Congo during World War I, and after the war it was awarded with Rwanda to Belgium as the League of Nations mandate (later the United Nations trust territory) of Ruanda-Urundi. After World War II Burundians began to press for independence, which was achieved in 1962.
