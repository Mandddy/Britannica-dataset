Jinny Beyer, in full Geraldine Elizabeth Kahle Beyer  (born July 27, 1941, Denver, Colorado, U.S.) American quilt designer, the first to create a line of fabrics especially geared to the needs of quilters. In the 1980s she became a major figure in the resurgence of interest in quilting that had begun to sweep the United States in the late 1970s.
Beyer received a B.A. in speech and French from the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, and an M.A. in special education from Boston University. She began quilting by accident: an avid knitter, she ran out of yarn while living in India in 1972 and looked for another project. She decided to use Indian printed cottons to make a traditional Grandmother’s Flower Garden quilt, giving it a distinctly different flavour from the typical American styles of that time. One of her India-inspired designs, “Ray of Light,” took the grand prize in Good Housekeeping magazine’s 1977 Bicentennial quilt contest, which drew 9,954 entries, and it launched Beyer on her career. Her first book, Patchwork Patterns (1979), specialized in drafting techniques. Further books on quilt history and techniques include The Quilter’s Album of Blocks &amp; Borders (1982), Medallion Quilts (1982), The Scrap Look (1985), Color Confidence for Quilters (1992), Soft-Edge Piecing (1995), and Designing Tessellations (1999); videos include Palettes for Patchwork (1987), Mastering Patchwork (1988), and Color Confidence! (1991).
