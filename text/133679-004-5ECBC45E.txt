Adeline Dutton Train Whitney, née Adeline Dutton Train   (born Sept. 15, 1824, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died March 21, 1906, Milton, Mass.)  American writer whose books, largely for young people, reflected her belief that the home was the ultimate key to virtue.
Adeline Train was the daughter of a prosperous merchant. In 1843 she married Seth D. Whitney, a merchant more than 20 years her senior. She began writing for publication in the late 1850s. Her poems and articles became regular features in local Massachusetts newspapers, and in 1859 she published her first book, Mother Goose for Grown Folks, a collection of characteristically humorous and didactic verses. Boys at Chequasset (1862) and Faith Gartney’s Girlhood (1863), both juvenile novels, won her the audience that was to remain faithfully hers for four decades.
