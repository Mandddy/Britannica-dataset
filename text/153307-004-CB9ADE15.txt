Luna, county, southwestern New Mexico, U.S., bordered on the south by Mexico. It is a region of desert and semiarid plains broken by isolated mountains and mountain ranges, in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range Province. The Continental Divide crosses the western section of the county, which includes the Cooke, Good Sight, Victorio, Cedar Mountain, Florida, and Tres Hermanas ranges and the Carrizalillo Hills. The highest mountains are in the north, topped by 8,408-foot- (2,563-metre-) high Cooke’s Peak. The Mimbres River enters Luna county in the north and passes underground, not to reappear until it reaches the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Recreation areas include Rock Hound and Pancho Villa state parks.
Several Spanish expeditions of exploration entered the region in the late 18th century. During the Mexican War, the U.S. Army’s Mormon Battalion marched through it, their route later becoming part of the Butterfield Trail to California. The region was longtime Apache Indian territory, and, intermittently from 1862 to 1886, Apaches led by chiefs Mangas Coloradas, Cochise, and Geronimo warred with white settlers, travelers, and the U.S. Army. Luna county was established in 1901. In 1916, about 500 Mexican partisans of revolutionary general Pancho Villa attacked Columbus, near the border, in the only foreign attack on the U.S. mainland.
