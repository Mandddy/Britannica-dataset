Gérard de Nerval, pseudonym of Gérard Labrunie  (born May 22, 1808, Paris, France—died January 26, 1855, Paris) French Romantic poet whose themes and preoccupations were to greatly influence the Symbolists and Surrealists.
Nerval’s father, a doctor, was sent to serve with Napoleon’s Rhine army; his mother died when he was two years old, and he grew up in the care of relatives in the countryside at Mortefontaine in the Valois. The memory of his childhood there was to haunt him as an idyllic vision for the rest of his life. In 1820 he went to live with his father in Paris and attend the Collège de Charlemagne, where he met the poet Théophile Gautier, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. Nerval received a legacy from his grandparents and was able to travel in Italy, but the rest of his inheritance he poured into an ill-fated drama review. In 1828 Nerval produced a notable French translation of Goethe’s Faust that Goethe himself praised and which the composer Hector Berlioz drew freely upon for his opera La Damnation de Faust.
