Wesley Snipes ,  (born July 31, 1962, Orlando, Florida, U.S.) American actor best known for his action films, many of which featured martial arts.
Snipes spent his early years in New York Cityâ€™s South Bronx. He studied martial arts from age seven, initially because he was small for his age and needed to defend himself. At age 12, after winning a small role in an Off-Broadway production of The Me Nobody Knows, he decided that performing would be the focus of his future. He studied acting, music, and dance at the High School of the Performing Arts until 1977, when his mother moved the family back to Orlando, Florida. Shortly after receiving a B.A. degree from the State University of New York at Purchase, he made his motion-picture debut in Wildcats (1986) and appeared in a number of theatrical and television productions, including Miami Vice and the soap opera All My Children.
