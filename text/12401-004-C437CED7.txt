William Henry Davies,  (born July 3, 1871, Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales—died  Sept. 26, 1940, Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, Eng.) English poet whose lyrics have a force and simplicity uncharacteristic of the poetry of most of his Georgian contemporaries.
After serving as apprentice to a picture framer, Davies tramped through the United States, crossed the Atlantic many times on cattle boats, lost a foot while trying to jump a train headed for the Klondike region in Canada, became a peddler and street singer in England, and, after several years of this wandering life, published his first volume, The Soul’s Destroyer, and Other Poems (1905). He was then living in London. The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp (1907)—the best known of his prose works—appeared with a preface by George Bernard Shaw, followed by Nature Poems and Others (1908). His poetry includes Forty New Poems (1918), Poems 1930–31 (1932), and The Loneliest Mountain (1939). The first of the collected editions appeared in 1916. Although his work achieved wide popularity, Davies lived the life of a recluse. His Collected Poems appeared in 1942.
