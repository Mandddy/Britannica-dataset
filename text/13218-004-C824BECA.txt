George Balanchine, original name Georgy Melitonovich Balanchivadze   (born January 22 [January 9, Old Style], 1904, St. Petersburg, Russia—died April 30, 1983, New York, New York, U.S.) most influential choreographer of classical ballet in the United States in the 20th century. His works, characterized by a cool neoclassicism, include The Nutcracker (1954) and Don Quixote (1965), both pieces choreographed for the New York City Ballet, of which he was a founder (1948), the artistic director, and the chief choreographer. He was also a pioneer in choreography for film and musical theatre.
Georgy Balanchivadze, a Georgian, was one of a generation of dancers who spent the World War I years at the Imperial School of Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre. The theatre closed for some months in 1917, and, until the Imperial School reopened in 1918 as the Soviet State School of Ballet, he had to support himself with unskilled jobs or by playing piano in a cinema. After three more years of study, he graduated. He was the son of a composer, and he also studied music at the Petrograd (St. Petersburg) Conservatory (1921–24).
