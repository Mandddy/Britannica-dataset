Polyclitus, also spelled Polycleitus or Polykleitos  (flourished c. 450–415 bce) Greek sculptor from the school of Árgos, known for his masterly bronze sculptures of young athletes; he was also one of the most significant aestheticians in the history of art.
Polyclitus’s two greatest statues were the Diadumenus (430 bce; “Man Tying on a Fillet”) and the Doryphoros (c. 450–440 bce; “Spear Bearer”), the latter work being known as the Canon (Greek: Kanon) because it was the illustration of his book by that name. The Canon is a theoretical work that discusses ideal mathematical proportions for the parts of the human body and proposes for sculpture of the human figure a dynamic counterbalance—between the relaxed and tensed body parts and between the directions in which the parts move. In Greece this concept was called symmetria, and Polyclitus’s statues of young athletes, balanced, rhythmical, and finely detailed, were the best demonstration of his principles. His freer use of contrapposto (depiction of the human body with twistings in its vertical axis) helped liberate Greek sculpture from its tradition of rigid frontal poses.
