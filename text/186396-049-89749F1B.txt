Comparative advantage, economic theory, first developed by 19th-century British economist David Ricardo, that attributed the cause and benefits of international trade to the differences in the relative opportunity costs (costs in terms of other goods given up) of producing the same commodities among countries. In Ricardoâ€™s theory, which was based on the labour theory of value (in effect, making labour the only factor of production), the fact that one country could produce everything more efficiently than another was not an argument against international trade.
In a simplified example involving two countries and two goods, if country A must give up three units of good x for every unit of good y produced, and country B must give up only two units of good x for every unit of good y, both countries would benefit if country B specialized in the production of y and country A specialized in the production of x. B could then exchange one unit of y for between two and three units of x (before trade, country B would have only two units of x), and A could receive between one-third and one-half units of y (before trade, country A would have only one-third unit of y) for every unit of x. This is true even though B may be absolutely less efficient than A in the production of both commodities.
