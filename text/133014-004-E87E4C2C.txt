Thomas Savery,  (born c. 1650, Shilstone, Devonshire, Eng.—died  1715, London) English engineer and inventor who built the first steam engine.
A military engineer by profession, Savery was drawn in the 1690s to the difficult problem of pumping water out of coal mines. Using principles adduced by the French physicist Denis Papin and others, Savery patented (1698) a machine consisting of a closed vessel filled with water into which steam under pressure was introduced, forcing the water to a higher level; when the water was expelled, a sprinkler condensed the steam, producing a vacuum capable of drawing up more water through a valve below. To make the effect as nearly continuous as possible, Savery assembled two containing vessels in the same apparatus. An energetic advertising campaign brought him customers, and he manufactured a number of his engines not only for pumping out mines but also for supplying water to large buildings. Savery’s engine had many limitations, notably its weakness under high-pressure steam (above 8 to 10 atmospheres); a few years later, when Thomas Newcomen independently designed his atmospheric-pressure piston engine from another of Papin’s ideas, Savery, who held patent primacy, joined him in its development. Savery also had other inventions to his credit, including an odometer to measure the distances traveled by ships.
