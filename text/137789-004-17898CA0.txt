Bridge of Sighs, Italian Ponte Dei Sospiri,  bridge in Venice, Italy, spanning the narrow canal (Rio di Palazzo) between the Doge’s Palace and the prisons. It was built about 1600 by the architect Antonio Contino. The enclosed passageway was so called from the “sighs” of the prisoners who passed over it.
