Louis Blanc, in full Jean-josephcharles-louis Blanc   (born Oct. 29, 1811, Madrid, Spain—died  Dec. 6, 1882, Cannes, Fr.) French utopian socialist, noted for his theory of worker-controlled “social workshops.”
Louis Blanc was born while his father was serving as inspector general of finances in the Spanish regime of Joseph Bonaparte. When that regime collapsed in 1813, the Blancs returned to France. Louis studied at schools in Rodez and Paris. While working as a tutor in northern France, he came in contact with liberal political circles and found employment on a Republican newspaper. In 1837 he became a member of a committee for electoral reform directed by leaders of the opposition to King Louis-Philippe. In 1839 he founded the Revue du Progrès. It was in this newspaper that his most important work, L’Organisation du travail (“The Organization of Labour”), appeared serially in 1839. The principles laid down in that essay, which first brought him to public attention, formed the basis of his subsequent career.
