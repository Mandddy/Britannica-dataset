Preston Sturges, original name Edmond Preston Biden   (born August 29, 1898, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died August 6, 1959, New York, New York) American motion-picture director, screenwriter, and playwright best known for a series of hugely popular satirical comedies that he made in the early 1940s. Sturges made his mark at a time when talk in large part had supplanted images as the driving force in filmmaking. Because strong dialogue and solid story structure were essential to a film’s success and because both were staples of the writer’s tool kit, the stature of the screenwriter skyrocketed during that era, and Sturges went from being one of Hollywood’s most-in-demand and best-paid scenarists to its first prominent writer-director. The best of the 13 films he directed are tours de force of comic invention and timing, characterized by rapid-fire dialogue, memorably drawn minor characters, and sophisticated irony underlain with pathos.
At age three Sturges was adopted by his gadabout mother’s second husband, Solomon Sturges, a wealthy Chicagoan. Until his parents divorced, when he was age eight, Sturges split his time between Chicago and Europe, where his mother, an intimate of dancer Isadora Duncan, exposed him to museums and the world of art and culture. He was educated primarily in European boarding schools, but his mother sent him back to the United States at the onset of World War I, during which he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Following the war Sturges managed the New York City branch of his mother’s elegant Paris salon (and invented a smear-proof lipstick in the process) before becoming a playwright in the 1920s. After writing the Broadway hit Strictly Dishonorable (1929), he married a prominent New York socialite. However, when his subsequent plays failed to find an audience and his marriage fell apart, Sturges went to Hollywood, where he soon earned a reputation as a scriptwriter.
