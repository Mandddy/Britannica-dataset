Jérôme Lalande, in full Joseph-Jérôme Lefrançais de Lalande, Lefrançais also spelled Le Français, Lefrançois, or Le François   (born July 11, 1732, Bourg-en-Bresse, France—died April 4, 1807, Paris) French astronomer whose tables of planetary positions were considered the best available until the end of the 18th century.
A law student in Paris, Lalande became interested in astronomy while he was lodging at the Hôtel de Cluny, where the noted astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle had his observatory. In 1751 Lalande went to Berlin to make lunar observations in concert with the work of Nicolas Louis de Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope. The success of this task and the subsequent calculation of the Moon’s distance secured for Lalande, before he reached the age of 21, admission to the Academy of Berlin and the post of adjunct astronomer to the Academy of Paris.
