Margaret Bryan Davis, n√©e Margaret Bryan  (born October 23, 1931, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.) American paleoecologist best known for her pioneering work in the science of palynology (the study of plant pollen and spores). Her most-influential work involved the use of pollen recovered from lake sediment and soil to reconstruct ancient plant communities. Her research was instrumental in demonstrating that the structure of biological communities changed in response to environmental factors, such as climatic variation, over time.
Davis spent her childhood and adolescent years in the Boston area. She studied plant physiology and ecology at Radcliffe College, and before she graduated in 1953, she examined pollen deposits of the Quaternary Period (2.58 million years ago to the present) under the direction of American paleobotanist Elso Barghoorn. From 1953 to 1954 Davis studied palynology with Danish palynologist Johannes Iversen at the University of Copenhagen as a Fulbright scholar. As part of her project she collected pollen samples in Greenland that were deposited during an interglacial period (a relatively warm period between ice ages). After marrying American scientist Rowland Davis in 1956, she completed a Ph.D. in biology at Harvard University in 1957.
