Bess beetle (family Passalidae), also called Bess-bug, Betsy Bug, orHorned Passalus Beetle,  any of approximately 500 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) mostly found in the tropics, with a few species found in North America. They are characterized by their large size, ranging between 30 and 40 mm (1.2 and 1.6 inches) in length. Because of their shiny black wing covers (elytra), they are sometimes called patent-leather beetles. They are rather flat and squarish with a horn that points forward on the top of the head.
Bess beetles live together under the bark of decaying logs in a primitive social organization. Both the male and female process decaying wood as food and feed it to the larvae. The only other group of insects that exhibit a similar sharing of work between males and females occurs in termite societies. Bess beetle adults and larvae communicate by sounds that are audible to humans. The adult rubs its wings across rough patches on the abdomen, and the larva rubs its vestigial (degenerate) hind pair of legs against its middle legs.
