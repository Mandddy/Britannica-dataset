Ground cuckoo,  any of about 15 species of birds constituting the subfamily Neomorphinae of the cuckoo family (Cuculidae), noted for terrestrial habits. Of the 11 New World species, three, the striped cuckoo (Tapera naevia), the pheasant cuckoo (Dromococcyx phasianellus), and the pavonine cuckoo (D. pavoninus), are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds.
Other neotropical ground cuckoos include the lesser ground cuckoo (Morococcyx erythropygus), a species 25 cm (10 inches) long, widespread in Central America; five species of Neomorphus, rather large (45 cm [18 inches] long), heavy-billed cuckoos with metallic bluish or bronze plumage, found from Costa Rica to Bolivia; and the two species known as roadrunners (see roadrunner). Two or three species of Carpococcyx, which are even larger (60 cm [24 inches] long), are found in Southeast Asia.
