Leeds, urban area (from 2011 built-up area), city, and metropolitan borough, metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, historic county of Yorkshire, northern England. It lies along the River Aire about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Manchester. The coal and iron ore deposits in the locality, a plentiful supply of soft water from the Aire’s tributaries, and the city’s excellent transportation links through the Pennines helped make it the industrial capital of Yorkshire. It is the largest city in Yorkshire and one of Britain’s major cultural centres.
Leeds originated as an Anglo-Saxon township on the north bank of the Aire. It grew as a local market centre and was incorporated in 1626. By then the town was a cloth-finishing centre for a wide area where domestic weaving, introduced by 14th-century Flemish weavers, was pursued. By the 16th century Leeds was able to challenge the supremacy of York and Beverley in the woolen-manufacturing trade. With the Industrial Revolution and development of the local coalfield, the woolen industry was surpassed in importance by engineering, and for a time pottery and linen manufacture were also important. The completion in 1816 of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal also stimulated Leeds’s growth, and after 1848 the railway made the city a major centre of locomotive engineering. The end of that century saw a great expansion of the factory production of ready-made clothing, drawing labour from an influx of Jewish immigrants into the city.
