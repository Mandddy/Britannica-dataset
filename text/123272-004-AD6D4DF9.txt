Brussels griffon, breed of toy dog developed in late 19th-century Belgium from the affenpinscher and an ordinary street dog. The Brussels griffon is a sturdily built dog and is noted for an intelligent and affectionate nature. It stands about 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 cm) and weighs about 8 to 10 pounds (4 to 5 kg). Typically alert in appearance, it has a domed head with large, dark eyes, a short face, and an upturned nose. The coat may be reddish brown, black, or a combination of the two and appears in two varieties, one rough and wiry and the other smooth. The smooth-coated Brussels griffon is called a petit Braban√ßon.
