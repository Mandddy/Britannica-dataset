Milan Herzog,  (born August 23, 1908, Vrbovec, Croatia—died April 20, 2010, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) Croatian-born American filmmaker who produced hundreds of instructional films for Encyclopædia Britannica Educational Corp. on a wide range of subjects; those films were shown in classrooms across the United States and overseas.
Herzog studied law in Paris and served as a foreign newspaper correspondent, judge, and translator (he was fluent in five languages) in Europe. In 1940, as fighting escalated in World War II, he immigrated with his family to the United States, and he became a U.S. citizen later that year. He subsequently served as department head at the U.S. Office of War Information and worked as a commentator for Voice of America, a government radio broadcasting network. He began his career in Britannica’s film department in 1946 as a highly innovative and dynamic staff producer. Herzog ascended the ranks to become senior vice president of production in 1966, and in 1970 he took the helm of Britannica’s California production facility, where he served until his retirement in 1973. Among his works were dozens of films in the humanities field and an extensive array of foreign-language instruction films, including the 54-title series La Familia Fernández (1963). Herzog pioneered the use of costumed characters in a medieval history film he produced during the 1950s and, for the film Christmas Rhapsody (1955), was the first to use a children’s choir and orchestra to create the musical score. He also conducted a 12-week lecture series on film history at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, and cofounded the North Shore Community Theatre in Evanston, for which he wrote a three-act play. After his retirement from Britannica, Herzog continued to produce films independently in Los Angeles for some 20 years.
