Harvard Mark I, an early protocomputer, built during World War II in the United States. While Vannevar Bush was working on analog computing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), across town Harvard University professor Howard Aiken was working with digital devices for calculation. He had begun to realize in hardware something like the 19th-century English inventor Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, which he had read about. Starting in 1937, Aiken laid out detailed plans for a series of four calculating machines of increasing sophistication, based on different technologies, from the largely mechanical Mark I to the electronic Mark IV.
Aiken was methodically exploring the technological advances made since the mechanical assembly and steam power available to Babbage. Electromagnetic relay circuits were already being used in business machines, and the vacuum tube—a switch with no moving parts, very high speed action, and greater reliability than electromechanical relays—was quickly put to use in the early experimental machines.
