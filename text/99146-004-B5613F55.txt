Rockefeller Center, a 12-acre (5-hectare) complex of 14 limestone buildings in midtown Manhattan in New York City, designed by a team of architects headed by Henry Hofmeister, H.W. Corbett, and Raymond Hood. The group of skyscrapers was built between 1929 and 1940.
Wood veneering, mural painting, mosaics, sculpture, metalwork, and other allied arts were integrated with the architecture as it was being planned and executed. Although much criticized in its early days, Rockefeller Center has since served as a model for other such urban developments. It is a focal point of tourism, particularly in winter when it is home to an ice-skating rink (first installed 1936) in its sunken plaza, which includes the famous Prometheus Fountain statue (1934) designed by Paul Manship and a large Christmas tree (first installed 1933).
