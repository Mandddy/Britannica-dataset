François Girardon,  (born March 10, 1628, Troyes, France—died Sept. 1, 1715, Paris) the most representative sculptor employed on the great sculptural project of decorating Versailles during the period of Louis XIV.
Girardon attracted the attention of Chancellor Pierre Séguier, who brought him to Paris to study under François Anguier and afterward sent him to Rome. Girardon returned to France about 1650, becoming a member of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1657. He worked for Nicolas Fouquet at Vaux-le-Vicomte and, after the minister’s fall, was extensively employed in the decoration of the royal palaces. In 1663 he was working under Charles Le Brun on the Galerie d’Apollon at the Louvre and in 1666 received the commission for his most famous work, the Apollo Tended by the Nymphs, for the Grotto of Thetis at Versailles. The inspiration for this pictorial sculptural work (later moved and its grouping altered) seems to derive partly from Hellenistic sculpture (particularly the Apollo Belvedere) and partly from Nicolas Poussin’s paintings. Of his other works for Versailles, the most notable are the relief of the Bath of the Nymphs (1668–70), perhaps inspired by Jean Goujon’s Fontaine des Innocents, and The Rape of Persephone (1677–79; pedestal completed 1699), in which he challenges comparison with Giambologna’s Rape of the Sabines. The effect of this group is marred by its present situation in the centre of the colonnade at Versailles, where it can be seen from all sides instead of from a fixed viewpoint as originally intended.
