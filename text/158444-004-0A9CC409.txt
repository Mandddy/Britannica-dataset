Sammy Sosa, in full Samuel Sosa Peralta  (born November 12, 1968, San Pedro de Macoris, Dominican Republic) Dominican professional baseball player who, with Mark McGwire, entertained fans with a series of home run races in the late 1990s that rewrote the record books. In 1999 Sosa became the first player to hit 60 homers in two seasons.
As a child, Sosa worked at a number of jobs, including shining shoes, to help support his family following his father’s death. At age 14, using a mitt made from a milk carton, he began playing organized baseball, and in 1985 he signed with the Texas Rangers. In 1989 he made his professional debut but was soon traded to the Chicago White Sox. After struggling at the plate, Sosa was sent across town to the Chicago Cubs in 1992. The following year the right fielder became the team’s first player to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in one season, an achievement he repeated in 1994. In 1995 he made his All-Star Game debut, and during the 1997 season he recorded his 1,000th career hit. Though Sosa was a powerful hitter, he was also undisciplined: his strikeouts (174) outnumbered his hits (161) that year.
