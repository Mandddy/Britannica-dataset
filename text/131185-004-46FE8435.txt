Creep,  in geology, slow downslope movement of particles that occurs on every slope covered with loose, weathered material. Even soil covered with close-knit sod creeps downslope, as indicated by slow but persistent tilting of trees, poles, gravestones, and other objects set into the ground on hillsides. The most important process producing creep, aside from direct gravitational influences, is frost heaving: as interstitial water freezes, surface particles are forced up and out perpendicular to the slope; when let down by melting, these particles are drawn directly downward by gravity and are thereby gradually moved downslope. Other processes involved are the wedging action of root growth and the wetting and drying of soil layers.
