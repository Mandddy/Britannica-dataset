Roland Petit,  (born January 13, 1924, Villemomble, France—died July 10, 2011, Geneva, Switzerland) French dancer and choreographer whose dramatic ballets combined fantasy with elements of contemporary realism.
Trained at the Paris Opéra Ballet school, he joined the company in 1940 but left in 1944 to create and perform his own works at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, in Paris. In 1945 Petit was instrumental in creating Les Ballets des Champs-Elysées, where he remained as principal dancer, ballet master, and choreographer until 1947. In 1948 he formed the Ballets de Paris de Roland Petit (1948–50, 1953–54, 1955, and 1958), which made several tours of Europe and the United States. Dancers who rose to prominence in his companies include Jean Babilée, Colette Marchand, Leslie Caron, and Renée (“Zizi”) Jeanmaire, whom he married in 1954.
