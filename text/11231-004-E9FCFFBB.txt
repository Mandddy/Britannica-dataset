Han Yu, Wade-Giles romanization Han Yü, also called Han Changli or Han Wengong, courtesy name (zi) Tuizhi  (born 768, Heyang [now Mengxian], Henan province, China—died 824, Chang’an [now Xi’an], Shaanxi province) master of Chinese prose, outstanding poet, and the first proponent of what later came to be known as Neo-Confucianism, which had wide influence in China and Japan.
An orphan, Han initially failed his civil service exams because the examiners refused to accept his unconventional prose style, but he eventually entered the bureaucracy and served in several high government posts. At a time when the popularity of Confucian doctrine had greatly declined, Han began a defense of it. He attacked Daoism and Buddhism, which were then at the height of their influence. So outspoken was he that he castigated the emperor for paying respect to the supposed finger bone of the Buddha; this act of criticism almost cost Han his life and caused him to be banished to South China for a year. In defending Confucianism, Han quoted extensively from the Mencius, the Daxue (“Great Learning”), the Zhongyong (“Doctrine of the Mean”), and the Yijing (“Classic of Changes”; known to many as I-Ching), works that hitherto had been somewhat neglected by Confucians. In so doing, he laid the foundations for later Neo-Confucianists who took their basic ideas from these books.
