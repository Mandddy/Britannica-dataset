Kiddush, also spelled Qiddush (Hebrew: “sanctification”),  Jewish benediction and prayer recited over a cup of wine immediately before the meal on the eve of the sabbath or of a festival; the ceremony acknowledges the sanctity of the day that has just begun. Chanting, or recitation, usually performed by the head of the household, may involve several or all members of the family, depending on the custom; each then sips wine from the cup, which was held in the right hand during the benediction. In the Ashkenazi (German) tradition, two covered loaves of bread (halloth) on the table symbolize the double portion of manna gathered before the sabbath by Israelites during their years of wandering in the wilderness. If no wine is available, bread may be used as a substitute.
Following an ancient custom from the days when wayfarers and the poor lodged in synagogues, some congregations recite the Kiddush at the end of the Friday-evening service in the synagogue—except on the eve of the Passover (Pesaḥ), when the recitation is reserved for the Seder service. The Kiddush that is recited after the morning service of the sabbath and of the festival is preceded by appropriate readings from the Bible.
