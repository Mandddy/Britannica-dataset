Sea of Azov, Russian Azovskoye More, orAzovskoe More,  inland sea situated off the southern shores of Ukraine and Russia. It forms a northern extension of the Black Sea, to which it is linked on the south by the Kerch Strait. The Sea of Azov is about 210 miles (340 km) long and 85 miles (135 km) wide and has an area of about 14,500 square miles (37,600 square km). Into the Sea of Azov flow the great Don and Kuban rivers and many lesser ones such as the Mius, the Berda, the Obitochnaya, and the Yeya. In the sea’s western part lies the Arabat Spit, a 70-mile- (113-kilometre-) long sandbar that separates it from the Syvash, a system of marshy inlets that divides the Crimean Peninsula from the Ukrainian mainland.
With a maximum depth of only about 46 feet (14 m), the Azov is the world’s shallowest sea. Vast quantities of silt are brought down by the Don and Kuban rivers, so that in the Taganrog Gulf in the northeast, the sea’s depth is 3 feet (1 m) or less. The discharge of these rivers ensures that the sea’s waters are low in salinity, being almost fresh in the Taganrog Gulf. The Syvash is highly saline, however. The Sea of Azov’s north, east, and west shorelines are low and have long sandspits and shallow gulfs and lagoons in various stages of silting up. Its southern shore is mainly high and jagged, however. The topography of the sea’s floor is generally level.
