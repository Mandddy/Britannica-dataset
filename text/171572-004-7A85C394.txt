Priscian, Latin in full Priscianus Caesariensis   (flourished c. 500 ce, Caesarea, Mauretania [now Cherchell, Algeria]) the best known of all the Latin grammarians, author of the Institutiones grammaticae, which had a profound influence on the teaching of Latin and indeed of grammar generally in Europe.
Though born in Mauretania, Priscian taught in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). His minor works include De nomine, pronomine et verbo (“On Noun, Pronoun, and Verb”), for the teaching of grammar in schools; a treatise on weights and measures; a treatise on the metres of Terence; Praeexercitamina, an adaptation for Latin readers of some Greek rhetorical exercises; a panegyric in verse on the emperor Anastasius I; and a verse translation of Dionysius’s Periegesis. Priscian’s Institutiones grammaticae (“Grammatical Foundations”) is an 18-volume exposition of Latin grammar. As far as possible Priscian took as his guides the works of Apollonius Dyscolus on Greek grammar and Flavius Caper on Latin grammar. He drew illustrative citations from many Latin authors and in this way was able to preserve numerous fragments that would otherwise have been lost.
