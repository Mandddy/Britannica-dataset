Ferdinand I,  (born Aug. 24, 1865, Sigmaringen, Prussia [now in Germany]—died July 20, 1927, Bucharest, Rom.) king of Romania from 1914 to 1927, who, though a Hohenzollern and a believer in German strength, joined the Allies in World War I.
The son of Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Ferdinand was adopted as crown prince of Romania in 1889 by his uncle, King Carol I, whose only child had died. In 1893 he married Lady Marie, daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh and granddaughter of Queen Victoria and of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. Though retiring in nature and occasionally vacillating, Ferdinand showed considerable interest in Romanian military affairs and commanded the army during the Second Balkan War (1913). When his uncle died he succeeded to the Romanian throne in October 1914. Early in World War I he waited on events before finally casting his lot with the Allied powers (August 1916). With the occupation of Bucharest by the Germans late in 1916, he moved his beleaguered government to Iași. In April 1917 he averted a potentially revolutionary situation when he promised land reform and the right to vote to an assemblage of Romanian peasant troops, but he failed to arrive at definitive solutions for either the agrarian problem or the shortcomings of democracy in the postwar years.
