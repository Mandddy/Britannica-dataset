Cock-of-the-rock,  either of two species of brilliantly coloured birds of tropical South America, usually included in the family Cotingidae (order Passeriformes) but sometimes placed in a family of their own, Rupicolidae. They are noted for the malesâ€™ flattened circular crest extending over the bill. During much of the year, males display in open glades near the forest floor, maintaining and defending communal display areas. Much of the individual display consists of static posturing, interspersed with stylized eye-catching movements, especially when the display arena is visited by a female. The plain-brown female builds the nest of plant materials plastered with mud against a rock wall, usually in a cave.
The Guianan cock-of-the-rock, Rupicola rupicola, about 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, is orange, with some dark marked feathers on wings and tail.
