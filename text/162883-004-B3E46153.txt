Jack Conroy, byname of John Wesley Conroy, pseudonym Tim Brennan, or John Norcross  (born December 5, 1899, near Moberly, Missouri, U.S.—died February 28, 1990, Moberly, Missouri) leftist American writer best known for his contributions to “proletarian literature,” fiction and nonfiction about the life of American workers during the early decades of the 20th century.
Conroy, who was born in a coal camp, was a migratory worker in the 1920s. He first became known in 1933 with his critically acclaimed novel The Disinherited. This largely autobiographical book depicts the coming of age of a coal miner’s son during the Great Depression. From 1931 to 1941 Conroy edited successively the magazines Rebel Poet, Anvil, and New Anvil. He included works by Erskine Caldwell, Langston Hughes, and William Carlos Williams, among others. Conroy later edited, with Curt Johnson, a collection of these pieces, Writers in Revolt: The Anvil Anthology (1973).
