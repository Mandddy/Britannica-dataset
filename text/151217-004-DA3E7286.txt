Great Man-Made River (GMR), a network of underground pipelines bringing high-quality fresh water from ancient underground aquifers deep in the Sahara to the coast of Libya for domestic use, agriculture, and industry. The GMR was originally conceived as having several arms, or phases, though not all have been built and some may never be. Nevertheless, since 1991 the project has supplied much-needed irrigation and drinking water to populous cities and farming areas in Libya’s north, which previously were dependent on desalination plants and on declining rain-fed aquifers near the coast.
Water was first discovered in the Al-Kufrah area in Libya’s southeastern desert in the 1950s during exploration drilling for oil. Subsequent analysis indicated that this find was part of the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, a vast reservoir of “fossil water” that is anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 years old, water having percolated into the sandstone before the end of the last ice age, when the Saharan region enjoyed a temperate climate. Initially, the Libyan government planned to set up large-scale agricultural projects in the desert where the water was found, but plans were changed in the early 1980s, and designs were prepared for a massive network of pipelines to the coast.
