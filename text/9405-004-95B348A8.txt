Conjuring, also called magic, prestidigitation, or sleight of hand,  the theatrical representation of the defiance of natural law. Legerdemain, meaning “light, or nimble, of hand,” and juggling, meaning “the performance of tricks,” were the terms initially used to designate exhibitions of deception. The words conjuring and magic had no theatrical significance until the end of the 18th century. Descriptions of magical demonstrations were recorded in Egypt as early as 2500 bce. Such accounts reflect an inevitable mix of fact and fantasy, a quality they share with even their most modern counterparts.
One of the tenets of magic—indeed, one employed and exploited by some of its foremost practitioners—is that spectators cannot perceive correctly the miraculous effects they have witnessed. Perhaps conjurers have always understood that when viewers are in a state of amazement, their capacity for accurate recall is diminished. The use of psychology, therefore, is one of the principal techniques of the conjurer, especially in the practice of misdirection, in which a spectator’s attention is directed to a specific point determined by the performer. The knowledge of scientific principles, the implementation of ingenious mechanical devices, and impressive physical dexterity are also essential tools of the successful magician.
