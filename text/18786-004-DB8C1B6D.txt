New Haven, county, south-central Connecticut, U.S. It is bordered to the south by Long Island Sound, to the southwest by the Housatonic River, and to the southeast by the Hammonasset River. The countyâ€™s terrain consists of rolling plateaus and river valleys to the north and coastal lowlands to the south; the sound contains several islands. Other waterways include the Naugatuck, Quinnipiac, and Wepawaug rivers as well as Lakes Gaillard, Saltonstall, and Quassapaug. Parklands include Naugatuck State Forest Reserve and Sleeping Giant, West Rock Ridge, and Hammonasset Beach state parks.
English Puritans founded New Haven colony in 1638, and it reluctantly joined Connecticut colony (1665) and became a county in 1666; county government was abolished in 1960. Initially dependent on agriculture and maritime trade, the economy became industrialized in the 19th century, spurred by the inventions of New Haven residents Eli Whitney, who developed the concept of mass-producing interchangeable parts, and, later, Charles Goodyear, who created the vulcanization process for rubber. Manufacturing remains important, although services and trade have passed it in terms of value.
