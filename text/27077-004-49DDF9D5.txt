MiG, officially ANPK imeni A.I. Mikoyana also called ANPK MiG formerly OKB-155,  Russian aerospace design bureau that is the country’s major producer of jet fighter aircraft. It developed the family of technologically advanced MiG aircraft, including the Soviet Union’s first jet fighter. The MiG design bureau is part of the state-owned multifirm aerospace complex VPK MAPO (Military-Industrial Complex–Moscow Aircraft Production). Headquarters are in Moscow.
The MiG design bureau is institutionally part of the larger MiG Aircraft Building Corporation. The latter corporation employs 15,000 people, 2,500 of whom work for the design bureau. Since its formation at the beginning of World War II, the bureau has been involved in about 250 different aircraft projects, of which 120 reached the construction stage. In that time, its main manufacturing plant in Moscow has built more than 15,000 aircraft. At the start of the 21st century more MiG-designed fighter aircraft, accounting for roughly 20 percent of the world’s fighters, were in service than any other type. The company also has a subsidiary production facility at Lukhovitsy. The MiG and Sukhoy design bureaus evenly share the Russian fighter market, but hard times in the 1990s prompted the former to engage in vigorous marketing abroad to countries in the Middle East, South Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe and to diversify modestly into the civilian passenger plane market.
