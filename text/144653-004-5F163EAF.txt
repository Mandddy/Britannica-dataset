Kābul River, Ancient Greek Kophes,  river in eastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, 435 miles (700 km) long, of which 350 miles (560 km) are in Afghanistan. Rising in the Sanglākh Range 45 miles (72 km) west of Kabul city, it flows east past Kabul and Jalālābād, north of the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, and past Peshawar; it joins the Indus River northwest of Islamabad. The river has four major tributaries—the Lowgar, the Panjshēr, the Konar (Kunar), and the Alīngār.
The Kābul River crosses two major climatic belts. Its upper reaches have a continental warm-summer climate with a mean July temperature of about 77 °F (25 °C) and a mean January temperature below 32 °F (0 °C); annual precipitation there is less than 20 inches (500 mm), although precipitation is higher on the mountain slopes around its headwaters. In its lower reaches in Pakistan, the Kābul River crosses a region with a dry desert climate, with maximum daily temperatures in early summer that often exceed 104 °F (40 °C) and mean monthly temperatures in winter above 50 °F (10 °C).
