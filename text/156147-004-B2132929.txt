Lempa River, Spanish Río Lempa,  river in Central America. It rises in Guatemala near Esquipulas, crosses a corner of Honduras, and enters El Salvador at Citalá. After cutting across El Salvador’s northern mountain range, it flows eastward for over 80 miles (130 km) and then southward for 65 miles (105 km) across the southern mountain range to enter the Pacific Ocean after a total course of about 200 miles (320 km). It is El Salvador’s largest and only navigable one. Its northern valley has hydroelectric projects that supply power to much of El Salvador. Its southern basin has been developed agriculturally, sisal (a cordage fibre) being the major crop.
