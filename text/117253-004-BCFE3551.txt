Mount Etna, Latin Aetna, Sicilian Mongibello,  active volcano on the east coast of Sicily. The name comes from the Greek Aitne, from aithō, “I burn.” Mount Etna is the highest active volcano in Europe, its topmost elevation being about 10,900 feet (3,320 metres). Like other active volcanoes, its height varies: in 1865, for example, the volcanic summit was about 170 feet (52 metres) higher than it was in the early 21st century. Etna covers an area of some 600 square miles (1,600 square km); its base has a circumference of about 93 miles (150 km).
Etna has been studied systematically since the middle of the 19th century. Three observatories have been set up on its slopes; they are located at Catania, Casa Etnea, and Cantoniera.
