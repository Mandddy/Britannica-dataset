Johann Clauberg,  (born Feb. 24, 1622, Solingen, duchy of Berg [Germany]—died  Jan. 31, 1665, Duisburg, Brandenburg) philosopher and theologian who became the foremost German proponent of the thought of the French philosopher René Descartes.
After study at Bremen and in the Netherlands at Groningen and after travel in France and England, Clauberg encountered Cartesian philosophy in lectures by the Dutch thinker Johan de Raey at Leiden, Neth. From 1649 to 1651 Clauberg served as professor of philosophy and theology at the academy of Herborn, Nassau (an academy that was conducted according to the Reformation theology of John Calvin), and he soon distinguished himself as the leading Cartesian in Germany and the Netherlands. Opposition to his views from colleagues, particularly from a professor of rhetoric, C. Lentz, influenced Clauberg to accept an appointment as head of the Gymnasium, or secondary school, at Duisburg in 1651. Two years later he was commissioned to teach philosophy and theology there and was named rector in 1655, when the school became a university.
