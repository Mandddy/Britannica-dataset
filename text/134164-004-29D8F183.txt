Maria Konopnicka, original name Marja Wasiłowska, pseudonym Jan Sawa  (born May 23, 1842, Suwałki, Poland—died  October 8, 1910, Lemberg, Austria-Hungary [now Lviv, Ukraine]) author of short stories and one of the representative Positivist poets in Polish literature. (The Positivists espoused a system of philosophy emphasizing in particular the achievements of science.)
Konopnicka, a lawyer’s daughter, rebelled against her landowner husband, who was much older than she, and moved to Warsaw. Subsequently, she spent most of her life moving from one place to another and made prolonged stays in western Europe. Her cycle of poems Italia (1901; “Italy”) contains some memorable images of her travels. Pan Balcer w Brazylii (1910; “Mr. Balcer in Brazil”), one of her most ambitious works, was conceived as a near-epic poem describing the bitter experience of the Polish immigrants in South America. Among her short stories, the best-known include “Niemczaki” (“The German Kids”) and “Nasza szkapa” (“Our Old Mare”). She also wrote poems and stories for children. Konopnicka was further noted for her translations of foreign authors, such as Heinrich Heine, Gerhart Hauptmann, Edmondo De Amicis, Gabriele D’Annunzio, and Edmond Rostand.
