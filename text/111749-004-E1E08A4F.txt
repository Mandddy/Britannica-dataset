The Staple Singers, American vocal group that was one of the most successful gospel-to-pop crossover acts ever, collecting several Top 20 hits in the early 1970s. The members included Roebuck (“Pops”) Staples (b. December 28, 1914, Winona, Mississippi, U.S.—d. December 19, 2000, Dolton, Illinois), Mavis Staples (b. July 10, 1939, Chicago, Illinois), Cleotha Staples (b. April 11, 1934, near Drew, Mississippi—d. February 21, 2013, Chicago), Pervis Staples (b. November 1935, near Drew), and Yvonne Staples (b. October 23, 1938, Chicago).
Any barriers between the sacred and the sensual that Aretha Franklin may have left standing were blown away by Mavis Staples and her thrilling contralto. Begun by Mavis’s guitarist father, Roebuck, in the early 1950s, the Staple Singers included her sisters Cleotha and Yvonne (the latter joined after the group had been performing for a while) and her brother Pervis (who left in the early 1970s). As a teenager, Roebuck had picked cotton at Dockery’s plantation, where he was influenced by legendary guitarist Charley Patton and other seminal blues musicians, and he moved to Chicago in the mid-1930s. By the mid-1950s his terse lead guitar and the family’s otherworldly harmonies had made the Staples a leading gospel group. They recorded memorable versions of “Uncloudy Day” (1959) and other sacred classics for the Vee Jay label.
