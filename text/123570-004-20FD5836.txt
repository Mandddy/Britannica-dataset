Tugela River,  principal river of KwaZulu/Natal province, South Africa. It rises as a stream on the 10,000-foot- (3,050-metre-) high Mont-aux-Sources plateau near the merger point of the Lesotho–Free State province borders. Its upper course, which lies within Royal Natal National Park, flows through the Drakensberg range before hurtling down in a series of waterfalls having a total drop of 3,110 feet (948 m). The river then cuts through Tugela Gorge at the foot of the escarpment (about 5,000 feet [1,500 m] above sea level), is quickly joined by many tributaries, passes through the Ladysmith Basin, and, below Colenso, becomes narrow and deep. At Jameson’s Drift it enters the wide, open Tugela Trough, at the eastern end of which it cuts deeply through a great block of sandstone to issue onto the coastal plain.
The Tugela ends its course of 312 miles (502 km) at the Indian Ocean, about 52 miles (84 km) north of Durban, its mouth almost completely blocked in times of normal flow by a sandbar. The river is navigable only in the lagoon formed behind the sandbar. Its narrow valley and scanty alluvial deposits restrict irrigation. The Spioenkop Dam (1973), west of Colenso and southwest of Ladysmith, regulates flow. Upstream, water from the Tugela headwaters is diverted across the Drakensberg into the more highly developed Vaal basin.
