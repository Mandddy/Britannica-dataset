Denali National Park and Preserve, vast region with an unspoiled natural environment of alpine tundra and boreal forest (taiga) in south-central Alaska, U.S. It lies roughly equidistant from Fairbanks to the northeast and Anchorage to the south-southeast and is some 200 miles (320 km) south of the Arctic Circle, in the subarctic climate zone. The park and preserve were created in 1980, encompassing the former Mount McKinley National Park (1917) and an additional 6,405 square miles (16,590 square km). In 1976 it was designated by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve.
The park has an area of 7,408 square miles (19,187 square km). The preserve adds another 2,085 square miles (5,400 square km) and adjoins the park in two units, one on the northwest and the other on the southwest; in addition, Denali State Park borders the national park on the southeast. National park headquarters are at the parkâ€™s entrance in the northeast corner. A ranger station at Talkeetna, 100 miles (160 km) south of the entrance, manages mountaineering activities in the park.
