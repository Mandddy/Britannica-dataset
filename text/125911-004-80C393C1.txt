Ice cave,  cavity in ice or an underground cave that has permanent ice deposits. The two types of ice cave are wholly unrelated.
The first type of ice cave is formed by meltwater streams carving labyrinths in the bases of glaciers or by streams and wind hollowing out tunnels in snowfields. These usually have scalloped, translucent walls that transmit a blue light.
