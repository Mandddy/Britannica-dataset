Fritz Reuter,  (born Nov. 7, 1810, Stavenhagen, Mecklenburg-Schwerin [Germany]—died  July 12, 1874, Eisenach, Ger.) German novelist who helped to initiate the development of regional dialect literature in Germany. His best works, which mirrored the provincial life of Mecklenburg, are written in Plattdeutsch, a north German dialect.
As a youthful member of a student political club, Reuter was sentenced to death by the Prussian authorities in 1833, but the sentence was later commuted to 30 years’ imprisonment. Though released under the amnesty of Frederick William IV after seven years’ imprisonment, he never fully regained his health. The success of his early Plattdeutsch poems and stories led him to attempt more ambitious works in his native dialect. Ut de Franzosentid (1859; “During the Time of the French Conquest”) presents, with a mixture of seriousness and humour, life in a Mecklenburg country town during the War of Liberation against Napoleon. Ut mine Festungstid (1862; “During the Time of My Incarceration”) is an account of his last few years in prison told without bitterness. Ut mine Stromtid (1862–64; “During My Apprenticeship”) is considered his masterpiece. In this work, originally issued in three volumes, Reuter’s resemblance to Charles Dickens as a great storyteller and as a creator of characters is most apparent; its humorous hero, Entspektor Bräsig, is as memorable as Mr. Pickwick.
