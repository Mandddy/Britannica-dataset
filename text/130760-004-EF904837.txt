Microprocessor,  any of a type of miniature electronic device that contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry necessary to perform the functions of a digital computerâ€™s central processing unit. In effect, this kind of integrated circuit can interpret and execute program instructions as well as handle arithmetic operations.
The microprocessor was developed in the late 1970s as a result of large-scale integration (LSI), which made it possible to pack thousands of transistors, diodes, and resistors onto a silicon chip less than 0.2 inch (5 mm) square. During the early 1980s very-large-scale integration (VLSI) vastly increased the circuit density of microprocessors. A single VLSI circuit holds hundreds of thousands of electronic components on a chip identical in size to the LSI circuit.
