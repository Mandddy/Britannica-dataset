Cathode ray, stream of electrons leaving the negative electrode (cathode) in a discharge tube containing a gas at low pressure, or electrons emitted by a heated filament in certain electron tubes. Cathode rays focused on a hard target (anticathode) produce X-rays or focused on a small object in a vacuum generate very high temperatures (cathode-ray furnace). When cathode rays strike certain molecules used to coat a cathode screen, they cause the molecules (and hence the screen) to emit light. This effect, when coupled with the controlled deflection of a cathode ray by electric or magnetic fields, gives rise to the cathode-ray oscilloscope (cathode-ray tube [CRT]) for monitoring variations and values of an alternating voltage or current and to the picture tube of television and radar.
