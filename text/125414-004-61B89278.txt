Robert Cummings, in full Charles Clarence Robert Orville Cummings   (born June 10, 1908, Joplin, Mo., U.S.—died  Dec. 2, 1990, Woodland Hills, Calif.) American actor who starred in motion pictures and television.
Cummings studied at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and Drury College before assuming false identities in order to become an actor. He won his first Broadway stage role in 1931 by acquiring a British accent and calling himself Blade Stanhope Conway. He became a film actor by assuming a southern drawl and calling himself a Texan, Brice Hutchens. Under his own name, he won critical acclaim for dramatic film roles in King’s Row (1942), Saboteur (1942), The Lost Moment (1947), and Dial M for Murder (1954); films such as The Devil and Miss Jones (1941) and Princess O’Rourke (1943) revealed his flair for light satire. Altogether, he played lead roles in over 100 films.
