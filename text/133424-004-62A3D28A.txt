Ferenc Szálasi,  (born Jan. 6, 1897, Kassa, Hung., Austria-Hungary—died  March 12, 1946, Budapest) soldier and politician who was the fascist leader of Hungary during the last days of World War II.
Following family traditions, Szálasi entered the army and became a captain on the general staff in 1925. He joined a secret organization with a racist program in 1930 and, after early retirement from the army in 1935, founded the Party of National Will. Though his party was completely unsuccessful at the polls, Szálasi continued his radical, nationalistic agitations, later helped by German support. His program was based on chauvinism and anti-Semitism.
