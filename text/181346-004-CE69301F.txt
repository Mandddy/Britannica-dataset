Augustus De Morgan,  (born June 27, 1806, Madura, India—died March 18, 1871, London, England) English mathematician and logician whose major contributions to the study of logic include the formulation of De Morgan’s laws and work leading to the development of the theory of relations and the rise of modern symbolic, or mathematical, logic.
De Morgan was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1828 he became professor of mathematics at the newly established University College in London, where, except for a period of five years (1831–36), he taught until 1866, when he helped found and became the first president of the London Mathematical Society. One of his earliest works, Elements of Arithmetic (1830), was distinguished by a simple yet thorough philosophical treatment of the ideas of number and magnitude. In 1838 he introduced and defined the term mathematical induction to describe the process that until then had been used with little clarity in mathematical proofs.
