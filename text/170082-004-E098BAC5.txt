Wilhelm Raabe, pseudonym Jakob Corvinus   (born September 8, 1831, Eschershausen, near Hildesheim, Braunschweig—died November 15, 1910, Braunschweig, Germany) German writer best known for realistic novels of middle-class life.
After leaving school in Wolfenbüttel in 1849, Raabe was apprenticed for four years to a Magdeburg book dealer, during which time he read widely. Although he attended lectures at Berlin University, the important product of his time in Berlin was his popular first novel, published under his pseudonym, Die Chronik der Sperlingsgasse (1857; “The Chronicle of Sperling Street”), which depicts episodes in the lives lived out on one small street. In 1856 Raabe returned to Wolfenbüttel, determined to make a living as a writer. He published a number of novels and story collections, none of which attracted much attention, and then set out to travel through Austria and Germany.
