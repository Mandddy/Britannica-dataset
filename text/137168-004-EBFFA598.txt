Cesar Pelli,  (born Oct. 12, 1926, Tucumán, Arg.) Argentinian-born American architect who was widely regarded as one of the 20th century’s preeminent architects.
After earning a bachelor’s degree in architecture at the National University of Tucumán, Pelli moved to the United States to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he received a master’s degree in 1954. He began his professional career with the firm of Eero Saarinen and Associates in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Hamden, Conn., where, among other projects, he worked on the Trans World Airlines Terminal at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. Pelli was director of design at Daniel, Mann, Johnson, &amp; Mendenhall in Los Angeles from 1964 to 1968 and at Gruen Associates, also in Los Angeles, from 1968 to 1977. During those years he perfected the technology of glass skins, producing buildings of lightweight, translucent quality. He served as dean of the School of Architecture at Yale University from 1977 to 1984 and established (1977) his own practice, Cesar Pelli and Associates (now Pelli Clarke Pelli) in New Haven, Conn. During this period the taut style of his early work evolved into stone-clad buildings of greater sculptural quality.
