Callisto, also called Jupiter IV ,  outermost of the four large moons (Galilean satellites) discovered around Jupiter by the Italian astronomer Galileo in 1610. It was probably also discovered independently that same year by the German astronomer Simon Marius, who named it after Callisto of Greek mythology. Callisto is a dark, heavily cratered body of rock and ice that appears to have remained substantially unaltered inside and out for the past four billion years.
Callisto has a diameter of about 4,800 km (3,000 miles)—less than 100 km (60 miles) shy of the diameter of the planet Mercury—and it orbits Jupiter at a mean distance of about 1,883,000 km (1,170,000 miles). The bulk density of Callisto is 1.83 grams per cubic cm, a little more than half that of Earth’s Moon, which indicates that Callisto is about half rock and half ice. Spacecraft measurements of its gravity field indicate that, unlike the other Galilean moons, this satellite is not differentiated. Its interior thus must resemble a raisin pudding, with rock and ice well mixed, instead of exhibiting the core-mantle structure found within Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Nevertheless, Callisto has a weak magnetic field induced by Jupiter’s field, which raises the possibility that a conducting layer of salty liquid water exists somewhere below its surface.
