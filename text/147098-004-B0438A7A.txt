Piers Morgan, in full Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan, original name Piers Stefan O’Meara  (born March 30, 1965, Guildford, Surrey, England) British journalist and media figure who attracted controversy as a tabloid editor for his aggressive tactics in breaking stories and who later achieved international fame as a television personality. He hosted the talk show Piers Morgan Tonight (later Piers Morgan Live) on CNN (2011–14).
Morgan grew up in southern England. He displayed an affinity for journalism at age 15, when he wrote an article for a local newspaper about his village’s cricket team, and he went on to study the subject at Harlow College in Essex. After working as a reporter for papers in south London, he was hired in 1989 as the show-business editor at the tabloid The Sun, at the time the most widely read daily newspaper in the United Kingdom. The position allowed Morgan to socialize with celebrities, and he managed to boost his own public profile by frequently posing for photographs with them.
