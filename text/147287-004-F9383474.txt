Nummulite, any of the thousands of extinct species of relatively large, lens-shaped foraminifers (single-celled marine organisms) that were abundant during the Paleogene and Neogene periods (65.5 million to 2.6 million years ago). Nummulites were particularly prominent during the Eocene Epoch (55.8 million to 33.9 million years ago), and limestone of this age that occurs in the Sahara is called nummulite limestone in reference to the great abundance of its contained fossil nummulites.
