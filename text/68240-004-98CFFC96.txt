Ernst Heinrich Heinkel,  (born Jan. 24, 1888, Grunbach, Ger.—died  Jan. 30, 1958, Stuttgart, W.Ger.) German designer and builder of the first rocket-powered aircraft shortly before the outbreak of World War II.
Heinkel’s first plane, constructed in 1910, crashed and burned. Continuing his work, he became chief designer for the Albatros Aircraft Company in Berlin before the beginning of World War I. After the war he organized (1922) the Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke in Warnemünde, where he built the He 70, which set eight world speed records in the early 1930s; the He 176, first aircraft to fly successfully with reaction motors; the He 178, first turbojet-powered aircraft; and the He 111 and He 162, widely used by Germany’s air force during World War II. Though he fell into disfavour with the Nazis late in the war, he was arrested by the Allies and tried for war crimes; he was released after the trial. Because his firm had been dissolved, he began a new company in 1950 to manufacture bicycles, motorbikes, and midget autos.
