Soft-coated wheaten terrier, breed of dog developed from the terriers kept as farm dogs in Ireland. It was recognized by the Irish Kennel Club in 1937 and brought to the United States in the 1940s. The American Kennel Club accepted the breed into the regular classes in 1973.
The soft-coated wheaten terrier is a lively, playful breed that retains its puppylike exuberance into adulthood. Like many terriers, it can be stubborn, though it responds to patient training. As its name indicates, it has a distinctive single coat in a golden tan colour; in puppies the coat is somewhat darker and lightens as the animal matures. The adult coat is soft, shiny, and wavy over the whole body, including the head and legs. Some dogs have darker or blue-gray ears and muzzle. A medium-sized dog, the soft-coated wheaten terrier stands 17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm) and weighs 30 to 40 pounds (14 to 18 kg).
