Bill Haley, in full William John Clifton Haley, Jr.  (born July 6, 1925, Highland Park, Michigan, U.S.—died February 9, 1981, Harlingen, Texas) American singer and songwriter considered by many to be the father of rock and roll, thanks to his 1955 hit “Rock Around the Clock.”
If not the father of rock and roll, Haley is certainly one of its fathers. He cut his first record in 1948 and the next year settled into a job as a disc jockey in Chester, Pennsylvania. At the time, his groups played a small-band version of western swing, and Haley continued recording country songs until 1951, when he covered (rerecorded) Jackie Brenston’s stomping rhythm-and-blues hit “Rocket 88.” Although his version sold poorly, Haley was intrigued with the possibility of selling big-beat music to teenagers, so he dropped his cowboy image and changed the band’s name from the Saddlemen to Bill Haley and His Comets. In a conscious effort to capture the growing teen audience, he also incorporated the music of jump-blues stars into his sound (and later speculated that through them he was probably influenced by Louis Jordan). It worked, and Haley’s self-written “Crazy Man Crazy” (1953) is often considered the first rock-and-roll record to hit the Billboard pop charts. Haley’s original Comets were arguably the first self-contained rock-and-roll band and featured the booming slapped bass of Al Rex (b. July 15, 1921, New York City, New York, U.S.—d. March 3, 1985, New York City), John Grande (b. January 14, 1930, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—d. June 2, 2006, Clarkesville, Tennessee, U.S.) on the boogie piano, the screaming saxophone of Rudy Pompilli (b. April 16, 1924, Chester, Pennsylvania—d. February 5, 1976, Brookhaven, Pennsylvania), and the guitar interplay between Danny Cedrone (b. June 20, 1920, Jamesville, New York—d. June 17, 1954, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and Billy Williamson (b. February 9, 1925, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania—d. March 22, 1996, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania).
