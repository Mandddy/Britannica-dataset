Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov,  (born June 18 [June 6, old style], 1812, Simbirsk [now Ulyanovsk], Russia—died  Sept. 27 [Sept. 15, O.S.], 1891, St. Petersburg) Russian novelist and travel writer, whose highly esteemed novels dramatize social change in Russia and contain some of Russian literature’s most vivid and memorable characters.
Goncharov was born into a wealthy merchant family and, after graduating from Moscow University in 1834, served for nearly 30 years as an official, first in the Ministry of Finance and afterward in the Ministry of Censorship. The only unusual event in his uneventful life was his voyage to Japan made in 1852–55 as secretary to a Russian admiral; this was described in Fregat Pallada (1858; “The Frigate Pallas”).
