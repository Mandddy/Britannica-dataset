Robert Smith Surtees,  (born May 17, 1805, The Riding, Northumberland, Eng.—died March 16, 1864, Brighton, Sussex) English novelist of the chase and the creator of Mr. Jorrocks, one of the great comic characters of English literature, a Cockney grocer who is as blunt as John Bull and entirely given over to fox hunting.
A younger son, Surtees worked as a lawyer until he inherited his family’s estate in 1838. But riding to hounds was his passion, and nearly all his writing involved horses and riding. Surtees’ earliest works were published in The Sporting Magazine, and in 1831, with Rudolph Ackermann as publisher, he launched the New Sporting Magazine (N.S.M.), editing it until 1836. His novels appeared as serials in the N.S.M. or elsewhere or in monthly parts before final publication in book form, and these first and last dates are given after their titles. Jorrocks’ Jaunts and Jollities (1831, 1838), a collection of tales (a prototype for Charles Dickens’s Pickwick Papers), Handley Cross (1843, expanded 1854), and Hillingdon Hall (1843, 1845) all feature Mr. Jorrocks. There followed Hawbuck Grange (1846, 1847); Mr. Sponge’s Sporting Tour (1849, 1853); Ask Mamma (1857, 1858); Plain or Ringlets? (1858, 1860); and Mr. Romford’s Hounds (posthumous, 1865). Connoisseurs generally put first the chronicles of Soapey Sponge and Facey Romford, whose chief business is to pass off dangerous horses as tractable animals. In nearly all these books Surtees was fortunate to have as illustrators John Leech and Hablot Knight Browne (“Phiz”), the illustrator of the Pickwick Papers. All were also published anonymously, with Surtees’ name appearing only on his first book, the factual Horseman’s Manual (1831).
