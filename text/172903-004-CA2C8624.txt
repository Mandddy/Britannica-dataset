Kostís Palamás,  (born January 13, 1859, Patras, Greece—died February 27, 1943, Athens) Greek poet who was important in the evolution of modern Greek literature.
Palamás was educated at Mesolongion and at Athens and became the central figure in the Demotic movement of the 1880s, which sought to shake off traditionalism and draw inspiration for a new Greek literary and artistic style from the life and language of the people. Palamás became the founder of the “new school of Athens,” which condemned Romantic exuberance and reverted to a more restrained type of poetry. In 1886 Palamás published his first collection of poems, Tragoudia tes Patridos mou (“Songs of My Country”), followed by Iamboi kai Anapaestoi (1897; “Iambs and Anapaests”), Asalefte Zoe (1904; Life Immovable), Dodecalogos tou Gyftou (1907; “The Twelve Lays of the Gypsy”), and I flogera tou Vasilia (1910; “The King’s Flute”).
