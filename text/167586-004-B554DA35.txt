Aardwolf (Proteles cristatus), insectivorous carnivore that resembles a small striped hyena. The shy, mainly nocturnal aardwolf lives on the arid plains of Africa. There are two geographically separate populations, one centred in South Africa and the other in East Africa.
The aardwolf, whose name in Afrikaans means “earth wolf,” is yellowish with vertical black stripes and a bushy black-tipped tail. Standing less than half a metre high at the shoulder, it varies in length from 55 to 80 cm (22 to 31 inches) exclusive of the 20- to 30-cm (8- to 12-inch) tail. Weight is from 8 to 12 kg (18 to 26 pounds). Like the hyena, it has a long coarse ridge of erectile hairs along the length of the back, sturdy shoulders, and longer front than hind legs. The aardwolf, however, is less of a runner and has five toes on the front feet instead of four. The skull is not as robust, but the sharp canine teeth and strong jaws characteristic of hyenas are retained and wielded in aggressive interactions. The cheek teeth, however, are mere pegs adequate for crunching its insect diet, which consists almost exclusively of harvester termites. When the aardwolf smells termites or hears the rustle of thousands of them in the grass with its sensitive pointed ears, it laps them up with its sticky tongue.
