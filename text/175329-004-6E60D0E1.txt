Lady and the Tramp, American animated musical film, released in 1955, that, with its affecting love story featuring dogs, became one of Walt Disney’s most endearing movies.
A sweet-natured celebration of love—even by Disney standards—the story concerns the romance between Lady, an upper-class cocker spaniel, and Tramp, a stray dog from the wrong side of the tracks. When Lady’s formerly loving owners have a baby, they stop paying as much attention to their pet, and, following a run-in with two cruel Siamese cats also staying in her owners’ house, Lady runs away. She meets up with Tramp, and they share a night of adventures together as he helps her to see the high points of life without owners. Though their spree culminates in a trip to the pound, she manages to find her way back home—and to take Tramp with her.
