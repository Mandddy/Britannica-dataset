Herbert Lom, original name in full Herbert Charles Angelo Kuchacevich ze Schluderpacheru  (born 1917, Prague, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]â€”died September 27, 2012, London, England) Czech actor whose brooding looks and versatility allowed him a highly diverse screen career, though he was perhaps best known for his work in the Pink Panther film series.
Lom was born to a titled but fading aristocratic family. Sources differ on his birth date, giving either January 9 or September 11. He studied acting in Prague and performed onstage before immigrating in 1939 to England, where he attended the Embassy School of Acting. Following the outbreak of World War II, Lom took a position as a radio announcer for the BBC. He performed in two films before leaving Prague, and in 1942 he returned to the screen, playing Napoleon in The Young Mr. Pitt. He achieved greater recognition after appearing as a psychiatrist treating a repressed young amnesiac in the popular film The Seventh Veil (1945). In the 1950 noir Night and the City, Lom played a dangerous figure in the high-stakes underground world of professional wrestling.
