ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Khān,  (born c. 1844, Kabul, Afghanistan—died 1901, Kabul) amīr of Afghanistan (1880–1901) who played a prominent role in the fierce and long-drawn struggle for power waged by his father and his uncle, Aʿẓam Khān, against his cousin Shīr ʿAlī, the successor of Dōst Moḥammad Khān.
ʿAbd al-Raḥmān was the son of Afẕal Khān, whose father, Dōst Moḥammad Khān, had established the Barakzāi dynasty in Afghanistan. Shīr ʿAlī’s victory in 1869 drove ʿAbd al-Raḥmān into exile in Russian Turkistan, where he lived at Samarkand until Shīr ʿAlī’s death in 1879, a year after the outbreak of the war between the British and the Afghans. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān returned to Afghanistan in 1880, was heartily welcomed by his people, and remained in northern Afghanistan until the British negotiated a settlement recognizing ʿAbd al-Raḥmān as amīr in return for his acknowledgment of the British right to control his foreign relations. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān pacified the country and consolidated his authority. During the years 1880–87, he crushed a revolt by the powerful Ghilzai tribe and an unexpected rebellion led by his cousin Isḥāq Khān; he also decisively defeated Shīr ʿAlī’s son Ayūb, who raided intermittently from his base in Herāt.
