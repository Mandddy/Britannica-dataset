Thjórs River, Icelandic Thjórsá,  longest stream in Iceland. Rising from the central plateau northeast of Hofsjökull (Hofs Glacier), it flows southwestward for 143 miles (230 km) and then discharges into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of Selfoss. The Thjórs River and its largest tributary, the Tungna (80 miles [129 km] long), carry away meltwater from Hofsjökull, Vatnajökull (Vatna Glacier), and several smaller glaciers while draining a basin of 2,907 square miles (7,530 square km), the lower third of which is part of the island’s most extensive farming region. Because of its size and its location in the densely populated southwest, the Thjórs generates more electrical power than any other stream in Iceland.
