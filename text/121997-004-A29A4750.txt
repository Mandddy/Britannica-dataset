Cao Cao, Wade-Giles romanization Ts’ao Ts’ao, courtesy name (zi) Mengde  (born  155 ce, Qiaoxian [in modern Bozhou, Anhui province], China—died 220, Luoyang [in modern Henan province]) one of the greatest of the generals at the end of the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce) of China.
Cao’s father was the adopted son of the chief eunuch of the imperial court. Cao was initially a minor garrison commander and rose to prominence as a general when he suppressed the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which threatened the last years of Han rule. The dynasty, however, was greatly weakened by the rebellion, and in the ensuing chaos the country was divided among the major generals into three kingdoms. Cao occupied the strategic northern section around the emperor’s capital at Luoyang. He took the emperor with him and moved the capital to Xuxian (present-day Xuchang, Henan province). By invoking the emperor’s name, he took command of the other generals and gradually assumed all imperial prerogatives. His domain was known as the kingdom of Wei.
