Rhamphorhynchus (genus Rhamphorhynchus), flying reptile (pterosaurs) found as fossils from the Late Jurassic Period (159 million to 144 million years ago) in Europe that had a diamond-shaped rudder at its tip of its tail. Rhamphorhynchus was about 50 cm (20 inches) long, with a long skull and large eyes; the nostrils were set back on the beak. The teeth slanted forward and interlocked and were probably used to eat fish. The body was short, and each thin wing membrane stretched from a long fourth finger. The wing membrane probably attached near the hind limbs (see also pterosaur).
