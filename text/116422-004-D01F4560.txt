Pochard (tribe Aythyini),  any of the 14 to 16 species of diving ducks of the tribe Aythyini (family Anatidae, order Anseriformes), often called bay ducks.
Pochards are round-bodied, big-headed, rather silent birds of deep water; they dive well, with closed wings, to feed chiefly on aquatic plants. All lack a metallic wing mark, but most species show some white in the wings. Drakes commonly are black or gray with red heads, hens are plain brown. The nest is either a scraped hollow or a mound of reeds, and the hen lays 7–17 buff or dark greenish eggs. Along seacoasts and on the bigger lakes, where most species spend the winter, “rafts” of pochards are a familiar sight.
