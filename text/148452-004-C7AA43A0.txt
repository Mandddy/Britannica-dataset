Malware, in full malicious software,  malicious computer program, or “malicious software,” such as viruses, trojans, spyware, and worms. Malware typically infects a personal computer (PC) through e-mail, Web sites, or attached hardware devices.
Malware may be used to take over PCs, turning them into zombie computers that may form part of a “botnet” used to send out spam or perform denial of service attacks on Web sites. In addition, malware has been used to distribute pornography and unlicensed software. Owners of infected PCs often become aware of a problem only as their machines become progressively slower or they find unidentifiable software that cannot be removed.
