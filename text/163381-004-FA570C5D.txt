George A. Romero, in full George Andrew Romero  (born February 4, 1940, New York, New York, U.S.) American film director, writer, and producer best known for his contributions to the horror movie genre.
After graduating in 1961 from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, Romero filmed short segments for Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, a popular children’s television series produced in Pittsburgh. In 1968 Romero and several friends pooled their money to finance Romero’s first feature, the low-budget zombie film Night of the Living Dead. The movie was not a commercial success at the time of its release, but it was eventually recognized as a horror masterpiece, and it served as the foundation for a unique mythos. The Romero zombie was unrelated to the Vodou zombie that had influenced most zombie lore until that point. Instead, it was a shambling corpse that fed upon the living, and it became a mainstay in film and fiction.
