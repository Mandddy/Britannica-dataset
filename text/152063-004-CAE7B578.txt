Dahshūr, ancient pyramid site just south of Ṣaqqārah, northern Egypt, on the west bank of the Nile River. Dahshūr and other ruins in the area of ancient Memphis—Abū Ṣīr, Ṣaqqārah, Abū Ruwaysh, and the Pyramids of Giza—were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.
Two of its five extant pyramids date from the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 bce) and were built by King Snefru (reigned 2575–51). The earlier one, because of its peculiar double slope, is variously called the Blunted, Bent, False, or Rhomboidal Pyramid. It represents an early attempt to build a true pyramid, but the initial angle of slope (52°) was found to be too steep; the top portion of the pyramid was thereupon reduced to 43.5°. The best-preserved of the five, it is the only Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 bce) pyramid with two entrances. The second of Snefru’s pyramids at Dahshūr, the North Pyramid (Red Pyramid), was built at the lower slope angle of 43° and is therefore shorter. It is the first true pyramid successfully completed.
