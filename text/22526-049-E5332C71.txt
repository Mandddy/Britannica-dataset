Ruhr, river and major industrial region along its course, North Rhine-Westphalia Land (state), western Germany. The river, an important tributary of the lower Rhine, rises on the north side of Winterberg and flows 146 mi (235 km) west past Witten (the head of navigation), Essen, and Mülheim to enter the Rhine at Duisburg. The Ruhr functions chiefly as a supplier of water and is dammed in many places to form lakes and reservoirs. Nearby canals carry the bulk of the water traffic. Its chief affluents are the Möhne (right) and Lenne (left).
The river has given its name to one of the world’s largest single industrial regions. Although the Ruhrgebiet, or Ruhr, is not strictly an administrative or political entity, it is geographically defined as extending from the left bank of the Rhine east to Hamm and from the Ruhr River north to the Lippe; a wider definition would include the Rhine River cities of Krefeld and Düsseldorf and the urban belt extending eastward from Düsseldorf through Wuppertal to Hagen. This is Germany’s most densely populated region. The Ruhr coalfield (extending west of the Rhine and north of the Lippe) is one of the world’s largest, producing the bulk of Germany’s bituminous coal. Steel production and diversified chemical manufacturing constitute the other basic industries of the region, which is served by an extensive inland-waterway system and one of Europe’s densest railway networks.
