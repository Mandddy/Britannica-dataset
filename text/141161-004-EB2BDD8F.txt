Tusculum, ancient Italic city (modern Frascati) in Latium, 15 miles (24 km) southeast of Rome, a favourite resort of wealthy Romans under the late republic and the empire (1st century bc–4th century ad). Tusculum was a Latin settlement during the early Iron Age (early 1st millennium bc) and was probably under Etruscan influence. According to Roman tradition, Octavius Mamilius of Tusculum, son-in-law of the last Roman king, organized a league of 30 Latin cities against Rome in the late 5th century bc, but he was defeated and killed in a battle at Lake Regillus in about 496, which established Roman supremacy over the Latins. Thereafter, Tusculum usually was Rome’s loyal ally in wars against Aequi, Volsci, Gauls, and, most famously, the Carthaginians led by Hannibal. In 381 bc Tusculum became the first Latin city to obtain Roman citizenship, but it did join other Latin cities in the revolt of 340 bc. Tusculum held the status of municipium (a community that exercised partial rights of Roman citizenship) during the late republican and early imperial periods. Marcus Porcius Cato, “the Censor” (234–149 bc), was born in Tusculum.
The Roman writer Cicero had a villa near Tusculum in the 1st century bc and composed several philosophical works, including Tusculanae disputationes (“Conversations at Tusculum”), there. In the early medieval period, Tusculum was an important stronghold, and its counts were influential at Rome. The Romans finally destroyed it during a war in 1191.
