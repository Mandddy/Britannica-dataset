George Stevens,  (born December 18, 1904, Oakland, California, U.S.—died March 8, 1975, Lancaster, California) American director known for films that exhibited intelligence, great humanism, and brilliant camera techniques. His classic movies include the screwball comedy Woman of the Year (1942), the action-adventure Gunga Din (1939), and the dramas A Place in the Sun (1951) and Giant (1956).
Stevens, who was born to professional actors, began performing onstage at the age of five. He remained in his father’s theatrical troupe as an actor and, eventually, a stage manager. While still a teenager, he entered the film industry as a cameraman, and in the early 1920s he became a cinematographer at Hal Roach Studios. His first production there was the Laurel and Hardy short Roughest Africa (1923). Stevens shot a number of other two-reelers starring the comedy duo, including Sugar Daddies (1927), Two Tars (1928), and Below Zero (1930).
