Serge Lifar,  (born April 2, 1905, Kiev—died  Dec. 15, 1986, Lausanne, Switz.) Russian-born French dancer, choreographer, and ballet master (1929–45, 1947–58) of the Paris Opéra Ballet who enriched its repertoire, reestablished its reputation as a leading ballet company, and enhanced the position of male dancers in a company long dominated by ballerinas.
Lifar was introduced to dance in 1920 by Bronislava Nijinska, under whom he began to study. Brought to France to join Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, Lifar studied with the eminent teacher Enrico Cecchetti and became premier danseur of the company in 1925 and created the title roles in a number of George Balanchine’s early ballets, including The Prodigal Son (1929). Lifar was a dramatic and athletic dancer who had a charismatic stage presence. The first ballet he himself choreographed was Le Renard (1929; “The Fox,” music by Igor Stravinsky).
