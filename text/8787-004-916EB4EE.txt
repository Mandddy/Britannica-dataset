Andrzej Wajda,  (born March 6, 1926, Suwałki, Poland—died October 9, 2016, Warsaw) leading director and screenwriter in the “Polish film school,” a group of highly talented individuals whose films brought international recognition to the Polish cinema during the 1950s.
Wajda became interested in the visual arts when working as assistant to a restorer of old church paintings in Radom. He studied painting at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków and then film directing at the Leon Schiller State Theatre and Film School at Łódź. His debut feature, Pokolenie (1955; A Generation), is considered to have launched the wave of films credited to the Polish film school. With Kanał (1957; Canal) and Popiół i diament (1958; Ashes and Diamonds), it constituted a trilogy that dealt in symbolic imagery with sweeping social and political changes in Poland during the World War II-era German occupation, the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, and the immediate postwar years. The three films won Wajda significant attention, including prizes at international film festivals, and Popiół i diament, which was based on a Jerzy Andrzejewski novel, became especially renowned. Its lead actor, Zbigniew Cybulski, became famous for his portrayal of a young man whose idealism survives the humiliation and defeat of the occupation and the deaths of friends and the woman he loves.
