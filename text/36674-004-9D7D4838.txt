Hugh Miller,  (born Oct. 10, 1802, Cromarty, Cromartyshire, Scot.—died  Dec. 24, 1856, Edinburgh) Scottish geologist and lay theologian who was considered one of the finest geological writers of the 19th century and whose writings were widely successful in arousing public interest in geologic history.
After early literary ventures and a six-year period as a bank accountant in Cromarty, Miller went to Edinburgh in 1840 as editor of the newly founded newspaper The Witness. The newspaper, which opposed patronage in the Church of Scotland, gained a wide reputation through Miller’s leading articles. He also wrote a brilliant geological series for it, part of which was published in book form as The Old Red Sandstone (1841). In this work he described his discoveries, in Cromarty, of fossils found in formations of the Devonian strata (approximately 416 million to 359 million years ago).
