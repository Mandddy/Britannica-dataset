Arthur Penn, in full Arthur Hiller Penn   (born September 27, 1922, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died September 28, 2010, New York, New York) American motion-picture, television, and theatre director whose films are noted for their critical examination of the darker undercurrents of American society.
A child of divorce, Penn spent the early years of his life with his peripatetic mother and then, as a teenager, went to live with his father, a watchmaker, in Philadelphia. (His older brother Irving Penn became a renowned photographer.) While stationed in South Carolina during service in the U.S. Army (1943–46), Penn became involved with a local theatre group in which he met Fred Coe, who later became a prolific television producer. After seeing action during World War II, Penn remained in Europe as a civilian to manage an entertainment unit known as the Soldiers Show Company. Under the G.I. Bill he studied literature at Black Mountain College in North Carolina (where he came in contact with composer John Cage, choreographer Merce Cunningham, painters Willem de Kooning and Robert Rauschenberg, and architect R. Buckminster Fuller) and in Italy before attending Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.
