Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., Japanese Kawasaki Jūkōgyō Kk,  major Japanese manufacturer of transportation equipment and machinery and an important member of the Kawasaki group of industries. The company maintains head offices in both Kōbe and Tokyo.
The original enterprise was a shipyard established by Kawasaki Shōzō in 1878. In 1886 Kawasaki established another shipyard in Kōbe and, upon the merger of the two in 1896, formed the Kawasaki Shipyard Company. Its present name was adopted in 1939, after it had expanded into the manufacturing of railroad equipment, steel plates, aircraft, and machinery. The company’s production of freighters was augmented by that of submarines during World War II and of supertankers in the postwar decades. After World War II the company was broken up by the U.S. occupation authorities, but, after its merger with two of its previous subsidiaries in 1969, it again became a major corporation. Kawasaki remained one of Japan’s leading shipbuilders until the 1970s, after which its machinery, aircraft, and rolling-stock divisions became more important.
