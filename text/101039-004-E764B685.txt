Kunikida Doppo, also called Kunikida Kamekichi  (born Aug. 30, 1871, Chōshi, Chiba prefecture, Japan—died  June 23, 1908, Chigasaki, Kanagawa prefecture) writer whose short stories, deeply imbued with a Wordsworthian awareness of nature, brought to Japanese literature a new attitude toward the individual.
Kunikida grew up in southern Japan but went to Tokyo to enter Tokyo Senmon Gakkō (later Waseda University), where he adopted Christianity in 1889. He had already started to read the works of Ivan Turgenev, Thomas Carlyle, and Ralph Waldo Emerson when he went in 1893 to teach school in Saeki, on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. That year, reinforced by his reading of William Wordsworth’s poetry, was crucial in the development of his passionate devotion to nature. He returned to Tokyo, where he became a war correspondent for the newspaper of the influential critic and historian Tokutomi Sohō during the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). His dispatches were collected and entitled Aitei tsūshin (“Letters to My Dear Brother”). Azamukazaru no ki (“Diary Without Deceit”) covered the personally tormented years of 1893–97, during which he married and was deserted by his first wife, who later served as the model for the heroine of the novel Aru onna (1919; A Certain Woman) by Arishima Takeo.
