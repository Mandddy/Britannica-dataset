Li Qingzhao, Wade-Giles romanization Li Ch’ing-chao, literary name (hao) Yi’an Jushi, also called Li Yi’an  (born 1084, Jinan, Shandong province, China—died after 1155, Jinhua, Zhejiang province) China’s greatest woman poet, whose work, though it survives only in fragments, continues to be as highly regarded as it was in her own day.
Li Qingzhao was born into a literary family and produced well-regarded poetry while still a teenager. In 1101 she married Zhao Mingcheng, a noted antiquarian, but their marriage was cut short in 1129 by his death during their escape from the Juchen dynasty’s takeover of Kaifeng, the capital of the Song dynasty. Continuing alone, she arrived at Hangzhou by 1132. Two years later she fled to Jinhua, where she died, probably after 1155.
