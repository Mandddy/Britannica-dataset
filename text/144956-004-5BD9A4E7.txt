In 1852 California University was founded as an academy, giving instruction from the kindergarten to college levels. The academy was chartered as a normal (teacher-training) school in 1865 and renamed South Western Normal School in 1874. The school was acquired by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1914 and converted to a two-year school for training elementary teachers. Renamed California State Teachers College in 1928, the school once again became a four-year, degree-granting institution. The graduate program began in 1962. In 1983 the school was elevated to university status, received its current name, and became part of Pennsylvania’s State System of Higher Education.
