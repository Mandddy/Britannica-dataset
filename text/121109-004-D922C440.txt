Akkad, ancient region in what is now central Iraq. Akkad was the northern (or northwestern) division of ancient Babylonian civilization. The region was located roughly in the area where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (see Tigris-Euphrates river system) are closest to each other, and its northern limit extended beyond the line of the modern cities of Al-Fallūjah and Baghdad. The early inhabitants of this region were predominantly Semitic, and their speech is called Akkadian. To the south of the region of Akkad lay Sumer, the southern (or southeastern) division of ancient Babylonia, which was inhabited by a non-Semitic people known as Sumerians.
The name of Akkad was taken from the city of Agade, which was founded by the Semitic conqueror Sargon in about 2300 bce. Sargon united the various city-states in the region and extended his rule to encompass much of Mesopotamia. After the fall of Sargon’s dynasty in about 2150 bce, the central Iraq region was ruled by a state jointly composed of Sumerians and Akkadians.
