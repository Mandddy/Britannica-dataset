Globe, sphere or ball that bears a map of the Earth on its surface and is mounted on an axle that permits rotation. The ancient Greeks, who knew the Earth to be a sphere, were the first to use globes to represent the surface of the Earth. Crates of Mallus is said to have made one in about 150 bce. The earliest surviving terrestrial globe was made in Nürnberg in 1492 by Martin Behaim, who almost undoubtedly influenced Christopher Columbus to attempt to sail west to the Orient. In ancient times, globes also were used to represent the constellations; the earliest surviving globe is the marble Farnese globe, a celestial globe dating from about 25 ce.
Today’s globe, typically hollow, may be made of almost any light, strong material, such as cardboard, plastic, or metal. Some are translucent. They may also be inflatable. Terrestrial globes are usually mounted with the axis tilted 23.5° from the vertical, to help simulate the inclination of the Earth relative to the plane in which it orbits the Sun. Terrestrial globes may be physical, showing natural features such as deserts and mountain ranges (sometimes molded in relief), or political, showing countries, cities, etc. While most globes emphasize the surface of the land, a globe may also show the bottom of the sea. Globes also can be made to depict the surfaces of spherical bodies other than the Earth, for example, the Moon. Celestial globes are also still in use.
