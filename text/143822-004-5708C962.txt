New Acropolis Museum, museum in Athens, Greece, built to house the archaeological remains of the ancient Acropolis site that were formerly housed in the original Acropolis Museum (first opened in 1876). The New Acropolis Museum opened in June 2009.
The simple exterior of the 226,000-square-foot (21,000-square-metre) building, designed by Swiss American architect Bernard Tschumi, was intended to resemble the nearby Parthenon. In addition to adjusting the dimensions and modeling the columns to mirror those of the Parthenon exactly, Tschumi’s design also incorporated seismic technology in anticipation of the region’s frequent earthquakes. Among the museum’s many treasures are artifacts from the Archaic, Classical, and Roman periods. All were found in the Parthenon, on the slopes of the Acropolis, or in other extant structures on the site. Notable works from the collection include the original Caryatids, the relief of Nike Adjusting Her Sandal, and portions of the Parthenon frieze. The museum also has hundreds of marble sculptures.
