Genet, any of about 14 species of lithe catlike omnivorous mammals of the genus Genetta, family Viverridae (order Carnivora). Genets are elongate short-legged animals with long tapering tails, pointed noses, large rounded ears, and retractile claws. Coloration varies among species but usually is pale yellowish or grayish, marked with dark spots and stripes; the tail is banded black and white. Adult genets weigh 1–2 kg (2.2–4.4 pounds) and are about 40–60 cm (16–24 inches) long, excluding the 40–55-cm tail.
Except for the small-spotted genet (G. genetta), which also occurs in western Asia and southern Europe, they are found only in Africa. Genets live alone or in pairs and are active mainly at night. They frequent forests, grasslands, and brush and are as agile in the trees as on the ground. They prey on small mammals and birds. Litters contain two or three young.
