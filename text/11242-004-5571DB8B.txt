Golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), a species of hamster commonly kept as a pet. Like other hamsters, it has a stout body with short, stocky legs and short, wide feet with small, sharp claws. The head has small, furry ears and huge internal cheek pouches that open inside the lips and extend to behind the shoulders. The tail is stubby and can be either white or pink.
Golden hamsters are small rodents, usually weighing more than 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) and having a body length up to 18 cm (7.1 inches); females are usually larger than males. In wild populations and in animals designated “normal variety” by breeders, the short fur is dense and very soft, with golden brown upperparts and white or cream underparts extending up onto the body behind the head. More than 120 varieties have been bred for particular coat types. The result is a bewildering range of fur colours, patterns, and texture combinations.
