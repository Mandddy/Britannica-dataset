Pudding,  any of several foods whose common characteristic is a relatively soft, spongy, and thick texture. In the United States, puddings are nearly always sweet desserts of milk or fruit juice variously flavoured and thickened with cornstarch, arrowroot, flour, tapioca, rice, bread, or eggs. The rarer savoury puddings are thickened vegetable purées, soufflé-like dishes, or like corn pudding, custards. Hasty pudding is a cornmeal mush.
In Britain the word pudding is used as a generic term for sweet desserts. In addition to dessert puddings of the American type are boiled puddings of fruit enclosed in a suet crust; steamed puddings made of leavened batter; boiled puddings of sweetened dough or pastry, often mixed with dried or fresh fruit; and rich boiled puddings of which the Christmas plum pudding represents the acme: mixtures of dried fruits (the original dried plums having been replaced by raisins and currants hundreds of years since), candied fruit peels, spices, breadcrumbs, chopped suet, eggs, and brandy or other spiritous flavouring.
