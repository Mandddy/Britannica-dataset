Lajos Kossuth,  (born Sept. 19, 1802, Monok, Hung.—died  March 20, 1894, Turin, Italy) political reformer who inspired and led Hungary’s struggle for independence from Austria. His brief period of power in the revolutionary years of 1848 and 1849, however, was ended by Russian armies.
Kossuth’s father came of Slovak, his mother of local German stock. The family was noble and of ancient creation but not wealthy, and Kossuth’s father earned his living as an attorney for local landowning families. The Kossuths were Lutherans, and young Lajos studied at the Protestant academy of Sárospatak. After applying unsuccessfully for a post in government service, he found employment in his native county of Zemplén as agent to one of his father’s clients, Countess Etelka Andrássy, with whom he formed an attachment. He did notable work during the great cholera epidemic of 1831 but found his life narrow and frustrating; he was also suffering, as he would all his life, from financial embarrassment. In 1832 his employer had him sent to the national Diet in Pozsony (now Bratislava) as substitute delegate for one of her relatives.
