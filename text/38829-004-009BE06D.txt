Sir John Perrot,  (born 1528, Haroldston, Pembrokeshire, Wales—died November 3, 1592, London, England) lord deputy of Ireland from 1584 to 1588, who established an English colony in Munster in southwestern Ireland.
Perrot was long reputed to be the illegitimate son of King Henry VIII of England, but that claim has been strongly challenged in contemporary scholarship. His mother was Mary Berkeley, who was married to Thomas Perrot of Pembrokeshire at the time of John’s birth. He was knighted in 1549 and was appointed president of Munster by Queen Elizabeth I in 1570. After suppressing the Munster rebellion of James (Fitzmaurice) Fitzgerald, he pardoned the rebels and returned to England (1573). In 1584 he was sent back to Ireland as lord deputy. He confiscated vast lands in Munster for plantation by English settlers, but the colonization was poorly organized and executed. He did succeed, however, in bringing the native landowners of Connaught under English law by having them pay the crown a fixed money rent. In return, they avoided losing lands to plantations.
