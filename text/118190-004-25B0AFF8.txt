Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), also called mayflower or mandrake,  perennial herbaceous plant of the family Berberidaceae (order Ranunculales) native to eastern North America, most commonly in shady areas on moist, rich soil.
Its plant is 30 to 45 cm (12 to 18 inches) tall. Its dark green, umbrella-like leaves, nearly 30 cm across, have five to seven lobes. The cup-shaped flower, with six to nine white petals, is 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) across and appears from April to June. The fruit is an edible yellow berry that is sometimes used in jams or beverages; the unripened fruit is toxic. The dried rhizomes (fleshy underground stems) are used medicinally; they contain anticancer compounds and are the source for a treatment of genital warts. The plant is a coarse but attractive specimen for the shady wild garden.
