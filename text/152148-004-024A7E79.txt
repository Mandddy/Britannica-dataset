Courland, also spelled Kurland, Latvian Kurzeme,  region on the Baltic seacoast, located south of the Western Dvina River and named after its inhabitants, the Latvian tribe of Curonians (Kurs, Cori, Cours; Latvian: Kursi). The duchy of Courland, formed in 1561, included this area as well as Semigallia (Zemgale), a region located east of Courland proper.
After the Order of the Brothers of the Sword (from 1237 the Livonian Knights, or Order of the Teutonic Knights of Livonia) conquered the Latvian lands north of the Western Dvina, it mounted a crusade (c. 1220s) against the Curonians, who had established their own tribal kingdom by the end of the 9th century. In 1230 the Curonian king Lammekinus (Lamikis), in order to avoid the orderâ€™s rule, made peace directly with the papal legate, accepted baptism, and became a vassal of the pope. But the order refused to honour this arrangement. The Knights prevented the king from receiving his crown from the pope and, after obtaining nominal possession of two-thirds of the country from the bishop of Courland (1234), subjugated the Curonians (1269) and ruled them as their feudal lords for the next 300 years.
