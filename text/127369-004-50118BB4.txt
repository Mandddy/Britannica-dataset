Cribbage, card game in which the object is to form counting combinations that traditionally are scored by moving pegs on a special cribbage board. The appeal of the game, usually played by two but with a popular variant played by four or occasionally by three, is evident from two facts: few changes have been made in the original rules, and it remains one of the most popular of all card games. In the United States cribbage is played by more than 10 million people, principally across the northern states from New England to the Pacific, and the game has remained popular in Canada as well. In Great Britain one to two million players compete in nationwide leagues, to which might be added a comparable number of casual players.
Though commonly credited to the invention of the 17th-century English poet Sir John Suckling, cribbage clearly developed from an earlier game called noddy, which also used a special scoring board, as did the related but more-complicated game of costly colours, described by Charles Cotton in The Compleat Gamester (1674) and current in parts of England until nigh on the 20th century. Cribbage would quite likely have become the most popular of all two-hand card games if so many descriptions had not called the cribbage board indispensable, which it is not.
