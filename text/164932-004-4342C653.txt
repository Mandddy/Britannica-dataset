Heinrich Schütz, Latin Henricus Sagittarius   (born October 8, 1585, Köstritz, Saxony [now in Germany]—died November 6, 1672, Dresden) composer, widely regarded as the greatest German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach.
In 1599 he became a chorister at Kassel, where the landgrave of Hesse-Kassel provided him with a wide general education. In 1608 Schütz entered the University of Marburg to study law, but in 1609 he went to Venice, where for three years he studied music at the landgrave’s expense; his chief teacher there was Giovanni Gabrieli. In Venice Schütz wrote his first known works, a set of Italian madrigals for five voices (published 1611). In 1613 he returned to Germany and went to Leipzig to resume his legal studies. Shortly afterward the landgrave offered him the post of second organist at the court in Kassel. In 1614 he went to Dresden to supervise the music for the christening of the son of the elector of Saxony, and in 1617 the landgrave gave him a permanent post in the electoral chapel. In 1628 Schütz again visited Venice, where Claudio Monteverdi was now the chief musical figure; it is possible that Schütz studied with him. Three years after his return to Dresden, Schütz left the elector’s court, which was being seriously affected by plague and by the turmoils of the Thirty Years’ War. From 1633 to 1635 he was chapelmaster to the royal court of Copenhagen. From 1635, apart from one further visit to the Danish court, he remained, in spite of his frequent pleas for dismissal, in the elector’s service at Dresden.
