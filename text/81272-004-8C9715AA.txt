Merychippus, extinct genus of early horses, found as fossils in deposits from the Middle and Late Miocene Epoch (16.4 to 5.3 million years ago). Merychippus descended from the earlier genus Parahippus.
The tooth pattern in Merychippus is basically the same as that in the modern horse; the teeth became higher and dental cement appeared, which allowed a grazing mode of life. Other developments in the skeleton are also evident: its size increased so that Merychippus was almost as large as a modern pony, and the skull became more elongated in a very horselike fashion. The limbs as well became more horselike in proportion and better adapted to running. In some forms the three toes remained comparatively large, but in progressive species of Merychippus the two side toes were short and small. The centre toe was much larger than the others and carried most of the animalâ€™s weight. A well-developed hoof was present on the large central toe.
