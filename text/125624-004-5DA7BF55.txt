Cricket frog, either of two species of small, nonclimbing North American tree frogs of the genus Acris (family Hylidae). Their call is a series of rapid clicks, sounding much like the song of crickets. They occur in the eastern and central United States, usually along the open, grassy margin of ponds, streams, and other shallow bodies of water. There are two species: A. crepitans and A. gryllus. The cricket frog attains a maximum length of about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches). Its skin is slightly warty and brown or green, with a dark triangle on the head and usually a reddish, whitish, or green stripe along the back.
