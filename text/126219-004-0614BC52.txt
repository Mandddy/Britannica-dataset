Baily’s beads, arc of bright spots seen during total and annular eclipses of the Sun. They are named for Francis Baily, an English astronomer, who called attention to them after seeing them during an annular eclipse on May 15, 1836. Just before the Moon’s disk covers the Sun, the narrow crescent of sunlight may be broken in several places by irregularities (mountains and valleys) on the edge of the Moon’s disk; the resulting array of spots roughly resembles a string of beads.
