Cissus,  genus of about 350 species of tropical and subtropical, chiefly woody vines of the grape family (Vitaceae). The leaves are often fleshy and somewhat succulent. The species C. incisa, commonly known as ivy treebine, marine ivy, or grape ivy, is native to the southern and south-central United States. It grows up to 9 m (30 feet) long and has compound leaves with three leaflets. The black fruit is about 2 cm (0.78 inch) in diameter. C. sicyoides, known as waterwithe treebine or princess vine, is native from southern Florida to tropical America and is especially noted for its abundance of long, slender aerial roots.
C. rhombifolia, often called grape ivy, and C. antarctica, also known as kangaroo vine, are often grown as indoor vines.
