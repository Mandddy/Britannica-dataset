Mauryan empire, in ancient India, a state centred at Pataliputra (later Patna) near the junction of the Son and Ganges (Ganga) rivers. It lasted from about 321 to 185 bce.
In the wake of the death of Alexander the Great in 323 bce, Chandragupta (or Chandragupta Maurya), founder of the Mauryan dynasty, carved out the majority of an empire that encompassed most of the Indian subcontinent, except for the Tamil-speaking south. The Mauryan empire was an efficient and highly organized autocracy with a standing army and civil service. That bureaucracy and its operation were the model for the Artha-shastra (“The Science of Material Gain”), a work of political economy similar in tone and scope to Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince.
