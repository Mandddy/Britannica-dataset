Deimos, the outer and smaller of Mars’s two moons. It was discovered telescopically with its companion moon, Phobos, by the American astronomer Asaph Hall in 1877 and named for one of the sons of Ares, the Greek counterpart of the Roman god Mars. Deimos is an irregular rocky object having a cratered surface covered with a thick layer of fine debris.
Roughly ellipsoidal in shape, Deimos measures about 15 km (9 miles) in its longest dimension. It revolves once around Mars every 30 hours 17 minutes at a mean distance of 23,458 km (14,576 miles) in a circular orbit that lies within 2° of Mars’s equatorial plane. The satellite’s long axis is always directed toward Mars; as with Earth’s Moon, it has a rotational period equal to its orbital period and so keeps the same face to the planet.
