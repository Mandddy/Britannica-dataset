Louisville, largest city in Kentucky, U.S., and the seat of Jefferson county, opposite the Falls of the Ohio River. Louisville is the centre of a metropolitan area including Jefferson county in Kentucky and Clark and Floyd counties in Indiana. Bridges spanning the Ohio link the city with New Albany and Jeffersonville, Indiana. Following a referendum passed in 2000, the city and Jefferson county merged in 2003, thereby more than doubling the cityâ€™s population and increasing its area more than sixfold.
The first recorded visit to the area by Europeans was on July 8, 1773, when Captain Thomas Bullitt arrived to survey the lands with a commission from the governor of Virginia. During the American Revolution, a group of settlers accompanying the American officer George Rogers Clark settled (May 1778) on Corn Island (since swept away by floods) opposite Beargrass Creek, where Clark organized a base for the conquest of the British-held Old Northwest. Most of the settlers who came with him moved ashore the following winter and established Fort-on-Shore (Fort Nelson) within the present city limits. The town was organized in 1779 and named for Louis XVI of France; it was incorporated as a town the following year.
