Friedrich Dahlmann, in full Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann  (born May 13, 1785, Wismar, Swedish-held city in Mecklenburg [Germany]—died  December 5, 1860, Bonn) prominent liberal historian and advocate of German unification along Kleindeutsch (“Little German,” or anti-Austrian) lines, who played a major role in creating the draft constitution of 1848 that attempted unsuccessfully to unite Germany as a constitutional monarchy.
Dahlmann was appointed professor of history at the University of Kiel in Schleswig (1812), and in 1829 he moved to the University of Göttingen, where he helped draft the liberal Hanoverian constitution of 1833. When King Ernest Augustus repudiated the Hanover constitution in 1837, Dahlmann led a famous protest of seven Göttingen professors that aroused great popular sympathy in Germany. Dismissed and banished from Hanover, he spent some years in Leipzig and Jena. He was appointed to the faculty at the University of Bonn by Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1842, and there he wrote several works in which he expressed his preference for the British form of government.
