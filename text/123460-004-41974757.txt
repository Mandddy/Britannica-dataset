Goiás, formerly Goyaz,  estado (state), south-central Brazil. Goiás is the site of the Distrito Federal (Federal District) and national capital, Brasília. It is bounded by the states of Tocantins on the north, Bahia and Minas Gerais on the east, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul on the south, and Mato Grosso on the west. The state capital, since 1937, has been Goiânia.
The first European penetration of this interior part of Brazil was carried on by expeditions from São Paulo in the 17th century. Gold was discovered in the stream gravels of a tributary of the Araguaia River by the explorer Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva in 1682. The settlement he founded there, called Santa Anna, became the colonial town of Goiás, the former state capital. In 1744 the large inland area, much of it still unexplored by Europeans, was made a captaincy general, and in 1822 it became a province of the empire of Brazil. It became a state in 1889. The Brazilian constitution of 1891 specified that the nation’s capital should be moved to the Brazilian Highlands (Planalto Central), and in 1956 Goiás was selected as the site for the Federal District and capital city, Brasília. The seat of the federal government was officially moved to Brasília in 1960. In 1989 the northern third of Goiás became a separate state called Tocantins.
