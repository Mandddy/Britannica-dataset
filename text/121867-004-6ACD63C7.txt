Su Shi, Wade-Giles romanization Su Shih, courtesy name (zi) Zizhan, literary name (hao) Dongpo Jushi, also called Su Dongpo  (born January 8, 1037, Meishan [now in Sichuan province], China—died August 24, 1101, Changzhou, Jiangsu province) one of China’s greatest poets and essayists, who was also an accomplished calligrapher and a public official.
A member of a literary family, the young Su Shi performed brilliantly in his official examinations and was rewarded with the first of the many official positions he occupied during his long and distinguished career. While Su was popular with the people of the various provinces in which he industriously served, he sometimes encountered criticism from the frequently changing heads of state. Wang Anshi, prime minister under the Song emperor Shenzong and an accomplished poet himself, banished Su to Huangzhou, Hubei province, in 1079, because of Su’s opposition to some of Wang’s radical reform measures. Despite his five-year banishment, Su remained friendly toward Wang, later exchanging poems with him. He demonstrated this same optimism and lack of bitterness when he was banished by other forces to Hainan Island in 1094. Shortly before his death he was allowed to return to the mainland and was restored to favour and office.
