Charles Hermite,  (born Dec. 24, 1822, Dieuze, Fr.—died  Jan. 14, 1901, Paris) French mathematician whose work in the theory of functions includes the application of elliptic functions to provide the first solution to the general equation of the fifth degree, the quintic equation.
Although Hermite had proved himself a creative mathematician at the age of 20, his difficulty in passing his formal examinations forced him to devote five of his most productive years to preparing for his examination for the bachelor of science degree, which he obtained in 1848. He was given a minor teaching position at the École Polytechnique, Paris, before being appointed to the Collège de France, Paris, in the same year. It was not until 1869, with his appointment as professor at the École Normale, Paris, that he attained a position commensurate with his ability. In 1870 he became professor of higher algebra at the Sorbonne.
