Maryse Condé, originally Maryse Boucolon   (born Feb. 11, 1934, Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, French West Indies) Guadeloupian author of epic historical fiction, much of it based in Africa.
Condé wrote her first novel at the age of 11. In the politically turbulent years between 1960 and 1968, she taught in Guinea, Ghana, and Senegal. She studied at the Sorbonne in Paris (M.A., Ph.D., 1975). Her own peripatetic life provided the background for her novel Hérémakhonon (1976), about a young West Indian woman’s quest for roots. Un Saison à Rihata (1981; A Season in Rihata) is set in a late 20th-century African land. Her major work is the best-selling two-volume novel Ségou (1984; Segu) and Ségou II (1985; The Children of Segu). Set in historic Segou, now part of Mali, it examines the violent impact of the slave trade, Islam, Christianity, and white colonization on a royal family during the period from 1797 to 1860. Moi, Tituba, sorcière noire de Salem (1986; I, Tituba, Black Witch of Salem) is based on the story of an American slave who was tried for witchcraft in Salem, Massachusetts. In 1986 Condé returned to live in Guadeloupe, where La Vie scélérate (1987; Tree of Life) is set. Her later fiction includes La Colonie du nouveau monde (1993), La Migration des coeurs (1995; Windward Heights), and Desirada (1997; Desirada), and she has also written plays, children’s books, and essays on literature and politics.
