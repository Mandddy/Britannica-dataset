Marsyas,  legendary Greek figure of Anatolian origin. According to the usual Greek version, Marsyas found the aulos (double pipe) that the goddess Athena had invented and thrown away and, after becoming skilled in playing it, challenged Apollo to a contest with his lyre. The victory was awarded to Apollo, who tied Marsyas to a tree and flayed him. His skin was displayed at Calaenae in southern Phrygia, as the Greek historians Herodotus and Xenophon report. According to the 2nd-century-ad Greek writer Hyginus, King Midas of Phrygia was given assesâ€™ ears by Apollo when he voted for Marsyas. A common version of the story tells of a similar musical contest between Apollo and Pan. In Rome a statue of Marsyas, a favourite art subject, stood in the Forum; this was imitated by Roman colonies and came to be considered a symbol of autonomy.
