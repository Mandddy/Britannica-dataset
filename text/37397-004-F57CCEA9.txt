Stringer Lawrence,  (born March 6, 1697, Hereford, Herefordshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 10, 1775, London) British army captain whose transformation of irregular troops into an effective fighting force earned him credit as the real founder of the Indian army under British rule.
During 20 years of army service, Lawrence rose from ensign to captain and served at Gibraltar, in Flanders (Belgium), and at the Battle of Culloden (1746; Inverness, Scot.). He joined the East India Company early in 1748 and commanded company troops at Madras (Chennai). He so trained his mixed force of Europeans, topasses (Christian Indo-Portuguese), and sepoys (Indian soldiers in British employ) that by June 1748 he was able to foil a French attack on Cuddalore; he was captured by the French, however, and released after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle (1748). In the capture of Devakottai in 1749, his subordinate officer was Robert (afterward Lord) Clive, who eventually became a lifelong friend. In 1750 Lawrence resigned from service to the British government over a pay dispute and dissatisfaction with the company’s management. Lawrence left for England shortly thereafter, but the company’s directors called on him just a few months later to be the commander in chief of their military forces in the East Indies.
