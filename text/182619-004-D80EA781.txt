Bush honeysuckle (genus Diervilla), genus of three species of low shrubs belonging to the family Caprifoliaceae (formerly Diervillaceae), native to eastern North America. They are frequently confused with the closely related Tatarian honeysuckle (Lonicera tatarica) and other cultivated members of the genus Lonicera, which are invasive species in many parts of the United States (see honeysuckle). Diervilla species are attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds and are commonly used in native landscaping.
Bush honeysuckles are deciduous perennials and have oval leaves and clusters of tubular flowers at the branch tips. They spread by rhizomes (underground stems) and form patches in rocky dry areas. Flowering occurs in early summer. The yellow or reddish yellow blooms are followed by slender beaked fruits. The northern bush honeysuckle (D. lonicera) and the mountain bush honeysuckle (D. rivularis) are similar except for the smaller size and more-pointed leaves of D. lonicera. The southern bush honeysuckle (D. sessilifolia) has stalkless leaves and angled branches.
