Racerunner (genus Cnemidophorus), also called whiptail,  any of about 56 species of lizards in the family Teiidae. The genus is common in North America, particularly in the southwestern deserts, and its range extends through Central America and across South America to Argentina. Species also occur on some islands, including the Lesser Antilles off the coast of Venezuela. Their size varies from 20 to more than 50 cm (8 to 20 inches). The common name of this genus is derived from the lizards’ ability to run at impressive speeds; some species can run almost 28 km (17 miles) per hour over short distances.
Racerunners vary considerably in coloration and pattern, even within a species. Some possess yellow stripes, spots, or both on a brown or black background, whereas others are nearly black. They generally prefer open habitats where direct exposure to the sun is available, and many inhabit deserts. Forest species are found in clearings and on open trails where sun exposure is high. Most species eat insects and spiders, although several species on islands feed mostly on plants. Racerunners are highly active lizards that search widely for prey, using their tongues to sample chemicals in the environment and a highly sensitive organ to discriminate prey based on chemical cues (see Jacobson’s organ). All are wary, tend to maintain a safe distance from observers, and run to shelter when pursued. The genus is of great interest to biologists because of the existence of sexual as well as parthenogenetic species and because of species that have three and four sets of chromosomes, rather than the usual two.
