Tango, ballroom dance, musical style, and song. The tango evolved about 1880 in dance halls and perhaps brothels in the lower-class districts of Buenos Aires, where the Spanish tango, a light-spirited variety of flamenco, merged with the milonga, a fast, sensual, and disreputable Argentine dance; it also shows possible influences from the Cuban habanera. In the early 1900s the tango became socially acceptable and by 1915 was a craze in fashionable European circles. The first tango music by known composers was published in 1910.
The early tangos were spirited and lively, but by 1920 the music and lyrics had become intensely melancholy. The tango step likewise evolved from early exuberance to a smoother ballroom step, and the prevailing duple metre (2/4) into 4/4, 4/8, or other tempo.
