Pepsin, the powerful enzyme in gastric juice that digests proteins such as those in meat, eggs, seeds, or dairy products.
Pepsin was first recognized in 1836 by the German physiologist Theodor Schwann. In 1929 its crystallization and protein nature were reported by American biochemist John Howard Northrop of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. (Northrop later received a share of the 1946 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work in successfully purifying and crystallizing enzymes.)
