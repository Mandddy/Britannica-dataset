Cecil B. DeMille, in full Cecil Blount DeMille   (born August 12, 1881, Ashfield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died January 21, 1959, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California) American motion-picture producer-director whose use of spectacle attracted vast audiences and made him a dominant figure in Hollywood for almost five decades.
Long before he made his first sound picture, DeMille had become a cinema legend for his efforts in the development of silent movies from shorts to feature-length productions and in helping to establish Hollywood as the new centre of the filmmaking industry. Unlike such other great directors of the silents as D.W. Griffith and Mack Sennett, DeMille easily made the transition to sound pictures, continuing to be productive—and profitable—well into the 1950s.
