Trichinosis, also called trichinellosis or trichiniasis,  disorder resulting from infestation with the small roundworm Trichinella spiralis, commonly acquired by humans by the eating of undercooked pork containing encapsulated larvae of the parasite.
In the stomach and small intestine, the capsular coating is digested, and the liberated larvae invade the mucosal lining of the small intestine, becoming adults within a week. After fertilization the female worm deposits larvae into the mucosa and sometimes directly into the lymph vessels, from which the larvae reach the blood and are carried to all parts of the body, notably the burrows of skeletal muscles, where they reach the encapsulation stage. The muscles most often invaded are those of the diaphragm, eyes, neck, throat, larynx, and tongue. The larval capsules, or cysts, may remain alive in the muscles for years, eventually becoming calcified. Unless the muscle of the host animal is eaten by another animal, the trichinella dies in the cyst and the cyst calcifies. If the host animal is eaten, the cycle begins again.
