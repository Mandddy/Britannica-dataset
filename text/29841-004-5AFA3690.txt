Michel Bibaud,  (born Jan. 19, 1782, Côte des Neiges, near Montreal [Quebec, Can.]—died  Aug. 3, 1857, Montreal) author of French Canada’s first volume of poetry and of a pioneering history of French Canada.
Educated at the Collège Saint-Raphael, Bibaud became a schoolteacher and journalist. He wrote an arithmetic textbook and edited periodicals, of which La Bibliothèque canadienne, containing his own historical writing, was the best known. His most important historical work, Histoire du Canada, sous la domination française (1837), was the first history of French Canada written by a French Canadian. It covers the period from the founding of Canada to 1731; a second volume (1844) brings the story to 1830. (A third volume, treating events from 1830 to 1837, was published by his son in 1878.)
