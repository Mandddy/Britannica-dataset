Deborah Kerr, original name Deborah Jane Kerr-Trimmer  (born September 30, 1921, Helensburgh, Dunbartonshire, Scotland—died October 16, 2007, Suffolk, England) British motion-picture and theatre actress known for the poise and serenity she exhibited in portraying complex characters. Kerr is one of the great British actresses to have made a significant contribution to American films.
Kerr trained as a dancer in her aunt’s drama school in Bristol, England. She won a scholarship to Sadler’s Wells ballet school and at age 17 made her professional dancing debut in London in the corps de ballet of Prometheus. Discovering an interest in acting, Kerr began playing bit parts in various Shakespeare productions. In 1941 she made her British film debut in a supporting role as a Salvation Army volunteer in the film adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s Major Barbara. She developed her acting skills enough to be hired as a leading lady and portrayed the major role of Sister Clodagh in Black Narcissus (1947), for which she won her first New York Film Critics’ Circle Award (her subsequent awards were for Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison [1957] and The Sundowners [1960]). Black Narcissus became an international hit and led to an MGM contract and the opportunity to play opposite Clark Gable in The Hucksters later that year.
