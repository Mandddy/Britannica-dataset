Yarmūk River, Arabic Nahr Al-Yarmūk, Hebrew Nahar Ha-Yarmuk ,  river, a tributary of the Jordan River, in southwest Asia. For most of its course, the Yarmūk forms the boundary between Syria to the north and Jordan to the south, while near its junction with the Jordan it forms the boundary between Israel and Jordan. After the Six-Day War of June 1967, the lower 14 miles (23 km) of the river formed the boundary between Jordan and Israeli-held territory, including both the occupied Golan Heights and Israel proper.
The Yarmūk rises on a lava plateau in southwest Syria, near the Jordan frontier, and flows roughly southwestward to its confluence with the Jordan River. The Yarmūk is only 20 miles (32 km) long in a straight line, but because of the many convolutions in its course, the total length of the stream is about 50 miles (80 km). The river has cut through the resistant lava of the plateau to soft, chalky limestone beneath, creating a steep-walled gorge. The river basin has a warm, semiarid climate. In January, temperatures average above 41 °F (5 °C). In the summer months, temperatures may exceed 86 °F (30 °C). Rain falls mainly between October and March. The vegetation in this region is dominated by short grasses and drought-resistant scrub.
