Comédie-Italienne, the Italian commedia dell’arte as it was called in France. The name was used in France after 1680 to distinguish the commedia dell’arte from native French drama produced at the Comédie-Française. Italian commedia dell’arte companies appeared in France from the 16th century and pleased both the courtiers, who understood Italian, and the populace, which enjoyed the improvised antics, dialogue, and pantomime. In 1697, however, their satire was found offensive, and the companies were banished from France.
Prior to 1697 the Comédie-Italienne, at the urging of the French audiences, had increasingly interspersed French words, phrases, and sometimes whole scenes into productions. A leader of one company, Giuseppe Domenico Biancolelli, known as Dominique, eventually received official sanction from Louis XIV to use French, and thereafter the Comédie-Italienne became a new market for French dramatists.
