Mount of Olives, Arabic Jabal Al-Ṭūr, Hebrew Har ha-Zetim,  multisummited limestone ridge just east of the Old City of Jerusalem and separated from it by the Kidron valley. Frequently mentioned in the Bible and later religious literature, it is holy both to Judaism and to Christianity. Politically, it is part of the municipality of Greater Jerusalem placed under direct Israeli administration following the Six-Day War of 1967; it is not part of the West Bank (Judaea and Samaria) territory.
The peak usually regarded as the Mount of Olives proper is the southern summit, 2,652 feet (808 metres) above sea level. The middle peak (2,645 feet [806 metres]) is crowned by the Augusta Victoria Hospital. At the north is the highest peak, commonly called Mount Scopus (Hebrew: Har ha-Ẕofim; Arabic: Rʾas al-Mashārif; 2,694 feet [820 metres]).
