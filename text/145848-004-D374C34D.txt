Materials handling, the movement of raw goods from their native site to the point of use in manufacturing, their subsequent manipulation in production processes, and the transfer of finished products from factories and their distribution to users or sales outlets.
In early systems of handling materials, goods were handled as single units in a discontinuous manner. These early methods treated the three basic stages of handling—materials collection, manufacturing, and product distribution—as discrete steps, and materials were moved in individual rather than bulk units.
