River Nen, also spelled Nene,  river rising in the East Midlands, England, flowing 90 miles (145 km) from limestone uplands in a generally northeastward course to The Wash, a shallow North Sea inlet. It flows past Northampton and Oundle to Peterborough in a broad valley. Thence its course is almost level for 30 miles (50 km) across the Fens (a drained area) past Wisbech into The Wash. The river has locks as far as Northampton. Several of its upper tributaries have been dammed to form small reservoirs for urban water supply.
