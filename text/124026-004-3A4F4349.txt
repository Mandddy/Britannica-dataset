The university’s history began in 1846 with the establishment of National Male and Female seminaries by the Cherokee National Council, as specified by a provision of a treaty between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation. The two schools opened in 1851. In 1909 the state of Oklahoma bought the female seminary and established Northeastern State Normal School there to provide high school instruction and two years of college education. It became a four-year, degree-granting institution in 1919, when it was renamed Northeastern State Teachers College. It was elevated to university standing in 1974 and given its current name in 1985.
