Wild West show, theatrical extravaganza begun in 1883 by William Frederick “Buffalo Bill” Cody. Cody, an Indian scout and Western hero, first turned to acting and then to producing and promoting his own Wild West show. In 1887 his show was performed at Madison Square Garden, New York City, with a cast of 100 Indians; Annie Oakley, the sharpshooter; other trick riders, ropers, and shooters; and such wild animals as buffalo, elk, bear, moose, and deer.
The four-hour spectacle, including Indian war dances and an “attack” on a stagecoach, went on to tour England and Europe with such success that Queen Victoria saw the show three times.
