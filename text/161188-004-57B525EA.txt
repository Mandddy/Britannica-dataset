José Bento Monteiro Lobato,  (born April 18, 1882, Taubaté, Brazil—died July 4, 1948, São Paulo) writer and publisher, forerunner of the Modernist movement in Brazilian literature.
Originally a lawyer and coffee planter in the interior of São Paulo state, Monteiro Lobato wrote an unpretentious letter to a São Paulo newspaper, describing the droughts and brushfires in the interior. The editor asked for more articles and Lobato replied with the sketches and short stories, later collected in his book Urupês (1918; “Mushrooms”). In these he introduced the character Jeca Tatu (“Joe Armadillo”), who became the symbol of the Brazilian backlander. “Poor Jeca Tatu,” Lobato comments. “You are so handsome in novels and so ugly in real life! You don’t talk; you don’t sing; you don’t love.”
