The Day the Earth Stood Still, American science-fiction film, released in 1951, that is considered a classic of the genre and that reflects the fears and anxiety of the Cold War era and nascent atomic age.
A flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C., carrying Klaatu (played by Michael Rennie) and his robot servant Gort (Lock Martin). Klaatu is shot shortly after landing and is taken to an army hospital. Klaatu tells the president’s secretary that he wants to meet the leaders of Earth but soon is told that an agreement on a meeting site has proved impossible to obtain. Klaatu subsequently escapes from the hospital and takes a room in a boarding house, where he befriends a young widow, Helen Benson (Patricia Neal), and her son, Bobby (Billy Gray). With Bobby’s help, Klaatu meets the eminent scientist Professor Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe) and reveals that he is a representative from a federation of other planets sent to Earth to warn humankind that their experiments with atomic weapons are threatening the safety of other civilizations. After Barnhardt tells Klaatu that he needs to demonstrate his power to Earth’s leaders, Klaatu arranges for the loss of all power on Earth except where such loss would be life-threatening. Realizing that he is the alien visitor, Helen helps Klaatu get back to his saucer. Before leaving, Klaatu warns Barnhardt and his fellow scientists that unless humankind gives up violence, other planets will destroy Earth in their own defense.
