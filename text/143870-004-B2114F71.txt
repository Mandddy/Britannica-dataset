Laccolith,  in geology, any of a type of igneous intrusion that has split apart two strata, resulting in a domelike structure; the floor of the structure is usually horizontal. A laccolith is often smaller than a stock, which is another type of igneous intrusion, and usually is less than 16 km (10 miles) in diameter; the thickness of laccoliths ranges from hundreds of metres to a few thousand metres. They can be contrasted with sills, which are sheetlike intrusions oriented parallel to the bedding of the enclosing rock: a laccolithâ€™s ratio of diameter to thickness should be less than 10; a larger ratio would make the body a sill. Acidic rocks are more common than basic rocks in laccoliths. Although the lower portions of laccoliths are seldom visible, they usually are interpreted as having a relatively small feeder from a magma source below. A well-known example of a laccolith is found in the Henry Mountains, Utah.
