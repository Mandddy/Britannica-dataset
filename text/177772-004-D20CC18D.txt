Simon Willard,  (born April 3, 1753, Grafton, Massachusetts, U.S.—died August 30, 1848, Roxbury, Massachusetts) famous American clock maker. Willard was the creator of the timepiece that came to be known as the banjo clock, and he was the most celebrated of a family of Massachusetts clock makers who designed and produced brass-movement clocks between 1765 and 1850.
About 1780 Willard moved from Grafton, where he had been apprenticed to a clock maker, and settled in Roxbury, near Boston, where he continued studies with his brother Benjamin (1743–1803). Simon Willard worked in Roxbury until his retirement in 1839. He catered to a wealthy clientele, including Thomas Jefferson, who commissioned a clock for the University of Virginia. Willard made various types of clocks but specialized in pieces for churches, halls, and galleries. It is believed that he concentrated on producing accurate, simple movements and that the cases for his clocks were made by others.
