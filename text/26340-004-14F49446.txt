Selim III,  (born Dec. 24, 1761, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died July 29, 1808, Constantinople) Ottoman sultan from 1789 to 1807, who undertook a program of Westernization and whose reign felt the intellectual and political ferment created by the French Revolution.
A poet and an accomplished composer of Ottoman classical music, Selim had enjoyed greater freedom prior to his accession than the Ottoman princes before him. Influenced by his father, Mustafa III (reigned 1757–74), Selim had acquired a zeal for reform.
