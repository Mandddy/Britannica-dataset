Naktong River, Korean Naktong-gang,  river, in the Yŏngnam area of the provinces (do) of North Kyŏngsang and South Kyŏngsang, southeastern South Korea. Korea’s second longest river (325 miles [523 km]), it flows generally southward from the T’aebaek Mountains and enters the Korean Strait at Tadae-p’o, a suburb of Pusan. The river is navigable for 215 miles (350 km), from its mouth to Andong in North Kyŏngsang province. With its principal tributaries, the Naesŏng, Panbyŏn, Wi, Kŭmho, and Nam, the river has a drainage basin of 9,200 square miles (23,800 square km). Flowing slowly over old hilly districts, the Naktong River has formed a fertile delta plain along Chin Bay; including the plain, approximately one-fourth of the river’s basin is used for the cultivation of crops. The river also supplies water for use in the cities along its course. The Nam River, which flows in the central part of South Kyŏngsang province, has a multipurpose dam near Chinju that was constructed in 1968. During the opening phase of the Korean War (1950–53), the middle Naktong River constituted part of the last line of defense for the South Korean and American forces that had temporarily retreated to the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula.
