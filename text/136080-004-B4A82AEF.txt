XMM-Newton, European Space Agency (ESA) satellite that observes celestial X-ray sources. It was launched in 1999 and was named after English physicist Isaac Newton.
XMM-Newton is the largest European science satellite. It is 10 metres (33 feet) long; its solar arrays span 16 metres (52 feet); and it weighs 3.8 metric tons. It was launched on December 10, 1999, from Kourou, French Guiana, by an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. The satellite orbits Earth every 48 hours and is in an eccentric orbit (perigee of 7,000 km [4,000 miles] and apogee of 114,000 km [71,000 miles]) that allows long observations of astronomical objects.
