William Crapo Durant,  (born Dec. 8, 1861, Bostonâ€”died March 18, 1947, New York City) American industrialist and founder of General Motors Corporation, which later became one of the largest corporations in the world in terms of sales.
After establishing a carriage company in Michigan in 1886, Durant took over a small firm in 1903 and began to manufacture Buick motorcars. He brought together several automotive manufacturers to form the General Motors Company in 1908, but financial problems cost him control of the company in 1910. With Louis Chevrolet, however, he established the Chevrolet Motor Company, which acquired control of General Motors in 1915. From that base, Durant, as president, created the General Motors Corporation and launched a successful expansion program. Post-World War I difficulties again forced him out of General Motors in 1920, and he formed a new firm, Durant Motors, Inc., in 1921. This and later ventures, some of which were large, were generally unsuccessful.
