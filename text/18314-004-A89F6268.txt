Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Carl also spelled Karl  (born Dec. 9, 1742, Stralsund, Pomerania [now in Ger.]—died May 21, 1786, Köping, Swed.) German Swedish chemist who independently discovered oxygen, chlorine, and manganese.
Scheele, the son of a German merchant, was born in a part of Germany that was under Swedish jurisdiction. In 1757 Scheele was apprenticed to a pharmacist in Gothenburg, Swed. His interest in chemistry arose during his apprenticeship, and he read extensively and experimented frequently with the large variety of chemicals available to him. In 1765 he finished his apprenticeship and moved to Malmö, Swed., to work at a pharmacy. In Malmö he made his first contacts with the academic world through the Swedish anatomist Anders Jahan Retzius at Lund University.
