Teda, also called Toda, Todaga, Todga, Tuda, or Tudaga,  people of the eastern and central Sahara (Chad, Niger, and Libya). Their language, also called Teda (or Tedaga), is closely related to the Kanuri and Zaghawa languages, and it belongs to the Saharan group of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Teda has northern and southern groups; the term Teda is sometimes used for the northern grouping only, with Daza (Dasa) used especially in French literature as the term for the southern group.
The Teda live either as nomadic herdsmen or as farmers near oases. Dates are a staple crop, and a variety of grains, legumes, and roots also are cultivated. Cattle, goats, donkeys, camels, and sheep are kept, and caravan trade is an important factor in the economy. Sedentary Teda villagers typically live in palm-thatched, rectangular mud houses or cylindrical huts of mud or stone with conical thatch.
