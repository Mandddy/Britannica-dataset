Vesta, second largest—and the brightest—asteroid of the asteroid belt and the fourth such object to be discovered, by the German astronomer and physician Wilhelm Olbers on March 29, 1807. It is named for the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth (the Greek Hestia).
Vesta revolves around the Sun once in 3.63 years in a nearly circular moderately inclined (7.1°) orbit at a mean distance of 2.36 astronomical units (AU; about 353 million km [219 million miles]). It has an ellipsoidal shape with radial dimensions of 286 × 279 × 223 km (178 × 173 × 139 miles), equivalent to a sphere with a diameter of 526 km (327 miles)—i.e., about 15 percent of the diameter of Earth’s Moon. Although Vesta is only about half the size of the largest asteroid, the dwarf planet Ceres, it is about four times as reflective (Vesta’s albedo, averaged over its rotation, is 0.40, compared with 0.10 for Ceres), and it orbits closer (Ceres’s mean distance is 2.77 AU). Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid visible to the unaided eye. Its mass is about 2.6 × 1020 kg, and its density is 3.46 grams per cubic cm (about the same as that of the Moon). It rotates once in 5.3 hours.
