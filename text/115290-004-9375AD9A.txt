Fraser River, major river of western North America, draining a huge, scenic region of some 92,000 square miles (238,000 square km) in central British Columbia. About 70 percent of the region drained is over 3,000 feet (900 m) high, and human exploitation of this rather isolated area has been relatively recent. The natural beauties of the river course (particularly its spectacular canyon section) and the surrounding countryside have nevertheless remained relatively unspoiled. The river was named for Simon Fraser, who first descended it to the Pacific Ocean in 1808. The Cariboo gold rush, which began in 1858, took place in the Fraser River basin.
From its source in Yellowhead Lake on the British Columbia–Alberta border, the Fraser flows 851 miles (1,370 km) to its mouth on the Strait of Georgia. From its mountain source, the river’s course is initially northwestward, descending by gentle gradients along the Rocky Mountain trench. Near latitude 54° N the river makes a great bend southward to traverse the Interior Plateau and then the Coast Mountains. Entrenchment and gradients increase progressively downstream, and through the Coast Mountains the raging waters traverse a canyon about 5,000 feet (1,500 m) deep. Below this canyon the Fraser turns westward to flow placidly across an alluvial plain to its debouchment near Vancouver, B.C. The Thompson River, which enters the Fraser about 145 miles (235 km) from its mouth, is the most important of numerous tributaries, many of which rise in extensive mountain lakes. Navigation is important only in the tidal estuary where New Westminster serves deep-sea ships.
