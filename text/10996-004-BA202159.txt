Andreas Hofer,  (born Nov. 22, 1767, near Sankt Leonhard, South Tirol, Austrian Empire [now San Leonardo, Italy]—died  Feb. 20, 1810, Mantua, Kingdom of Italy) Tirolese patriot, military leader, and popular hero who fought Napoleonic France and Bavaria for two years (1809–10) in an attempt to keep his homeland under Austrian rule.
Hofer was an innkeeper, wine merchant, and cattle dealer and was intensely loyal to the Austrian house of Habsburg and the Roman Catholic church. He worked for the return of the Tirol to Austria after it had been ceded to Bavaria in 1805. With Austrian aid, he fought a number of successful minor actions against the Bavarian and Italo-French troops occupying his homeland, becoming well known throughout the Tirol.
