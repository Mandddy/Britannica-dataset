Monaghan, Irish Muineachán (“Place of Thickets”),  one of the three counties of Ireland forming part of the historic province of Ulster that now projects northward into Northern Ireland. Most of the county’s northern boundary winds through cultivated lowlands except on Slieve Beagh, a desolate upland rising to 1,221 feet (372 metres). For many miles the boundary with Northern Ireland runs along the River Blackwater. Monaghan, in the north-central part of the county, is the county town (seat). Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Clones, and Monaghan are urban districts.
Three main regions may be distinguished: the Slieve Beagh plateau in the north; the lowland Monaghan corridor from the valley of the River Erne to the Lough (Lake) Neagh basin, an important route; and, to the south, the Silurian hill country rising to more than 1,000 feet (300 metres). The landscape of the northern plateau and lowland corridor is dominated by drumlins, long oval mounds that give the lowland corridor a highly complicated drainage pattern. There are numerous small lakes and peat flats, the relics of former lakes and ponds. Similar drumlins and waters are found in the Silurian hill country.
