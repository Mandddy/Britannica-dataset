Ian Thorpe,  (born October 13, 1982, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia) Australian athlete, who was the most successful swimmer in that country’s history, accumulating five Olympic gold medals and 11 world championship titles between 1998 and 2004.
Thorpe began swimming competitively at age eight, and, although he had been uncoordinated in other sports, he excelled in the pool. At age 13 he broke 10 national age-group records in one meet, and the following year he became the youngest swimmer to make Australia’s national team. At the 1998 world championships, Thorpe, then age 15, became the youngest world swimming champion with his world-record victory in the 400-metre freestyle. Aided by his height (6 feet 4 inches [2 metres]) and extraordinarily large feet, which some compared to flippers, Thorpe soon became known as the “Thorpedo.”
