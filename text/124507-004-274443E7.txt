Heliosphere, the region surrounding the Sun and the solar system that is filled with the solar magnetic field and the protons and electrons of the solar wind.
The solar magnetic field in the heliosphere has a dipole structure. The magnetic field lines that are carried outward from the Sun by the solar wind remain attached to the Sun’s surface. Because of the Sun’s rotation, the lines are drawn into a spiral structure. In one hemisphere (either the northern or the southern), the magnetic field lines are directed inward, and in the other they are directed outward. Between these two different hemispheres is a structure called the heliospheric current sheet.
