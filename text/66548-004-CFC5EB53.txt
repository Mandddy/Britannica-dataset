Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, née Marjorie Kinnan  (born Aug. 8, 1896, Washington, D.C., U.S.—died Dec. 14, 1953, St. Augustine, Fla.) American short-story writer and novelist who founded a regional literature of backwoods Florida.
Marjorie Kinnan’s father, who worked for the U.S. Patent Office, died when she was age 17, and she moved with her mother to Madison, Wis. One of her childhood stories had been published in The Washington Post when she was age 11, and she had won a McCall’s writing contest in 1912. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1918. The next year she married Charles A. Rawlings, a newspaperman, and worked for periods as a reporter and feature writer for the Louisville Courier-Journal and the Rochester Journal while attempting to establish a career as a writer of fiction. She managed to sell a few stories, but it was not until her sudden decision in 1928 to buy and settle on a 40-acre (16-hectare) tract of orange grove near the hamlet of Cross Creek in northern Florida that she began to find her literary voice. From her first visit to the region she had felt herself attuned to the half-wild nature of the place and to the people who lived there. Two stories sold to Scribner’s magazine and in 1933 her story “Gal Young Un” won the O. Henry Memorial Award for short stories.
