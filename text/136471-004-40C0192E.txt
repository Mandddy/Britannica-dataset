Seri, a tribe of Mesoamerican Indians who live on Tibur√≥n Island in the Gulf of California and on the adjacent mainland in Sonora. Their language seems to be related to the Yuman languages, and both are commonly assigned to the hypothetical Hokan super-stock. Early 21st-century population estimates indicate approximately 800 individuals in the tribe.
Although the Seri now engage in commercial fishing and farm labour, traditionally they lived by gathering, hunting, and fishing for such edibles as shellfish, turtles, pelicans, and cactus fruit. Their simple cane spears, hunting bows, pebble tools, and dwellings of poles and cacti earned them a reputation as being among the most primitive aboriginal groups of North America. They did, however, produce pottery, basketry, and boat-shaped rush rafts.
