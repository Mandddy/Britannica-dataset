In 1831 the Ohio Baptist Education Society founded the Granville Literary and Theological Institution. In 1845 the school became Granville College. The name was changed by 1854 to honour benefactor William S. Denison. Graduate education was made available in 1887, but in the 1920s Denison adopted a policy of undergraduate instruction exclusively. Women were first admitted to Denison in 1927, when the university merged with Shepardson College, a womenâ€™s college with which it had been affiliated since the 1860s. Since 1995, Denison has been a member (with the College of Wooster, Kenyon College, Oberlin College, and Ohio Wesleyan University) of the Five Colleges of Ohio, a consortium created to consolidate library holdings and academic resources among these small liberal arts institutions.
