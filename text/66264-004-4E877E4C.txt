Pietro Metastasio, original name Antonio Domenico Bonaventura Trapassi   (born Jan. 3, 1698, Rome—died  April 12, 1782, Vienna) Italian poet and the most celebrated librettist in Europe writing during the 18th century for the opera seria; his librettos were set more than 800 times. In 1708 his astonishing skill in verse improvisation attracted the attention of Gian Vincenzo Gravina, a man of letters who made him his heir adoptive and Hellenized his name into Pietro Metastasio.
In 1712, after receiving a good education from Gravina, Metastasio was taken to Scalea in Calabria, where he studied for some months with Gregorio Caloprese, the Cartesian philosopher. At the age of 14 he wrote Giustino, a tragedy in the Senecan style; and in 1717 he published a book of verses. In 1718 Metastasio entered the Accademia dell’Arcadia, and in 1719 he went to Naples where he was employed in a law office and gained acceptance in aristocratic circles through his voluptuous wedding poems.
