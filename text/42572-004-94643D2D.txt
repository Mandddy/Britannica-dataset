Owlet frogmouth, also called Owlet Nightjar,  any of seven or eight species of shy and solitary night birds belonging to the genus Aegotheles and comprising the family Aegothelidae. They are closely related to frogmouths, in the order Caprimulgiformes. These inhabitants of forests resemble small owls with very wide mouths nearly hidden by long bristles; they also perch like owls but have tiny feet. They eat insects, which they catch either on the wing or by pouncing from a branch. Their call is a soft churring or whistling. They lay three to five eggs in a hole in a tree or sandbank.
The best-known species is the owlet nightjar (A. cristatus)—in Australia often called the moth owl—22 cm (9 inches) long, gray above and brown below. Other species, 19–30 cm (7–12 inches) long, occur in New Guinea, New Caledonia, and the Moluccas.
