Aberdeenshire, also called Aberdeen,  council area and historic county of eastern Scotland. It projects shoulderlike eastward into the North Sea and encompasses coastal lowlands in the north and east and part of the Grampian Mountains in the west. The council area and the historic county occupy somewhat different areas. The city of Aberdeen is part of the historic county of Aberdeenshire but constitutes an independent council area that forms an enclave within the council area of Aberdeenshire. The rest of the historic county lies within the council area of the same name, which also incorporates the entire historic county of Kincardineshire and the northeastern portion of the historic county of Banffshire.
Although Aberdeenshire lies north of the Highland boundary fault, it mainly comprises an agricultural lowland drained by rivers that generally flow east. The land is in the rain shadow of the Grampians, resulting in a generally dry climate with parts of the coast receiving less than 25 inches (640 mm) of precipitation annually. Temperatures are warm for the latitude, but exposure to cold winds from the north and east produces winters that are harsh by British standards.
