George Peele,  (born c. July 25, 1556, London, England—died c. November 9, 1596) Elizabethan dramatist who experimented in many forms of theatrical art: pastoral, history, melodrama, tragedy, folk play, and pageant.
Peele’s father was a London clerk who contributed to several city pageants. Peele was educated at Oxford, where he translated into English a play by Euripides. He later moved to London, but in 1583 he returned to Oxford to supervise the performance at Christ Church of two Latin plays by the noted academic dramatist William Gager (1555–1622).
