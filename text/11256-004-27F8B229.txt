William Stewart Halsted,  (born Sept. 23, 1852, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Sept. 7, 1922, Baltimore, Md.) American pioneer of scientific surgery who established at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, the first surgical school in the United States.
After graduating in 1877 from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York City, Halsted studied for two years in Europe, mainly in Vienna, under the noted German surgeon Theodor Billroth. Returning to New York, Halsted quickly built a successful practice that demanded his services at six hospitals. In 1881, he discovered that blood, once aerated, could be reinfused into a patient’s body.
