Nora Roberts,  (born October 10, 1950, Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S.) American romance novelist who was one of the most successful and prolific authors of the genre.
As a child, Roberts was an avid reader and frequently formulated her own stories. After graduating from high school, she married and later had two sons. Confined to her home with her young children during a blizzard in 1979, she penned her first novel, Irish Thoroughbred (1981). Following that debut, Roberts enjoyed phenomenal success with dozens of enthralling romance novels. Atypical of the genre, her works did not focus on glamour and money but instead featured characters that were relatable to readers. In 1995 she began writing romance-crime novels, which were released under the pseudonym J.D. Robb; her first book in the genre was Naked in Death. Extremely prolific, Roberts followed a very disciplined schedule of writing up to eight hours, five days per week. She sometimes finished a dozen publications annually, and in 2012 she released her 200th book, The Witness. Robertsâ€™s novels were translated into more than 25 languages and consistently topped the best-seller lists. By the early 21st century, more than 400 million copies of her books were in print. Many, such as Sanctuary (1997), The Reef (1998), and Midnight Bayou (2001), were adapted as made-for-television movies.
