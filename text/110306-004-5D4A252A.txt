Jennifer Hudson, in full Jennifer Kate Hudson  (born September 12, 1981, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American actress and singer who won an Academy Award for best supporting actress for her role in Dreamgirls (2006).
Hudson began singing at age seven in her Chicago church choir. As a teenager, she performed at wedding receptions and in local talent shows and musical theatre. After graduating (1999) from Chicagoâ€™s Dunbar Vocational Career Academy, Hudson attended Langston (Oklahoma) University. In 2001 she transferred to Kennedy-King College in Chicago to study music and appeared in a local musical production of Big River. Hudson then landed her first professional singing job on a Disney cruise ship as Calliope, the head Greek muse, in a 2003 production of Hercules: The Musical. Rather than renew her contract with Disney, Hudson decided to audition for American Idol, where she reached the final rounds before being eliminated in seventh place. After fulfilling her obligation to perform with the American Idol: Season Three tour during the summer of 2004, Hudson performed at charity events on Broadway and completed a concert tour throughout the Midwest.
