Clark Gable, in full William Clark Gable   (born February 1, 1901, Cadiz, Ohio, U.S.—died  November 16, 1960, Hollywood, California) American film actor who epitomized the American ideal of masculinity and virility for three decades. An enormously popular star during his lifetime, Gable was dubbed the “King of Hollywood.”
The only son of an itinerant oil-field worker, Gable embarked on an acting career while in his early 20s and soon found himself the protégé of veteran actress Josephine Dillon, who coached Gable in poise and elocution and paid for his orthodontic work. Although several years her junior, Gable married Dillon in 1924, about the same time he began to land small roles in silent films. His first big break came when he was cast in the lead of the Broadway play Machinal (1928).
