Miyamoto Musashi, original name Miyamoto Masana, artistic name Niten  (born 1584, Mimasaka or Harima, Japan—died June 13, 1645, Higo) famous Japanese soldier-artist of the early Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603–1867).
Musashi began his career as a fighter early in life when, at age 13, he killed a man in single combat. In 1600 he was on the losing side of the Battle of Sekigahara (which paved the way for establishing the Tokugawa shogunate), becoming one of the rōnin (masterless samurai). In time he set out on a personal quest to develop perfect sword technique. He invented the nitō ichi-ryū, the style of fencing with two swords, and is often referred to today as kensai (‘‘sword saint’’). Musashi claimed to have fought in more than 60 individual sword fights, many of which were to the death and all of which he won.
