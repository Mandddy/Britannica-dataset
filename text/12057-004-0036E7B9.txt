Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga,  (born Aug. 7, 1533, Madrid, Spain—died  Nov. 29, 1594, Madrid) Spanish poet, author of La Araucana (1569–89), the most celebrated Renaissance epic poem written in Castilian.
Ercilla received a rigorous literary education before going to the New World in 1555. He distinguished himself as a soldier in Chile during the wars against the Araucanian Indians, and he based La Araucana on his experiences. He composed the whole of the poem’s first part and sections of the second and third while on the field of battle; a number of stanzas were written during breaks in the action on whatever he had at hand, including pieces of leather, some too small to contain more than six lines of poetry. He finished the poem after he returned to Spain in 1563.
