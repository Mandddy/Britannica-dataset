Gaslight, American film noir, released in 1944, that centres on murder and madness in Victorian London. The cast included Charles Boyer, Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotten, and Angela Lansbury in her screen debut.
Bergman portrayed Paula, a young woman who lives with her aunt, a famous opera singer, in London but moves to Italy after her aunt is killed during a burglary. Ten years later, following a brief courtship, she marries the pianist Gregory Anton (played by Boyer), who, unbeknownst to her, is actually the murderer. The couple returns to her aunt’s house, and a series of unexplained incidents lead Paula to suspect that she may be slowly going mad. However, the strange events—such as the mysterious dimming of the gaslights in the house (hence the title of the film)—are actually orchestrated by Gregory in an attempt to drive his young bride mad, institutionalize her, and then steal a cache of jewels hidden somewhere in the house.
