Albany, county, east-central New York state, U.S., bordered by the Mohawk River to the northeast and the Hudson River to the east. The terrain rises from the Hudson valley lowlands in the east to the Helderberg Mountains in the centre of the county; Alcove Reservoir is in the south. Parklands include Thompson’s Lake and John Boyd Thacher state parks. Timber in the western half of the county mainly comprises maple, birch, and beech, while oak and hickory dominate the eastern half.
Algonquian-speaking Mahican (Mohican) Indians inhabited the region when European explorers first arrived. The city of Albany is the county seat and the state capital of New York; the first European to visit the site was the English navigator Henry Hudson in 1609, and by 1624 the area was permanently settled by the Dutch. The Albany Institute of History and Art features 19th-century artwork by the Hudson River school, the first native school of painting in the United States. The New York State Museum is the nation’s oldest and largest state museum. The State University of New York at Albany was founded in 1844. Siena College was established in Loudonville in 1937. Other communities include Guilderland, Delmar, Cohoes, and Watervliet.
