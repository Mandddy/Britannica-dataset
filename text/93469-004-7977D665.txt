Árpád dynasty, rulers of Hungary from the late 9th century until 1301, under whom the Hungarian nation was transformed from a confederation of Hungarian tribes into a powerful state of east-central Europe. The dynasty was named after Árpád (d. 907), who was chosen by seven Hungarian tribes to lead them westward from their dwelling place on the Don River (889). Having crossed the Carpathian Mountains (c. 896), the Hungarians settled on the Pannonian, or Hungarian, Plain and for the next half century raided their neighbours and collected booty. But, after their defeat by Emperor Otto I (Battle of Lechfeld; Aug. 10, 955), they became less belligerent. During the reign of Géza (972–997), Árpád’s great-grandson, they established cordial relations with the West and acknowledged the authority of their king before the authority of their chieftains.
Stephen (István; reigned 997–1038), expanding upon his father’s accomplishments, officially converted his people to Christianity in the Western Church (1000), extended his control over Transylvania (1003), and replaced the tribal political structure with a system of counties, each one ruled by an appointed “count.” Furthermore, by claiming all territory not occupied by freemen as property of the crown, Stephen laid the basis of the Hungarian monarchy’s future wealth and power.
