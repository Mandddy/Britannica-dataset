Arbitration, nonjudicial legal technique for resolving disputes by referring them to a neutral party for a binding decision, or “award.” An arbitrator may consist of a single person or an arbitration board, usually of three members.
Arbitration is most commonly used in the resolution of commercial disputes and is distinct from mediation and conciliation, both of which are common in the settlement of labour disputes between management and labour unions. In mediation, the parties resort to a third person to offer a recommendation for a settlement or to help them to reach a compromise. Such intervention by a third party, which also occurs in international disputes between states in the form of diplomatic intervention and good offices, has no binding force upon the disputants, unlike the arbitrator’s ruling.
