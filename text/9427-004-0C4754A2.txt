Serval,  (Felis serval), long-limbed cat, family Felidae, found in Africa south of the Sahara, especially in grass- and bush-covered country near water. A swift, agile cat, the serval climbs and leaps very well. It is a nocturnal hunter preying on birds and small mammals such as rodents and hares.
The serval is a slender cat with a long neck, small head, and large, slightly cupped ears. The adult is 80 to 100 centimetres (32 to 40 inches) long, the tail accounting for an additional 20â€“30 cm. It stands about 50 cm at the shoulder and weighs about 15 kilograms (33 pounds). The coat is typically long and whitish on the underparts and yellowish to reddish brown above, liberally marked with black spots and stripes. These bold markings are replaced by smaller spots or specks on some individuals, which are known as servaline cats and were once considered a distinct species (Felis brachyura or servalina). All-black individuals are found in some populations, especially those from the high country of Kenya.
