Chengde, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’eng-te, conventional Jehol, Pinyin Rehe,  city in northern Hebei sheng (province), China. The city is situated in the mountains separating the North China Plain from the plateaus of Inner Mongolia, approximately 110 miles (180 km) northeast of Beijing, on the Re River (Re He; “Hot River”), a small tributary of the Luan River. The Re River, so called because of the various hot springs that discharge into it above Chengde, gave its name to the city and to the province of which the city was the capital. Pop. (2002 est.) 329,970.
Until comparatively recent times this area, some 43 miles (69 km) north of the Great Wall of China, was occupied by a succession of non-Chinese peoples. It first became a part of China proper under the Liao dynasty (907–1125), when it was the seat of Xinghua county, in Bei’an prefecture. Under the 12th-century Jin (Juchen) dynasty, Xinghua county became part of Xingzhou, the name of which was retained under the Yuan (Mongols; 1279–1368). With the fall of the Mongols, Chinese authority in the area beyond the Great Wall declined.
