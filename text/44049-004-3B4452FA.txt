Hans Carossa,  (born Dec. 15, 1878, Tölz, Ger.—died  Sept. 12, 1956, Rittsteig, W.Ger.) poet and novelist who contributed to the development of the German autobiographical novel.
Carossa’s literary career began with a book of lyric poetry, Stella Mystica (1902; “Mystical Star”), in which a reflective, philosophical attitude dominates the expression of emotions. This attitude of detachment toward his own life and a desire to seek and bring forth the most noble in humankind remains dominant throughout his work. His first novel, Doktor Bürgers Ende (1913; “The End of Doctor Bürger”; revised and republished in 1930 as Die Schicksale Doktor Bürgers, “The Fortunes of Doctor Bürger”), in which a young doctor, driven to despair by the suffering around him, commits suicide when he fails to save the woman he loves, is an exploration of, as well as a variation on, Goethe’s “Werther” theme—Carossa expressed his indebtedness to Goethe in Die Wirkungen Goethes in der Gegenwart (1938; “Goethe’s Influence Today”). Rumänisches Tagebuch (1924; A Roumanian Diary; republished in 1934 as Tagebuch im Kriege, “War Diary”) is an evaluation of Carossa’s observations as an army doctor in Romania during World War I and a probe into the deeper mysteries of life; it was the first of his books to gain recognition outside of Germany.
