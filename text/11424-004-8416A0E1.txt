Luis de Góngora, in full Luis de Góngora y Argote  (born July 11, 1561, Córdoba, Spain—died May 23, 1627, Córdoba) one of the most influential Spanish poets of his era. His Baroque, convoluted style, known as Gongorism (gongorismo), was so exaggerated by less gifted imitators that his reputation suffered after his death until it underwent a revaluation in the 20th century.
The son of a judge, Góngora profited from his father’s fine library and from relatives in positions to further his education. He attended the University of Salamanca and achieved fame quickly. He took religious orders so that he might receive an ecclesiastical benefice but was not ordained priest until he was 55 years old, when he was named chaplain to the royal court in Madrid. His letters, as well as some of his satirical verse, show an unhappy and financially distressed life vexed by the animosity that some of his writings had evoked. He had strong partisans—Lope de Vega was an admirer—and equally powerful enemies, none more so than his rival Francisco de Quevedo, who outdid even Góngora in mordant and unrelenting satire.
