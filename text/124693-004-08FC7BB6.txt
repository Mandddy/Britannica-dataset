Borer beetle, any of a number of species of insects that are included in the family Anobiidae (order Coleoptera). These beetles tend to be small (1 to 9 mm, or less than 0.5 inch) and cylindrical. When disturbed, they usually pull in their legs and play dead.
The best-known borers are the cigarette beetle, deathwatch beetle, drugstore beetle, and furniture beetle. They live in drugs, cereals, spices, wood, tobacco products, and upholstery materials, and still others live in fungi, seeds, and galls and under bark.
