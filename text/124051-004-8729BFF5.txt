Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, coeducational state institution of higher learning in New Jersey, U.S. Rutgers was founded as private Queens College by the Dutch Reformed Church in 1766. The college struggled to survive in the years after the American Revolution and was closed several times in the early 1800s. It was renamed Rutgers College in 1825 (for the philanthropist Colonel Henry Rutgers) and became, after the Morrill Act of 1862, New Jersey’s land-grant college in 1864, assuming university status in 1924. In 1945 the state legislature extended the name State University of New Jersey to all colleges and divisions of the institution.
