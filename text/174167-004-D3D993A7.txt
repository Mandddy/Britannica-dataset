Saint Nicholas I, byname Nicholas the Great   (born c. 800, Rome—died November 13, 867, Rome; feast day November 13) pope from 858 to 867, master theorist of papal power, considered to have been the most forceful of the early medieval pontiffs, whose pontificate was the most important of the Carolingian period and prepared the way for the 11th-century reform popes.
He had served in the Curia for almost 15 years before his election in April 858 as Pope Benedict III’s successor. His reign was marked by three historically significant contests.
