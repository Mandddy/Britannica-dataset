Redd Foxx, original name John Elroy Sanford  (born December 9, 1922, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.—died October 11, 1991, Los Angeles, California) American comedian and television actor known for his raunchy stand-up routines. His style of comedy, often described as “blue” for its foul language and highly adult subject matter, influenced generations of comics. He was also the star of the hit television series Sanford and Son, which ran on NBC from 1972 to 1977.
While a struggling performer in New York City, Sanford adopted the name Redd Foxx. He performed comedy on the “chitlin circuit” of African American nightclubs during the 1940s and ’50s. By the 1960s, recordings of his comedy acts had become enormously popular among African Americans, though his albums were considered too racy for white audiences and were rarely available in stores with predominantly white customers.
