Faustus Socinus, Italian Fausto (Paolo) Socini, Sozini, or Sozzini   (born Dec. 5, 1539, Siena [Italy]—died March 3, 1604, Luclawice, Pol.) theologian whose anti-Trinitarian theology was later influential in the development of Unitarian theology.
A nephew of the anti-Trinitarian theologian Laelius Socinus, Faustus had no systematic education but early began to reject orthodox Roman Catholic religious doctrines. He was denounced by the Inquisition in 1559 and sought refuge until 1562 in Zürich, where he acquired his uncle Laelius’ papers, which are considered a major source of his beliefs.
