Joseph Victor von Scheffel,  (born February 16, 1826, Karlsruhe, Baden [Germany]—died April 9, 1886, Karlsruhe, Germany) poet and novelist whose immensely popular humorous epic poem Der Trompeter von Säckingen (1854; “The Trumpeter of Säckingen”) and historical novel Ekkehard (1855) appealed to sentimental popular taste and made him one of the most widely read German authors of his time.
Scheffel’s father was a Baden army engineer, and his mother was a poet. At his father’s insistence Scheffel was trained in law at the universities of Munich, Heidelberg, and Berlin and began a career in the Baden civil service in 1848. He soon obtained a leave of absence to travel and study painting in Italy, and in 1853 he resigned his legal post and turned to literature. He served as librarian to Prince Fürstenberg at Donaueschingen from 1857 to 1859. In 1865 he was given the title of privy councillor, and in 1876 he was given a patent of nobility.
