Keiō University, Japanese Keiō Gijuku Daigaku,  private institution of higher learning located in Tokyo, Japan. The university is part of a larger organization, Keiō Gijuku, that includes elementary and secondary schools in its system.
Keiō was founded as a private school in 1858 by the liberal educator Fukuzawa Yukichi. It acquired the name Keiō in 1868—named for the Japanese historical period (1865–68) that immediately preceded the Meiji Restoration and the start of the Meiji period (1868–1912). It began to function as a college in 1890. Fukuzawa’s original purpose was to create an alternative to the nationalistic and authoritarian government-controlled universities, which were at that time devoted to serving the national interests and training future government leaders rather than to fostering free inquiry. Keiō was not officially recognized by the Ministry of Education as a university until 1920. That allowed it to avoid state supervision and thus to provide a freer academic environment, with greater emphasis on individual development than prevailed at such government schools as Tokyo Imperial University (now the University of Tokyo). Because opportunities in government service have since the late 19th century been largely confined to graduates of government universities, Keiō has concentrated on studies directed toward work in the private sector, such as business and law, and has produced many leaders in banking and industry.
