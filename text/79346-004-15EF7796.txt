Flora Adams Darling, née Flora Adams  (born July 25, 1840, Lancaster, N.H., U.S.—died Jan. 6, 1910, New York, N.Y.)  American writer, historian, and organizer, an influential though controversial figure in the founding and early years of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and other patriotic societies.
Educated at Lancaster Academy, Flora Adams in 1860 married Edward I. Darling, who died during the Civil War (no records confirm her later claim that he was a Confederate army officer), and after some difficulty she made her way back north. She soon instituted a claim against the federal government for recompense for valuables allegedly stolen from her luggage by Union soldiers. Prosecuting the claim became one of her chief occupations, and it was not ultimately settled until 1903, when she won a modest award. She was employed at various times in Washington, D.C., and during the 1880s she began to write for publication. Mrs. Darling’s Letters, or Memories of the Civil War (1883) was followed by A Social Diplomat and A Winning, Wayward Woman (both 1889), Senator Athens, C.S.A. (1889), Was It a Just Verdict? (1890), and others, and she also contributed romantic and sensational short stories to various magazines.
