Siren, any member of the family Sirenidae (order Caudata), a group of four species of aquatic salamanders that resemble eels. Their long, slender bodies are usually brown, dark gray, or greenish. The forelegs are tiny, and the hind legs and pelvis are absent. Young and adults have feathery gills.
Sirens usually burrow in mud in the bottom of marshes or streams or hide among water plants or stones; however, on rare occasions they may venture onto dry land for brief periods. Out of the water, they can make a soft yelping or squeaking sound. Their principal diet is made up of aquatic insects and other invertebrates, which they catch at night. They mate in the water and lay eggs singly or in batches on the leaves of water plants. It is not known whether fertilization is internal or external. The young develop into adults without metamorphosis, or radical physical change, and some live at least 25 years or longer in captivity.
