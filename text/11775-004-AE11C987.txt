Forth Bridge, railway bridge over the Firth of Forth, the estuary of the River Forth in Scotland. It was one of the first cantilever bridges and for several years was the world’s longest span. Designed and built by Benjamin Baker in the late 1880s, its opening stirred controversy on aesthetic grounds, the poet and artist William Morris declaring it “the supremest specimen of all ugliness,” a judgment greatly softened by the passage of time. Making use of the rocky isle of Inchgarvie in the middle of the deep firth as a foundation for one of three giant (1,350-foot [411-metre]) cantilevers (projecting members supported at only one end), Baker joined the cantilevers together with two suspended spans of 350 feet (107 m) each, making a total of 1,700 feet (518 m) of clear spans over either arm of the firth. The 12-foot- (4-metre-) diameter tubes forming the cantilevers, the roadway, and approach spans consumed the hitherto unheard-of quantity of 58,000 tons of steel. The cost of the bridge, extraordinary for its day, was £3,000,000 (about $15,000,000).
The Forth Road Bridge, completed in 1964, is a suspension structure with a main span of 3,300 feet (1,000 m).
