Sheet-web weaver (family Linyphiidae), a rather common group of small spiders (order Araneida) numbering about 2,000 species worldwide. Most are less than 6 mm (1/4 inch) in length and are seldom seen. Their webs are flat and sheetlike and dome- or cup-shaped. The spider is usually found on the lower side of the web and often between two layers of webbing. The hammock spider (Linyphia phrygiana), native to North America, builds a hammock-shaped web.
