Odissi, one of the principal classical dance styles of India; others include bharata natyam, kuchipudi, kathak, kathakali, and manipuri. It is indigenous to Orissa, eastern India, and follows the principles of the Natya-shastra. Its close replication of poses found on classical temple sculptures suggests great antiquity. Related to bharata natyam in its basic pattern, odissi emphasizes sinuous postures and is enlivened by a variety of elevations and jumps. It is predominantly a dance for women.
