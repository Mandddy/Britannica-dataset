Dharmapāla, (
        Sanskrit: “defender of the religious law”) Tibetan drag-gshed (“cruel, wrathful hangman”),  in Tibetan Buddhism, any one of a group of eight divinities who, though benevolent, are represented as hideous and ferocious in order to instill terror in evil spirits.
Worship of dharmapālas was initiated in the 8th century by the magician-saint Padmasambhava, who is said to have conquered the malevolent deities in Tibet and forced them to take an oath promising to protect Buddhists and the Buddhist faith. Many of the dharmapālas can be linked to Hindu, Bon (the indigenous religion of Tibet), or folk deities.
