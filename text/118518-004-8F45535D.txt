Union Pacific Railroad Company, company that extended the American railway system to the Pacific Coast; it was incorporated by an act of the U.S. Congress on July 1, 1862. The original rail line was built westward 1,006 miles (1,619 km) from Omaha, Nebraska, to meet the Central Pacific, which was being built eastward from Sacramento, California. The two railroads were joined at Promontory, Utah, on May 10, 1869 (see Golden Spike National Historic Site).
The Union Pacific was largely financed by federal loans and land grants, but it overextended itself through its involvement in the Cr√©dit Mobilier scandal, in which a few manipulators reaped enormous profits. After exposure of the scheme, which left the railroad badly in debt, the company went into receivership in 1893. It was reorganized in 1897 under the leadership of Edward H. Harriman, who was responsible for major improvements and standardization and who led the railroad to participate in the economic development of the West. Harriman used the railroad as a holding company for the securities of other transportation companies in his empire. His son, W. Averell Harriman, was chairman of the board of Union Pacific from 1932 to 1946.
