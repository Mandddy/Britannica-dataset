Shogi, Japanese shōgi,  Japanese form of chess, the history of which is obscure. Traditionally it is thought to have originated in India and to have been transmitted to Japan via China and Korea.
Shogi, like Western chess and Chinese chess, is played by two persons on a board with pieces of varying powers, and the object of the game is to checkmate (“trap”) the opposing king. The shogi chessboard has 81 squares (9 by 9), compared with the 64 squares (8 by 8) of the Western chessboard and the 90 points (intersection of 9 by 10 lines) of the Chinese chessboard. Unlike other chess variants, shogi pieces are not differentiated by colour to indicate side, though opposing players are known as white and black, with black moving first. The pieces are flat and printed with Japanese characters that indicate rank and are pointed at one end, with the pointed ends oriented toward the opponent. Shogi is unique among chess variants in that captured pieces are not dead but may be pointed in the opposite direction and replayed (“dropped”) as part of the captor’s forces in place of making a move with other pieces already on the chessboard. Certain restrictions apply to dropping. In particular, pieces cannot be dropped such that they have no future moves (at or near the opposite edge), pawns cannot be dropped on the same column in which a player already has a pawn, and pawns cannot be dropped to deliver checkmate.
