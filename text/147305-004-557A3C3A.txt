Magneto, permanent-magnet generator mainly employed for ignition of compressed gasses in internal combustion engines. Primary applications have been in small aircraft, marine, tractor, and motorcycle engines, which may not have an available battery supply. The major parts of the magneto are a permanent-magnet rotor, an armature with a primary winding containing a small number of turns, a parallel-connected capacitor, a secondary winding with a large number of turns, and a cam-type circuit breaker. As the magnetic rotor is turned, it induces a current in the primary winding. The cam breaks the circuit when the induced current is near its peak. The rapid change of magnetic field causes a high voltage to be induced in the secondary winding. This is distributed to the spark plugs for ignition.
