Ovonramwen, also called Overami   (died January 1914, Calabar, Southern Nigeria [now Nigeria]) West African ruler who was the last independent oba (king) of the 500-year-old kingdom of Benin (in present-day Nigeria). Ovonramwen tried to maintain his independence in the face of increasing British pressure but was able to delay for only a few years the annexation of his kingdom by the colony of Nigeria.
He was called Idugbowa until he took the title Ovonramwen upon becoming oba. He succeeded to a kingdom much reduced by growing British commercial and colonial encroachment from its greatest extent (c. 1700). He attempted to seal Benin off from Europeans but by 1892 was forced to sign a protection treaty with the British administration. Disputes over trade along the Benin River (1892â€“94) led to a campaign against Benin; the murder of the British acting consul general in January 1897 precipitated a full-scale military expedition, which captured Benin City in February 1897. Ovonramwen surrendered to the British in August and died in exile.
