Robert Hamerling, original name Rupert Johann Hammerling   (born March 24, 1830, Kirchberg am Walde, Austria—died  July 13, 1889, Graz) Austrian poet remembered chiefly for his epics.
After studying in Vienna, he became a teacher in Trieste (1855–66). He wrote several popular collections of lyrics, including Ein Schwanenlied der Romantik (1862; “A Swan Song of the Romantic”), which have some attractive rhythms but not much originality. His most important works are his epic poems: Ahasver in Rom (1866; “Ahasuerus in Rome”), a grandiosely romantic retelling of the myth of the wandering Jew, which, in spite of its brilliant descriptions, suffers from theatricality; and Der König von Sion (1869; “The King of Zion”), a narrative of the Anabaptist movement of 1534. Hamerling’s other works include dramas, a novel, and autobiographical writings such as Stationen meiner Lebenspilgerschaft (1889; “Stations on My Life’s Journey”). His collected works (4 vol., 1900) were edited by M. Rabenlechner.
