Song Qingling, Wade-Giles romanization Sung Ch’ing-ling, Song also spelled Soong  (born January 27, 1893, Shanghai, China—died May 29, 1981, Beijing) second wife of the Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen (Sun Zhongshan). She became an influential political figure in China after her husband’s death.
A member of the prominent Soong family, Song Qingling was educated in the United States. She married Sun Yat-sen, who was 26 years her senior, in 1914. After Sun’s death in 1925, Song Qingling assumed an active role in politics. She supported the left wing of the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, which had been founded by Sun) when it split with the right wing of the party, later headed by Chiang Kai-shek. In 1927, when the left-wing Nationalists purged their communist members and reunited with the right-wing Nationalists, she denounced the organization as having betrayed the ideals of her husband, and she left China for the Soviet Union, where she remained for two years.
