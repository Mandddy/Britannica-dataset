Lycoperdaceae,  family of fungi in the order Agaricales (phylum Basidiomycota, kingdom Fungi) that includes about 160 species, among them earthstars and puffballs, which are found in soil or on decaying wood in grassy areas and woods. Many puffballs, named for the features of the fruiting body (basidiocarp), are edible before maturity, at which time the internal tissues become dry and powdery. Puffs of spores discharge when the fruiting structure is disturbed. Calbovista subsculpta, an edible puffball, is found along old road beds and in pastures.
Lycoperdon is a genus of 50 cosmopolitan species of small common puffballs. L. perlatum (gemmatum) has spotlike scars on the surface and is edible only when young. These fungi are found in the woods or on sawdust in summer and autumn.
