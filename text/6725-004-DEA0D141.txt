Bluebell, any plant of the genus Hyacinthoides of the family Hyacinthaceae, native to Eurasia. The bell-shaped blue flower clusters of bluebell, or wild hyacinth (H. nonscriptus or Endymion nonscriptus), and Spanish bluebell (H. hispanicus) are borne on plants about 30 centimetres (1 foot) tall. Both species are cultivated as garden ornamentals. Some authorities consider them as belonging to the related genus Scilla of the same family.
Many other plants are commonly known as bluebells, including species of the genera Campanula, Eustoma, Polemonium, and Clematis. In the United States the name bluebell is usually reserved for Mertensia virginica.
