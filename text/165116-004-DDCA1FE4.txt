Antenor,  (flourished c. 540–500 bc)  Athenian sculptor of the late Archaic period who carved the first group of statues of the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogiton for the Athenian agora and a kore (a freestanding figure of a maiden) for the Acropolis (now in the Acropolis Museum in Athens).
Antenor’s bronze sculpture of the tyrannicides probably dates from about 510. In 480, when Xerxes I captured Athens, the sculpture was carried off to Susa and was perhaps melted down at a later date. Bronze replicas of the statues, made by Critius and Nesiotes, replaced the originals in 477 or 476 bc. There are elements of motion and accurate anatomical detail in the work that mark the transition between the Archaic and Classical eras; they may be regarded as the first masterpieces of freestanding sculpture of the early Classical period. Antenor’s kore, which probably dates from about 530 to 520, is one of the finest examples of late Archaic sculpture. The greater part of this figure was found in 1886, northwest of the Erechtheum, on the Acropolis. It is of marble, larger than life, and traces of its painted colour remain.
