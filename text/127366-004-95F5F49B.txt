Geothermal energy, form of energy conversion in which heat energy from within Earth is captured and harnessed for cooking, bathing, space heating, electrical power generation, and other uses.
Heat from Earth’s interior generates surface phenomena such as lava flows, geysers, fumaroles, hot springs, and mud pots. The heat is produced mainly by the radioactive decay of potassium, thorium, and uranium in Earth’s crust and mantle and also by friction generated along the margins of continental plates. The subsequent annual low-grade heat flow to the surface averages between 50 and 70 milliwatts (mW) per square metre worldwide. In contrast, incoming solar radiation striking Earth’s surface provides 342 watts per square metre annually. Geothermal heat energy can be recovered and exploited for human use, and it is available anywhere on Earth’s surface. The estimated energy that can be recovered and utilized on the surface is 4.5 × 106 exajoules, or about 1.4 × 106 terawatt-years, which equates to roughly three times the world’s annual consumption of all types of energy.
