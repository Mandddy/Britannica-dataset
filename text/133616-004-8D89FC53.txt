Abraham Isaac Kook,  (born 1865, Greiva, Courland, Latviaâ€”died  Sept. 1, 1935, Jerusalem) Jewish mystic, fervent Zionist, and first chief rabbi of Palestine under the League of Nations mandate to Great Britain to administer Palestine.
After serving as rabbi in a number of small towns in eastern Europe, in 1904 Kook became rabbi of the seaport city of Jaffa in Palestine, and he established a yeshiva, or Jewish academy, there. During World War I, Kook, who had left Palestine for a visit to Germany, was interned as an alien, but he escaped to England via Switzerland. He became rabbi of the congregation Machzike Hadath in London, where he aroused popular support for the Balfour Declaration (1917), which furnished the basis for the League of Nations Palestinian mandate. After the war, in 1919, Kook was appointed rabbi of the Ashkenazic (German and Polish) communities in Jerusalem and in 1921 was elected chief rabbi of Palestine, a post he held for the rest of his life.
