Guadalupe Mountains National Park, rugged mountain mass of uplifted marine fossil reef in the Chihuahuan Desert of western Texas, U.S., just southwest of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The park, authorized in 1966 and established in 1972, has an area of 135 square miles (350 square km).
The Guadalupe Mountains, a division of the Sacramento Mountains, are part of the ancient horseshoe-shaped Capitan Reef that formed beneath a tropical ocean some 250 million years ago. The huge limestone reef, extending across portions of what is now New Mexico and Texas, was buried by sediment; portions were later uplifted to form a number of features, including the Guadalupe Mountains. (Carlsbad Caverns National Park also is located in this formation.) In the park the exposed reef, with striking drop-offs on its east and west sides, rises to a massive promontory called El Capitan, with an elevation of 8,078 feet (2,462 metres). Nearby is Guadalupe Peak, at 8,749 feet (2,667 metres) the highest point in Texas.
