Binturong (Arctictis binturong), also called bear cat or cat bear,  catlike carnivore of the civet family (Viverridae), found in dense forests of southern Asia, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It has long, shaggy hair, tufted ears, and a long, bushy, prehensile tail. The colour generally is black with a sprinkling of whitish hairs. The head and body measure about 60–95 centimetres (24–38 inches) and the tail an additional 55–90 centimetres (22–35 inches); weight ranges from about 9 to 14 kilograms (20 to 31 pounds). The binturong is principally nocturnal and arboreal in habit, using its prehensile tail as an aid in climbing. It feeds mainly on fruit but also takes eggs and small animals. In some areas it is tamed and is reported to make an affectionate pet.
