Motilal Nehru, in full Pandit Motilal Nehru  (born May 6, 1861, Delhi, India—died Feb. 6, 1931, Lucknow) a leader of the Indian independence movement, cofounder of the Swaraj (“Self-rule”) Party, and the father of India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Motilal, a member of a prosperous Brahman family of Kashmiri origin, early established a lucrative law practice and was admitted to the Allahabad High Court in 1896. He shunned politics until middle age, when, in 1907, at Allahabad, he presided over a provincial conference of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party), a political organization striving for dominion status for India. He was considered a moderate (one who advocated constitutional reform, in contrast to the extremists, who employed agitational methods) until 1919, when he made his newly radicalized views known by means of a daily newspaper he founded, The Independent.
