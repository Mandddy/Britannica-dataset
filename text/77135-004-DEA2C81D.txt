Marie Dressler, original name Leila Marie Koerber  (born Nov. 9, 1868, Cobourg, Ont., Can.â€”died July 28, 1934, Santa Barbara, Calif., U.S.) Canadian-born comedian and singer who achieved her greatest success toward the end of her life.
Dressler was the daughter of a piano teacher and early in life discovered her ability to make audiences laugh. She made her stage debut in Michigan in 1886 and then performed for three years with the George Baker Opera Company. After a long upward climb from stock companies to vaudeville to the chorus line, she first appeared on Broadway in the musical The Robber of the Rhine (1892) and later attained Broadway stardom in the 1896 musical comedy Lady Slavey. Throughout the next decade she shared the stage with such popular performers as Weber and Fields, Anna Held, and Lillian Russell, entertaining audiences with her broad, outrageous physical humour and her superb singing voice.
