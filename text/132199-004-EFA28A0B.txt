Paul Sérusier, in full Louis-Paul-Henri Sérusier  (born November 9, 1864, Paris—died October 6, 1927, Morlaix, France) French Post-Impressionist painter and theorist who was instrumental in the formation of the short-lived, but highly influential, late 19th-century art movement known as the Nabis. The group was noted for its expressive use of colour and pattern in the mode of Paul Gauguin. Sérusier’s early paintings featuring the people and landscapes of Brittany are noteworthy for their muted, contemplative mood, which the artist achieved by using firm contours and blocks of unmodulated colour.
Sérusier’s father was a businessman of Flemish descent. As a boy, Sérusier attended the Lycée Condorcet, a secondary school that placed much emphasis on the study of philosophy, and he received a baccalaureate in letters in 1883. Not much interested in the sales job that his practical father helped him obtain, he determined to become an artist and in 1885 entered the Académie Julian, a noted private art school in Paris. While there he met and befriended the young Maurice Denis, who would become a major influence in the revival of religious art in France. During the summer of 1888 Sérusier traveled to Pont-Aven in Brittany, which was a popular gathering place for artists. There he met French painter and theorist Émile Bernard, who at the time was engaged in translating the theories of the Symbolist poets to the medium of paint. That summer, in conversations and painting sessions, Bernard and his friend Paul Gauguin developed their notions about the freedom to move beyond Impressionism and its studies of light and nature—to simplify, interpret, and arrange nature.
