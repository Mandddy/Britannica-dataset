Scottie Pippen,  (born Sept. 25, 1965, Hamburg, Ark., U.S.) American professional basketball player who won six National Basketball Association (NBA) titles (1991–93, 1996–98) as a member of the Chicago Bulls.
Pippen played high school basketball but stood just 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres) upon graduation. However, he had grown 2 inches (5 cm) by the time he entered the University of Central Arkansas, where he initially served as manager of the basketball team before earning a spot on the roster. By his senior year he was 6 feet 7 inches (2 metres) tall and was the team’s best player. In 1987 the Seattle SuperSonics selected Pippen in the first round of the NBA draft and traded him to Chicago. During his rookie season (1987–88), he became a regular in the Bulls’ lineup. Pippen possessed a notably multifaceted skill set: his size and strength served him well under the basket, while his ball-handling skills and shooting touch made him a threat from the outside. On defense, his long arms and quick footwork made him an imposing force and helped Pippen earn selection to the NBA’s All-Defensive first team eight times over the course of his career.
