Sam Brownback, in full Samuel Dale Brownback  (born Sept. 12, 1956, Garnett, Kan., U.S.) American politician, who served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1995–96) and of the U.S. Senate (1996–2011) and who pursued the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. In 2011 he became governor of Kansas.
Brownback was raised on his family’s farm near Parker, Kan., and was the state president of the Future Farmers of America in high school, where his passion for politics began. He graduated from Kansas State University (where he was student body president) in 1978 and received a law degree from the University of Kansas in 1982. After graduating from law school, Brownback worked as an attorney in Manhattan, Kan., for four years before turning to public service. He was appointed secretary of the state board of agriculture in 1986, a position he held until 1993, and he was a White House fellow in 1990. In 1994 Brownback was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as part of the landslide that gave the Republicans a majority. After Kansas Sen. Bob Dole resigned his position to campaign for the presidency in 1996, Brownback won a special election to fill the vacant Senate seat by running on a strongly conservative platform. He was easily reelected in 1998 and 2004, in the latter election garnering the highest number of votes for any office in Kansas history.
