Carl Johan Gustaf, Count Snoilsky,  (born Sept. 8, 1841, Stockholm, Swed.—died  May 19, 1903, Stockholm) Swedish poet who was the most notable of a group of early realist poets.
While a student at the University of Uppsala, Snoilsky gained repute for his great poetic talent. His Dikter (1869; “Poems”), written during an extended tour of the European continent and including his Italian Pictures (1865), enchanted the Swedish public with its carefree and sensuous celebrations of the Mediterranean landscape. After its publication Snoilsky joined the diplomatic corps, married advantageously, stopped writing, and lived the life of a Swedish aristocrat. In 1879, however, he ran away from that life, remarried, settled on the continent, and started writing poetry again. Three volumes of his verse appeared, respectively, in 1881, 1883, and 1887. Snoilsky felt the need to write poetry reflecting the social problems he saw, and his later verse expresses his humane liberalism and his sympathy for the underprivileged. He returned to Stockholm in 1890 and remained there until his death. Snoilsky’s poetry is clear, elegant, and polished, with a strong note of realism in spite of its rather traditional form.
