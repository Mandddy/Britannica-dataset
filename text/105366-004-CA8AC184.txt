Battle of Chancellorsville, (May 1–5, 1863), in the American Civil War, bloody assault by the Union army in Virginia that failed to encircle and destroy the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia.
Following the “horror of Fredericksburg” (December 13, 1862), the Confederate army of Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Union force under Gen. Joseph Hooker had spent the winter facing each other across the Rappahannock River in Virginia. On April 27 Hooker dispatched his cavalry behind Lee’s army, intending to cut off a retreat. Two days later he sent a diversionary force consisting of two corps—roughly 30,000 men under the command of Gen. John Sedgwick—across the Rappahannock below Fredericksburg and crossed upriver with the main body of his army.
