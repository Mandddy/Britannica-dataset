Morrison Remick Waite,  (born Nov. 29, 1816, Lyme, Conn., U.S.—died  March 23, 1888, Washington, D.C.) seventh chief justice of the United States (1874–88), who frequently spoke for the Supreme Court in interpreting the post-Civil War constitutional amendments and in redefining governmental jurisdiction over commerce in view of the great expansion of American business. Reacting against the extreme nationalism predominant during the Civil War and in the early Reconstruction years, the Waite court did much to rehabilitate the idea of states’ rights.
The son of a justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, Waite practiced law in Toledo, Ohio. In 1871–72 he became nationally prominent as one of the U.S. counsels to the Alabama arbitration commission at Geneva, dealing with Great Britain’s liability to the United States for permitting Confederate warships to be built and serviced in British ports. The favourable impression he made on President Ulysses S. Grant at that time led to his appointment as chief justice by Grant on Jan. 19, 1874.
