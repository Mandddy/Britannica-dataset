Water net, alga of the genus Hydrodictyon, sometimes found on the surface of quiet ponds as a free-floating network of multinucleate cells arranged in hexagons or pentagons and up to 20 cm (7.9 inches) in total length. Sexual reproduction is by fusion of similar gametes (isogamy). Asexual reproduction is by motile zoospores, hundreds of them contained in each cell becoming arranged in small netlike structures. When a mature Hydrodictyon net dissociates, each cell liberates a miniature net. Because of its reproductive efficiency, Hydrodictyon proliferates rapidly and is often a problem in ponds, recreational waters, and irrigation canals.
