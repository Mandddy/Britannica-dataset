The Innocents, British horror film, released in 1961, that is widely considered one of the best ghost stories ever filmed and the finest screen adaptation of Henry James’s novella The Turn of the Screw (1898).
Deborah Kerr portrayed Miss Giddens, a spinster governess, hired by an affluent bachelor (played by Michael Redgrave) to care for his young niece (Pamela Franklin) and nephew (Martin Stephens), who were orphaned and have been sent to live with him in his remote British mansion. She soon suspects that the children are possessed by the spirits of the former governess, Miss Jessel, and their uncle’s late valet, Peter Quint, who had carried on a lurid affair. However, it is unclear whether the ghostly happenings are real or merely imagined by the troubled Giddens. Her efforts to save the children have tragic results.
