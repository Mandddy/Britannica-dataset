Natchez Trace Parkway, scenic and historic roadway, extending 444 miles (715 km) through Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee, U.S. It begins in Natchez, Mississippi, and, generally following a Native American trail in a northeasterly direction, ends near Nashville, Tennessee. It passes through the Mississippi cities of Jackson and Tupelo (the parkway headquarters) and crosses Tombigbee National Forest in Mississippi and the Tennessee River in the northwestern corner of Alabama. Established in 1938 and administered by the U.S. National Park Service, the narrow parkway covers a total area of 81 square miles (210 square km).
The trace was originally a game trail used by the Choctaw, Natchez, and Chickasaw peoples. In the late 18th century, boatmen who floated down the Mississippi River with flatboats of goods would sell both the goods and the boats and use the trace as an overland route back to the Ohio River valley. From 1800 to 1820 it was the most important highway in the Old Southwest—militarily, economically, and politically. With the advent of the river steamer and of newer, more direct roads after the War of 1812, it began a gradual decline. Among the historical landmarks along its Mississippi route are Emerald Mound (c. 1400), the country’s second largest ceremonial mound, built by ancestors of the Natchez; the restored Mount Locust Inn (c. 1780); the Bynum Mounds (c. 100 bc–ad 200); and Chickasaw Village (formerly Ackia Battleground), with exhibits on Chickasaw history and daily life. Napier Mine and Metal Ford in Tennessee hark back to frontier iron mining and smelting. The grave of explorer Meriwether Lewis is a short distance north of the trace in south-central Tennessee, near Hohenwald. The parkway passes through Mississippi cypress swamps and farm fields, Appalachian foothills, and Tennessee oak and hickory forests. Wildlife includes white-tailed deer, armadillos, beavers, raccoons, and opossums.
