James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, also called (from 1717) Viscount Stanhope Of Mahon, Baron Stanhope Of Elvaston   (born 1673, Paris, France—died  Feb. 5, 1721, London, Eng.) British soldier and statesman, the dominant minister during the first half (1714–21) of the reign of King George I. His policy of alliance with France secured the peace and minimized foreign support for the Jacobites, who sought to restore the Stuart monarchy in England.
The grandson of the 1st Earl of Chesterfield and the son of a British diplomat, Stanhope began a brilliant military career in 1691. In 1708, during the War of the Spanish Succession against France (1701–14), he became commander in chief of the English army in Spain and captured Minorca, but French forces defeated and captured him at Brihuega in December 1710. After his release in August 1712, he returned to England and the House of Commons, where he had sat as a Whig since 1701 and had played a major role in the attack against Henry Sacheverell in 1710.
