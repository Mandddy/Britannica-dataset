Emily Blackwell,  (born Oct. 8, 1826, Bristol, Eng.—died Sept. 7, 1910, York Cliffs, Maine, U.S.)  English-born American physician and educator who, with her elder sister, Elizabeth Blackwell, contributed greatly to the education and acceptance of women medical professionals in the United States.
Like her sister, Emily was well educated by the private tutors afforded her by her affluent and cultivated family. She grew up in New York City, in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in 1848, following her sister’s example, she began studying medicine. She was rejected by several medical schools, including the Geneva (New York) Medical College, which had accepted Elizabeth. In 1852–53 Emily attended Rush Medical College in Chicago until outside pressures forced the school to dismiss her. At last she gained admittance to the medical college of Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, from which she graduated in March 1854. She subsequently pursued further studies in Edinburgh under Sir James Young Simpson, in London under William Jenner, and in Paris, Berlin, and Dresden, Germany.
