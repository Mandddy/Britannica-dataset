Secretariat, byname Big Red,  (foaled 1970), American racehorse (Thoroughbred) who is widely considered the greatest horse of the second half of the 20th century. A record-breaking money winner, in 1973 he became the ninth winner of the U.S. Triple Crown (the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes). In his short, brilliant 16-month career, he came in first 16 times, second three times, and third once, winning a total of $1,316,808. At Belmont he won by an unprecedented 31 lengths and established the dirt-track record for a 11/2-mile race of 2:24.
Secretariat was born in 1970 at the Meadow Farm in Doswell, Virginia. In his debut race at the Aqueduct Racetrack in New York on July 4, 1972, Secretariat exhibited great speed and managed to finish a credible fourth, making up seven of over eight lengths on the leading horse in the last 1/4 mile. In his second race, 11 days later, he displayed the powerful stretch-running ability that would make him famous, gaining strength the farther he ran. He won easily by six lengths, making him the crowd favourite for his third race, on July 31, which he again won. That race marked his first ride by Ron Turcotte, who from then on was the coltâ€™s primary jockey. With his first wins under his belt, the time had arrived for Secretariat to prove that he was something special. The six-furlong Sanford Stakes in New York on August 16 was his first event against high-end competition. Seemingly trapped going into the final turn, Secretariat knifed his way between horses down the stretch, flashed into the lead, and won by three lengths.
