Panchatantra, (
        Sanskrit: “Five Treatises” or “Five Chapters”)  also spelled Pancatantra ,  collection of Indian animal fables, which has had extensive circulation both in the country of its origin and throughout the world. In Europe the work was known under the name The Fables of Bidpai (for the narrator, an Indian sage, Bidpai, called Vidyapati in Sanskrit), and one version reached the West as early as the 11th century.
In theory, the Panchatantra is intended as a textbook of niti (“policy,” especially for kings and statesmen); the aphorisms tend to glorify shrewdness and cleverness rather than altruism. The original text is a mixture of Sanskrit prose and stanzas of verse, with the stories contained within one of the five frame stories. The introduction, which acts as an enclosing frame for the entire work, attributes the stories to a learned Brahmin named Vishnusharman, who used the form of animal fables to instruct the three dull-witted sons of a king.
