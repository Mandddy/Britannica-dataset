Sergeant York, American war film, released in 1941, that was noted for Gary Cooper’s Academy Award-winning portrayal of Alvin York, one of the most decorated and celebrated American heroes of World War I. The inspirational film, directed by Howard Hawks and cowritten by John Huston, was nominated for 11 Oscars and was the highest-grossing movie of 1941.
The film begins when York—one of 11 children born into a poor family in northern Tennessee—is a young man. An incorrigible troublemaker, he drinks heavily and fights often. However, after being struck by lightning, he undergoes a religious awakening that turns his life around. Assisting in his conversion is Pastor Rosier Pile (played by Walter Brennan). York becomes a pacifist and tries to forgo service in the U.S. Army during World War I by declaring himself a conscientious objector. Forced to serve nonetheless, he is shipped overseas and participates in the battles of the Meuse-Argonne. After seeing his best friend shot and killed, he finds his will to fight, and on one day in October 1918, amid heavy enemy fire, York (an expert marksman) works his way behind enemy lines and single-handedly takes out a machine-gun nest, killing more than two dozen Germans, including several who charge him with fixed bayonets, and taking 132 prisoners. For his valour York receives the Medal of Honor.
