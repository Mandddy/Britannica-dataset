Kuei Xing, Wade-Giles romanization Kâ€™uei Hsing,  in Chinese religion, a brilliant but ugly dwarf who, as the god of examinations, became the deity of scholars who took imperial examinations.
Kuei Xing, whose name before deification was Zhong Kuei, is said to have passed his own examination with remarkable success but was denied the usual honours when the emperor beheld his ugly features. Brokenhearted, Kuei attempted suicide. He would have died, according to one account, had not an ao fish (or an ao turtle) borne him to safety. Another account says that Kuei actually died.
