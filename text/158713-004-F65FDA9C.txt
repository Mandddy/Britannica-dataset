Warren Beatty, original name Henry Warren Beaty  (born March 30, 1937, Richmond, Virginia, U.S.) talented and handsome American leading man who has also produced, directed, and written screenplays. He is best known for his politically charged portrayals of somewhat outcast but charming heroes.
The younger brother of actress Shirley MacLaine, Beatty attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, for one year before studying with famed acting coach Stella Adler in New York City. He occasionally appeared on stage and then in 1959 earned a recurring role in the television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959–63). Beatty made a strong screen debut as a tortured teenager in love in Elia Kazan’s Splendor in the Grass (1961), but his next films, although interesting efforts, were mostly financial disappointments.
