Lindsay Anderson, in full Lindsay Gordon Anderson   (born April 17, 1923, Bangalore, India—died  Aug. 30, 1994, near Angoulême, France) English critic and stage and motion-picture director.
Anderson received a degree in English from the University of Oxford and in 1947 became a founding editor of the film magazine Sequence, which lasted until 1951. Subsequently he wrote for Sight and Sound and other journals. Anderson began directing in 1948, making documentaries for an industrial firm, and in 1955 he won an Academy Award for his short documentary Thursday’s Children. In 1956 he coined the term Free Cinema to denote that movement in the British cinema inspired by John Osborne’s play Look Back in Anger (1956). Anderson and other members of the movement allied themselves with left-wing politics and took their themes from contemporary urban working-class life.
