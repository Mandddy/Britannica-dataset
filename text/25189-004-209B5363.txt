André Le Nôtre,  (born March 12, 1613, Paris, France—died  Sept. 15, 1700, Paris) one of the greatest French landscape architects, his masterpiece being the gardens of Versailles.
Le Nôtre grew up in an atmosphere of technical expertise; his father, Jean Le Nôtre, was the master gardener of King Louis XIII at the Tuileries. At the studio of painter François Vouet he studied the laws of perspective and optics, which he meticulously followed in his plans, and from François Mansart, uncle of Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the principal architect of Versailles, he learned the principles of architecture. Succeeding his father (1637), Le Nôtre redesigned the Tuileries gardens, revealing his genius for expansive vistas. He continued the main avenue, later called the Champs-Élysées, as far as the eye could see.
