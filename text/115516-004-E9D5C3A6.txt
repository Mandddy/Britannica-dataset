John McEnroe, in full John Patrick McEnroe, Jr.  (born Feb. 16, 1959, Wiesbaden, W.Ger.) American tennis player who established himself as a leading competitor in the late 1970s and the â€™80s. He also was noted for his poor behaviour on court, which resulted in a number of fines and suspensions and, on Jan. 21, 1990, in his default at the Australian Open.
McEnroe grew up in Douglaston, N.Y., and received tennis training at the Port Washington Tennis Academy nearby. He first attracted international attention as an amateur in 1977, when at the age of 18 he became the youngest man to reach the Wimbledon semifinals. He enrolled at Stanford (Calif.) University in 1977, but, after winning the U.S. collegiate title in 1978, he left school and turned professional. In his first six months as a professional, McEnroe had acquired a record of 49 wins and only 7 losses.
