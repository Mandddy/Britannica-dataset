Sandra Cisneros,  (born December 20, 1954, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American short-story writer and poet best known for her groundbreaking evocation of Mexican American life in Chicago.
After graduating from Chicago’s Loyola University (B.A., 1976), Cisneros attended the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop (M.F.A., 1978). There she developed what was to be the theme of most of her writing, her unique experiences as a Hispanic woman in a largely alien culture.
