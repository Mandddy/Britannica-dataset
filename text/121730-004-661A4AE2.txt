University of Connecticut, state system of universities composed of a main campus in Storrs and branches in Groton (called Avery Point), Hartford (West Hartford), Stamford, Torrington, and Waterbury, as well as a health centre in Farmington. All campuses are coeducational. The Storrs campus consists of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences as well as 12 professional schools, among them the schools of law, engineering, medicine, and dental medicine. Important facilities include the National Undersea Research Center at Avery Point and the Institute for Materials Science, the State Museum of Natural History, and the William Benton Museum of Art in Storrs.

In 1881 the Connecticut General Assembly created the Storrs Agricultural School from land and funds donated by Augustus and Charles Storrs. The school became a college in 1893, and six years later the name was changed to Connecticut Agriculture College. As the mission of the college broadened, the name was changed to Connecticut State College and finally, in 1939, to the University of Connecticut. The Hartford and Waterbury branches opened in 1946; the Stamford campus was founded in 1951, the Torrington campus in 1965, and the Avery Point campus in 1967.
