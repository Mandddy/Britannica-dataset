Tapaculo, also spelled Tapacolo,  any of about 55 species of ground-dwelling birds distributed across 12 genera in the family Rhinocryptidae (order Passeriformes) of Central and South America. When disturbed they scurry for cover with tail lifted. Tapaculos are wren- to thrush-sized, with short wings, longish legs, and strong feet for scratching in the earth. Most species are reddish brown or gray, with spots or bars (in both sexes); those of woodlands are darker than those of open scrub country. Tapaculos are detected by their loud ventriloquial calls, usually consisting of clucking, sucking, or gobbling notes. Nesting sites vary widely, from ground burrows to tree holes; some make a ball nest in a bush.
