Baccio Bandinelli,  (born Nov. 12, 1493?, Florence [Italy]—died  Feb. 7, 1560, Florence) Florentine Mannerist sculptor whose Michelangelo-influenced works were favoured by the Medici in the second quarter of the 16th century.
Bandinelli was trained as a goldsmith by his father, Michelangelo di Viviani de’ Bandini, who was patronized by the Medici family. Showing a marked predilection for sculpture, he worked under the sculptor Giovanni Francesco Rustici and became one of the principal artists at the court of the Medicis, grand dukes of Tuscany. He founded an academy for artists in the Vatican (1531) and one in Florence (c. 1550). Accounts of Bandinelli given in Giorgio Vasari’s Lives and in the Autobiography of the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini represent him as jealous, malignant, and untalented. He assumed the surname Bandinelli in 1530.
