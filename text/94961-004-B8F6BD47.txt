Fallow deer (Dama dama), medium-sized deer of the family Cervidae (order Artiodactyla) that is frequently kept on estates, in parks, and in zoos. The common fallow deer (Dama dama dama) is native to the eastern Mediterranean; a second, larger, more brightly coloured, short-antlered form, the Mesopotamian fallow deer (D. dama mesopotamica), is native to Iran. The common fallow deer has been introduced in many areas ever since the Neolithic Period (New Stone Age), and it now occurs wild in Europe and elsewhere and in captivity on deer farms around the world.
The common fallow deer stands about 90 cm (3 feet) at the shoulder; bucks weigh up to 100 kg (220 pounds) and females 45 kg (100 pounds). It prefers open woods where it feeds mainly on herbs and foliage and sometimes on woody browse and grasses. Its coat is usually yellowish brown with white spots in summer and is more uniformly grayish brown in winter. Fallow deer flee from predators by using a form of stiff-legged jumping and running called stotting.
