The university has branch campuses in Staten Island; Manhattan; Oakdale, New York; Rome; and Paris. Total enrollment is approximately 21,000.
The university was founded in 1870. The Vincentians had been invited by the first bishop of Brooklyn, John Loughlin, to establish a college for men in Brooklyn. St. John’s received a new charter in 1906 that elevated the school to university standing. Shortly thereafter it began admitting women, the first of whom graduated in 1913. The School of Law was founded in 1925. The university’s gradual move from Brooklyn to Queens began in 1955. It subsequently established campuses in Staten Island (1971), Rome (1995), Oakdale (1999), Manhattan (2001), and Paris (2008). Former New York governor Mario Cuomo is a graduate of St. John’s.
