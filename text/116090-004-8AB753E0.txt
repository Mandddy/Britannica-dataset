Rocky Mountain National Park, spectacular mountainous region of north-central Colorado, U.S. It lies just west of the town of Estes Park and adjoins Arapaho National Recreation Area, which surrounds two lakes formed by the impounding of the Colorado River, to the southwest; the eastern entrance of the park lies about 70 miles (115 km) northwest of Denver. Established in 1915 and designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1976, the national park has an area of 415 square miles (1,075 square km).
Rocky Mountain National Park includes part of the Front Range, a line of mountains trending north-south that marks the eastern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains. Dozens of peaks exceed 12,000 feet (3,650 metres) in elevation, the highest being Longs Peak at 14,259 feet (4,346 metres). Also notable are the broad glacier-carved valleys and gorges, numerous alpine lakes, and plunging streams. Ice Age glacial deposition is evidenced by meadows and rolling moraines. The Continental Divide runs roughly northwest-southeast through the centre of the park. The source of the Colorado River is in the northwestern corner; the river flows southward along the parkâ€™s western edge and into Arapaho National Recreation Area before turning to the southwest.
