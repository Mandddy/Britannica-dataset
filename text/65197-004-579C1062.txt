Marie Taglioni,  (born April 23, 1804, Stockholm, Sweden—died April 24, 1884, Marseille, France) Italian ballet dancer whose fragile, delicate dancing typified the early 19th-century Romantic style.
Trained chiefly by her father, Filippo Taglioni, she made her debut in Vienna in 1822. In her father’s ballet La Sylphide, introduced at the Paris Opéra, March 12, 1832, she became one of the first women to dance on the extreme tips, or points, of the toes; she created a new style marked by floating leaps, such balanced poses as the arabesque, and a delicate, restrained use of the points.
