Blue Ridge Parkway, scenic motor route, extending 469 miles (755 km) primarily through the Blue Ridge segment of the Appalachian Mountains in the western portions of Virginia and North Carolina, U.S. It links Shenandoah National Park (northeast) with Great Smoky Mountains National Park (southwest) and passes through George Washington and Jefferson (Virginia) and Pisgah and Nantahala (North Carolina) national forests. The parkway, established in 1936, encompasses a total area of 149 square miles (386 square km) and is administered by the U.S. National Park Service (NPS). Headquarters are in Asheville, North Carolina, near the parkwayâ€™s southern terminus.
A proposal to build a private toll road that followed the crest of the Blue Ridge was first put forth in the early 20th century by Joseph Hyde Pratt, a North Carolina geologist. Construction of a segment in North Carolina began in 1912 but ceased after the start of World War I (a short stretch of the present-day parkway follows that route near Linville Falls). Federal interest in a highway to link the two national parks was kindled early in the first administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, which looked on it as a public works project during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After extensive surveying and intense lobbying efforts by interested parties (who recognized the enormous potential for tourism that such a highway represented), the final route was approved by Congress.
