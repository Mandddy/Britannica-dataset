Whinchat,  (Saxicola rubetra), Eurasian thrush named for its habitat: swampy meadows, called, in England, whins. This species, 13 centimetres (5 inches) long, one of the chat-thrush group (family Turdidae, order Passeriformes), is brown-streaked above and buffy below, with white patches on the eyebrows, wings, and tail. It has flycatcher-like habits and a brief, metallic song.
