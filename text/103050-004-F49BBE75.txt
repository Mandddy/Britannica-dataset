OutKast, American rap duo, formed in 1992, that put Atlanta, Ga., on the hip-hop map in the 1990s and redefined the G-Funk (a variation of gangsta rap) and Dirty South (often profane form of hip-hop that emerged in the U.S. South) music styles with their strong melodies, intricate lyrics, and positive messages.
André Lauren Benjamin (byname André 3000; b. May 27, 1975, Atlanta, Ga., U.S.) and Antwan André Patton (byname Big Boi; b. Feb. 1, 1975, Savannah, Ga., U.S.) joined forces at a performing arts high school in Atlanta. Discovering their mutual admiration for hip-hop and the funk musicians that became their stylistic touchstones (Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone, and Prince), they formed a rap group, 2 Shades Deep. Recording in a basement studio under the guidance of the Organized Noize production team (hitmakers for Xscape and TLC), Benjamin and Patton, now known respectively as Dré and Big Boi and collectively as OutKast, had a breakthrough hit single with “Player’s Ball” in 1993.
