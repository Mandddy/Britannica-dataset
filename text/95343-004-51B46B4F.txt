Malay, Malay Orang Melayu (“Malay People”),  any member of an ethnic group of the Malay Peninsula and portions of adjacent islands of Southeast Asia, including the east coast of Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and smaller islands that lie between these areas. The Malays speak various dialects belonging to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family of languages.
The Malays were once probably a people of coastal Borneo who expanded into Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula as a result of their trading and seafaring way of life. That this expansion occurred only in the last 1,500 years or so is indicated by the fact that the languages of the Malay group are all still very much alike though very divergent from the languages of other peoples of Sumatra, Borneo, and other neighbouring lands. In the early 21st century the Malays constituted about half of the population of Peninsular Malaysia (West Malaysia) and about one-eighth of the population of East Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah).
