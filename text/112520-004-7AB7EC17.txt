Alan Greenspan,  (born March 6, 1926, New York City, New York, U.S.) American economist and chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, whose chairmanship (1987â€“2006) continued through the administrations of four American presidents.
At age five Greenspan demonstrated his proficiency in mathematics by reciting baseball batting averages and performing large calculations in his head. As a youth he studied music at the Juilliard School and played jazz saxophone and clarinet in the Henry Jerome band. He went on to study economics at New York University (B.A., 1948; M.A., 1950) and began work on a doctorate at Columbia University under economist and future Federal Reserve Board chairman Arthur F.
