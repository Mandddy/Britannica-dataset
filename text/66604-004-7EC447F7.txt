Muriel Rukeyser,  (born December 15, 1913, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 12, 1980, New York City) American poet whose work focused on social and political problems.
Rukeyser attended private schools and in 1930–32 was a student at Vassar College. During that time she contributed poems to Poetry magazine and other periodicals. She worked on the staff of the Student Review in 1932–33 and later edited the Housatonic, a literary journal. In 1935 her first volume of poems appeared as Theory of Flight in the Yale Younger Poets series. Rukeyser’s travels over the next few years provided material for the poems in Mediterranean (1938), U.S. 1 (1938), and A Turning Wind (1939). Her use of fragmented, emotional imagery is sometimes considered excessive, but her work is noted for its power and acuity. In 1942 she published Willard Gibbs: American Genius, a biography of the 19th-century mathematician and physicist.
