River Avon, also called Lower Avon or Bristol Avon,  river that rises on the southeastern slope of the Cotswolds, England, and flows through Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Somerset. The river shares the name Avon (derived from a Celtic word meaning “river”) with several other rivers in Great Britain, including the Avon of Warwickshire (or Upper Avon) and the Avon of Wiltshire and Hampshire (or East Avon).
With a drainage area of 891 square miles (2,308 square km), it has a fall of more than 500 feet (150 metres) and a length, excluding minor sinuosities, of 75 miles (120 km). It flows eastward and southward in a wide curve through a broad valley, past Chippenham and Melksham, and it turns abruptly westward to Bradford-on-Avon. There the river enters a narrow, gorgelike valley as it swings northwestward through the Cotswolds past Bath. At Bristol the Avon has a straight channel, which was excavated in the 19th century to provide access for seagoing vessels. Below Bristol the river has cut through a limestone ridge to form the picturesque Avon Gorge, which is noted for its wooded cliffs and its suspension bridge. The Avon enters the River Severn estuary at Avonmouth, the ocean port of Bristol. Important tributaries are the Somerset Frome, joining the river from the south near Bradford-on-Avon, and the Bristol Frome, entering from the north in Bristol. The Kennet and Avon Canal (now abandoned) is linked to the river by a ladder of seven locks at Bath.
