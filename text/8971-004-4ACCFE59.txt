Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, in full Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper   (born January 15, 1914, Glanton, Northumberland, England—died January 26, 2003, Oxford, Oxfordshire) British historian and scholar noted for his works on aspects of World War II and on Elizabethan history. He is probably best known as a historian of Adolf Hitler.
Trevor-Roper graduated from Christ Church College, Oxford, in 1936, and in 1939, as a research fellow at Merton College, he qualified for the M.A. degree. His first book was Archbishop Laud, 1573–1645 (1940), a biography of the archbishop of Canterbury and adviser to King Charles I. During World War II, Trevor-Roper was an intelligence officer and helped investigate Hitler’s death. In 1947 his book The Last Days of Hitler was published, and it quickly became a best-seller. From 1946 to 1957 he taught history at Christ Church College. During this period he wrote several articles about Hitler, stirring controversy by contending that Hitler was not only a systematic thinker but a genius as well. In 1957 he was appointed regius professor of modern history and fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. He remained at this post until 1980, when he was appointed Master of Peterhouse College, Cambridge, where he stayed until 1987. He was created a life peer in 1979.
