Nougat,  aerated confection made by mixing nuts and sometimes fruit pieces in a sugar paste whose composition is varied to give either a chewy or a brittle consistency. Nougat originated in Mediterranean countries, where honey, together with almonds or other nuts, was beaten into egg whites and then sun-dried.
In the modern preparation of nougat, honey or sugar and egg albumen are cooked at a temperature below which the albumen coagulates. The resulting mass is then stiffened to the desired degree under heat and combined with hard-cooked sugar and corn syrup. Vegetable fats such as coconut oil are often added to facilitate cutting and biting.
