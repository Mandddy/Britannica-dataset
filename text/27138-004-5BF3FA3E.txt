DC-3, also called Douglas DC-3, Skytrain, C-47 (U.S. Army), R4D (U.S. Navy), or Dakota (Royal Air Force),  transport aircraft, the world’s first successful commercial airliner, readily adapted to military use during World War II. The DC-3, first flown in 1935, was a low-wing twin-engine monoplane that in various conformations could seat 21 or 28 passengers or carry 6,000 pounds (2,725 kg) of cargo. It was over 64 feet (19.5 metres) long, with a wingspan of 95 feet (29 metres). It was manufactured by the Douglas Aircraft Company, Inc.
The DC-3 served, indeed dominated, the infant airline business from its first appearance. In the mid-1940s all but 25 of the 300 airline planes operating in the United States were DC-3s. Its wartime adaptations were simple and effective. It was used to transport passengers (28), fully armed paratroopers (28), wounded troops (18 stretchers and a medical crew of three), military cargo (e.g., two light trucks), and anything else that could fit through its cargo doors and weighed not much more than three tons. A version that carried only troops was called the C-53. The airplane was also used to tow gliders and was even converted to an efficient, high-speed glider by simply removing its engines (and fairing over their empty cowls) and other nonessential weight. As a glider, it could carry 40 fully armed troops at a top towing speed of 290 miles per hour (464 km per hour)—90 mph faster than any previous transport glider and 26 percent faster than its own top speed as a transport airplane.
