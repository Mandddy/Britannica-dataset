Gauge, also spelled gage ,  in manufacturing and engineering, a device used to determine, either directly or indirectly, whether a dimension is larger or smaller than another dimension that is used as a reference standard. Some devices termed gauges may actually measure the size of the object to be gauged, but most gauges merely indicate whether the dimensions of the test object are sufficiently close to those of the standardâ€”i.e., whether they are in the range between set limits, known as the tolerance, for a particular object. Gauges may operate mechanically or electrically.
Gauges are usually regarded as either fixed-type or deviation-type instruments. Fixed-type gauges are used to indicate whether a given dimension is larger or smaller than the standard. They may be of hard steel, soft steel, or glass. Sometimes chrome plating or tungsten-carbide coatings are used to prevent wear.
