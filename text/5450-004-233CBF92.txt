Alderfly,  any insect of the megalopteran family Sialidae, characterized by long, filamentous antennae and two pairs of large wings (anterior wing length 20 to 50 mm [ 3/4 inch to 2 inches]), membranous and well-developed, with part of the hind wing folding like a fan. The adult alderfly is dark-coloured, 15 to 30 mm (3/5 inch to 1 1/5 inches) long, sluggish, and a weak flier. It usually inhabits shore vegetation, especially alder trees.
The aquatic larvae, which have biting jaws and seven or eight pairs of filamentous abdominal gills, crawl along the bottoms of ponds and streams and feed on small insects. Pupae are found in soil and moss. The life cycle is completed in one year.
