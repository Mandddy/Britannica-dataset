Bucharest, Romanian București,  city and municipality, the economic, administrative, and cultural centre of Romania. It lies in the middle of the Romanian plain, on the banks of the Dâmbovița, a small northern tributary of the Danube.
Although archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of settlements dating back to the Neolithic Period, the first written appearance of the name București dates from 1459, when it was recorded in a signed document of Vlad III (the Impaler), the ruler of Walachia. Vlad III built the fortress of Bucharest—the first of many fortifications—with the aim of holding back the Turks who were threatening the existence of the Walachian state.
