Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, American romantic comedy film, released in 1936, that became one of director Frank Capra’s most popular movies. It is noted for its populist theme and for the performances of Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur.
Longfellow Deeds (played by Cooper) is a country rube who, after inheriting a fortune from his uncle, moves to New York City. Once there he gets a lesson in human nature as he is duped and manipulated by supposed allies, including his uncle’s conniving lawyer. Arthur played Babe Bennett, a sharp newspaperwoman who masquerades as a distressed job seeker in order to get close to Deeds so she can write a series of tart-tongued articles about him. When Deeds decides to give his inheritance to the poor and downtrodden victims of the Great Depression, his sanity is questioned. During the trial, he successfully defends himself and discovers that his love for Bennett is mutual.
