Hans E. Kinck, in full Hans Ernst Kinck  (born October 11, 1865, Øksfjord, Norway—died October 13, 1926, Oslo) prolific Norwegian novelist, short-story writer, dramatist, essayist, and Neoromanticist whose works reflect his preoccupation with the past and his lifelong interest in national psychology and creative genius.
The son of a physician and a peasant’s daughter, Kinck spent many years in an isolated valley steeped in folklore, which became a strong interest of his. According to one critic, his sense of society’s dualities—of classes, of cultures, of past and present—came in part from the diversity in his own family. He was educated at King Frederick’s University (now the University of Oslo), Kristiania, where he studied philology and the classics. He married a fellow writer, Minda Ramm.
