Portuguese man-of-war (genus Physalia), any of various jellylike marine animals of the order Siphonophora (class Hydrozoa, phylum Cnidaria) noted for their colonial bodies, floating habit, and powerful sting. The man-of-war is one of the best-known siphonophores.
The man-of-war, although found in warm seas throughout the world, occurs most commonly in the Gulf Stream of the northern Atlantic Ocean and in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans; it is sometimes found floating in groups of thousands. Physalia physalis is the only widely distributed species. P. utriculus, commonly known as the bluebottle, occurs in the Pacific and Indian oceans.
