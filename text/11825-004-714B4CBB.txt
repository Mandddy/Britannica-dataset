André-Hercule de Fleury,  (born June 22, 1653, Lodève, Fr.—died  Jan. 29, 1743, Paris) French cardinal and chief minister who controlled the government of King Louis XV from 1726 to 1743.
The son of a collector of ecclesiastical revenue, Fleury became a priest and eventually almoner to the King in 1683 and bishop of Fréjus in 1698. Shortly before his death in September 1715, Louis XIV appointed Fleury tutor to his five-year-old great-grandson and heir, who succeeded to the throne as Louis XV. In June 1726 Louis XV appointed Fleury minister of state and had him created a cardinal in order to give him precedence in the royal council. Fleury never assumed the title premier ministre (“first minister”), but he was in fact the chief minister of the realm. Ruling with an iron hand, he authorized continuation of the codification of civil law that had begun under Louis XIV and the institution of fiscal reforms that enabled French finances to recover from the costly wars of Louis XIV.
