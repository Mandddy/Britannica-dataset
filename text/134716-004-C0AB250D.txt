Gloria Swanson, original name Gloria May Josephine Svensson   (born March 17, 1899, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—died April 4, 1983, New York, N.Y.) American motion-picture, stage, and television actress known primarily as a glamorous Hollywood star during the 1920s and as the fading movie queen Norma Desmond in the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard.
Swanson was the only child of a civilian official of the U.S. Army transport service, whose work during Swanson’s childhood took the family to Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico. While touring the Essanay film studio during a visit to an aunt in Chicago when she was 14 years old, she asked if she could appear in a crowd scene. She enjoyed the work, stayed on as an extra, and was soon playing bit roles in two-reel comedies. Her parents separated in 1916, and she and her mother moved to Hollywood, where Swanson got a job at the Mack Sennett studio.
