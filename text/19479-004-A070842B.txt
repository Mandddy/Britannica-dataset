Diamond Sutra, Sanskrit Vajraccedika-sutra (“Diamond Cutter Sutra”),  brief and very popular Mahayana Buddhist text widely used in East Asia and perhaps the best known of the 18 smaller “Wisdom” texts that together with their commentaries are known as the Prajnaparamita (“Perfection of Wisdom”). It takes the form of a dialogue in the presence of a company of monks and bodhisattvas (“Buddhas-to-be”) between the Buddha as teacher and a disciple as questioner. The Chinese translation, Jingang jing (“Diamond Sutra”), appeared about 400 ce.
The Diamond Sutra expresses the Prajnaparamita emphasis upon the illusory nature of phenomena in these words: “Just as, in the vast ethereal sphere, stars and darkness, light and mirage, dew, foam, lightning, and clouds emerge, become visible, and vanish again, like the features of a dream—so everything endowed with an individual shape is to be regarded.” As with most of the shorter (and later) Prajnaparamita texts, the ideas are not argued or explained but boldly stated, often in striking paradoxes, including frequent identification of things with their opposites. Thus, the form of presentation underlines the text’s thesis that spiritual realization depends upon transcending rational categories. Partly for this reason the Diamond Sutra is considered the Sanskrit work closest in spirit to the philosophy of Chan (Zen) Buddhism.
