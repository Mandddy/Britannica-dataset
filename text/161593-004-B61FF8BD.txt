Ludacris, byname of Christopher Brian Bridges, also called DJ Chris Lova Lova, also spelled Ludichris  (born September 11, 1977, Champaign, Illinois, U.S.) American rapper who exemplified the Dirty South school of hip-hop, an exuberant, profanity-laden musical style popularized by artists in the southern United States. Ludacris’s magnetic, larger-than-life rapping persona propelled him to stardom.
Though born in Illinois, Chris Bridges spent his formative years in Atlanta, where he later attended Georgia State University. During a stint as a radio disc jockey, he met noted hip-hop producer Timbaland, on whose single “Fat Rabbit” he made his rapping debut in 1998. Adopting the moniker Ludacris (a play on his given name and the word ludicrous), he recorded an independently released debut album, Incognegro (2000). Through word of mouth the album managed to enter the Billboard 200 chart, and Ludacris was soon signed to the record label Def Jam South, which repackaged Incognegro as Back for the First Time (2000). That major label debut ultimately reached number four in the Billboard 200.
