Anglo-Zulu War, also known as Zulu War,  decisive six-month war in 1879 in Southern Africa, resulting in British victory over the Zulus.
During the second half of the 19th century, the British were interested in Zululand for several reasons, including their desire for the Zulu population to provide labour in the diamond fields of Southern Africa, their plan to create a South Africa federation in the region (thereby destroying autonomous African states), and Boer land claims (supported by the British) on territory held by the Zulu kingdom. Cetshwayo, who became king of the Zulus in 1872, was unwilling to submit to British hegemony and assembled a well-disciplined army of 40,000 to 60,000 men. In December 1878 Sir Bartle Frere, British high commissioner for South Africa, issued an ultimatum to Cetshwayo that was designed to be impossible to satisfy: the Zulu were, among other things, to dismantle their “military system” within 30 days and pay reparations for alleged insults. As expected, the ultimatum was not met, and in January 1879 British troops invaded under the leadership of Lord Chelmsford.
