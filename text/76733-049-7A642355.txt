Dressage, (
        French: “training”) systematic and progressive training of riding horses to execute precisely any of a wide range of maneuvers, from the simplest riding gaits to the most intricate and difficult airs and figures of haute école (“high school”). Dressage achieves balance, suppleness, and obedience with the purpose of improving and facilitating the horse’s performance of normal tasks. If the advanced training stage is reached, dressage may become an objective in itself. Competitions in dressage are regularly included in the Olympic Games, for individuals from 1912 and for teams from 1928.
Of great importance to dressage is collection, in which the horse’s gaits are shortened and raised by bringing the balance rearward to lighten the forehand, thus giving special agility in a limited space. This change is made without sacrificing ability to move freely. The desired result is that the horse will be keen but submissive and support the weight of the rider without undue strain on any set of joints or muscles. The overall objectives are to enable the horse to comply easily and willingly with the demands of the rider and at the same time to improve the horse’s pace and bearing.
