Rhinoceros viper (Bitis nasicornis), also called river jack,  brightly coloured venomous snake of the family Viperidae that inhabits rainforests and swamps of West and Central Africa. It prefers wet or damp environments and can even be found on plantations. The body is massive with rough and strongly keeled scales. It possesses a green or blue triangular head with a large black arrowhead mark on the top and two or three pairs of hornlike scales on the tip of the snout. It averages 70–90 cm (28–35 inches) in length, but specimens as long as 1.3 metres (4.3 feet) are known. The body is made up of a spectacular velvetlike pattern of triangles, rectangles, and diamond-shaped areas that are coloured red, yellow, blue, green, and black. The pattern is reminiscent of that of the Gaboon viper; however, the pattern of the rhinoceros viper is more colourful.
The rhinoceros viper is nocturnal and mainly terrestrial; however, it may be found in aquatic environments and in trees at times. Although it is a sluggish and slow-moving snake, it can strike sideways and forward quickly. It hunts prey by waiting in ambush along rodent trails, relying on its cryptic coloration to hide among the leaves of the forest floor. It feeds mostly upon rodents, but it also preys upon frogs and fish. It bears live young (viviparity), giving birth to 6–35 brilliantly coloured young that are 20–25 cm (8–10 inches) long. Although it produces a significant amount of venom, the disposition of this large snake is rather mild, and it rarely bites or causes death in humans. It can produce a prolonged warning exhalation or hiss when disturbed.
