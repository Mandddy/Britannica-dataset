Vairochana, (
        Sanskrit: “Illuminator”) also called Mahavairochana (“Great Illuminator”),  the supreme Buddha, as regarded by many Mahayana Buddhists of East Asia and of Tibet, Nepal, and Java.
Some Buddhists regard Vairochana, or Mahavairochana, as a being separate from the five “self-born” Dhyani-Buddhas, one of whom is known as Vairochana. Among the Shingon sect of Japan, he is the chief object of reverence and is regarded as the source of the entire universe. In Japanese he is called Dainichi Nyorai (“Great Sun Buddha”), or Roshana; in Chinese Piluzhena; in Tibetan Rnam-par-snang-mdzad, or Rnam-snang (“Maker of Brilliant Light”).
