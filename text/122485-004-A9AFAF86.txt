Beelzebub, also called Baalzebub,  in the Bible, the prince of the devils. In the Old Testament, in the form Baalzebub, it is the name given to the god of the Philistine city of Ekron (II Kings 1:1â€“18). Neither name is found elsewhere in the Old Testament, and there is only one reference to it in other Jewish literature. See devil.
