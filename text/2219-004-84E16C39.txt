Lu Mountains, Chinese (Pinyin and Wade-Giles romanization) Lu Shan,  famous mountain area in northern Jiangxi province, southeastern China. Situated to the south of Jiujiang and west of Xingzi, it looks north over the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) valley and east over Lake Poyang. It forms the eastern extremity of the Mufu Mountains. Its highest peak, Dahanyang, is about 4,836 feet (1,474 metres) above sea level. The Lu Mountains were venerated as a holy area from ancient times, when they were called the Kuang Mountains. In early times they were the home of many prominent Buddhists and the intellectual centre of Daoism from the 6th to the 8th century. The Lu Mountains also have associations with many famous poets and literary figures, who referred to them as Kuanglu. Before World War II the mountains still had some 300 temples and Daoist shrines and were a popular summer resort for Western residents of Shanghai and the coastal cities; the area has continued to thrive as a resort. The mountains and surrounding region also have been the subject of geological studies of glaciers of the Quaternary Period (i.e., about the past 2.6 million years).
The Lu massif forms a horst-style fault block that integrates mountains, rivers, and lakes into one unit. It combines a celebrated mountain with beautiful scenery and is renowned worldwide for its grandeur, unusual shape, and elegance. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996, the Lu Mountains scenic area encompasses some 117 square miles (302 square km) and is protected by an outlying zone of 193 square miles (500 square km).
