La Dolce Vita, (
        Italian: “The Sweet Life”) Italian film, released in 1960, that was widely hailed as one of the most important ever made and the first of several acclaimed collaborations between director Federico Fellini and actor Marcello Mastroianni, who came to represent the director’s alter ego.
In La Dolce Vita, Mastroianni portrayed a disillusioned journalist and gossip writer, ashamed of the shallowness of his profession but too weak to remove himself from the nightly temptations it offers: booze, easy women, and exotic fun. Rife with irony and surreal imagery whose meaning may only have been known to the director himself, the film is a compelling indictment of the decadence of modern life, mass consumerism, and what passes for high culture.
