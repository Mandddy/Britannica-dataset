Athens 2004 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Athens that took place August 13–29, 2004. The Athens Games were the 25th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
The 2004 Olympic Games returned home to Greece, birthplace of the ancient Games and site of the inaugural modern Olympics. The excitement surrounding the homecoming was tempered by security concerns related to Athens’s proximity to the politically volatile Middle East. Moreover, serious construction delays and worries that Athens’s hot, humid weather and high levels of air pollution would be detrimental to the athletes prompted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to briefly consider moving the Games to another city. The media seized on these matters and predicted dismal failure. None of the expected calamities occurred. By opening day the city had been splendidly rebuilt. All venues and facilities were ready; exceptionally modern transportation systems functioned well; and security was the best ever. The heat did affect some competitors, and spectator attendance was poor for some of the earlier events (partly as a result of unfavourable press). More than 20 athletes were disqualified after they failed tests for performance-enhancing-drug use, and controversies over scoring in gymnastics and fencing made headlines. Nevertheless, most of the 17-day event went smoothly, and the 35 competition venues were deemed excellent. The world press raved about the success of the Games as it apologized to Greece for its dire but groundless predictions. IOC president Jacques Rogge declared the Athens Olympics “unforgettable, dream Games.”
