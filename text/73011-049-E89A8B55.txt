Sedimentation, in the geological sciences, process of deposition of a solid material from a state of suspension or solution in a fluid (usually air or water). Broadly defined it also includes deposits from glacial ice and those materials collected under the impetus of gravity alone, as in talus deposits, or accumulations of rock debris at the base of cliffs. The term is commonly used as a synonym for sedimentary petrology and sedimentology.
The physics of the most common sedimentation process, the settling of solid particles from fluids, has long been known. The settling velocity equation formulated in 1851 by G.G. Stokes is the classic starting point for any discussion of the sedimentation process. Stokes showed that the terminal settling velocity of spheres in a fluid was inversely proportional to the fluid’s viscosity and directly proportional to the density difference of fluid and solid, the radius of the spheres involved, and the force of gravity. Stokes’ equation is valid, however, only for very small spheres (under 0.04 millimetre [0.0015 inch] in diameter) and hence various modifications of Stokes’ law have been proposed for nonspherical particles and particles of larger size.
