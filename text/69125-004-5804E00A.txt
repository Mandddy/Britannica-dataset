John Elway,  (born June 28, 1960, Port Angeles, Washington, U.S.) American collegiate and professional gridiron football player who is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. He led the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL) to two Super Bowl championships (1998 and 1999).
Elway excelled at football and baseball in high school and was drafted by major league baseball’s Kansas City Royals in 1979. However, he instead attended Stanford University (B.A., 1983) on a football scholarship, where he set several school and conference passing records. He was the number one draft pick of baseball’s New York Yankees in 1981, and he played for a Yankees farm club over the following summer. In 1983 Elway was chosen by the Baltimore Colts as the first overall pick in the NFL draft, but he threatened to play baseball professionally if the struggling Colts did not trade him. The Colts complied, and Elway was dealt to the Broncos, where he spent his entire 16-year career.
