Skibobbing, also called skibiking or snowbiking,  a winter sport using a guidable, single-track vehicle that has features of the bicycle, the bobsled, and skis. The longer rear ski is fixed, and the shorter front ski is mobile for steering; a saddle like that of a bicycle and a steering bar with handles complete the rig. The assembly is kept flexible to provide smooth passage over bumps and is lightweight, made of wood, aluminum, or plastic for portability. The skibob measures 1.9 to 2.29 metres (6.2 to 7.5 feet) in length. The rider wears short skis and a helmet, but goggles are optional.
The first skiboblike device was patented in the United States in 1892 and an Austrian device in 1902. Swiss mailmen and delivery boys used the device, but the sport did not develop until after World War II. In 1948 the German Georg Gefäller manufactured the Gefäller Ei (“Gefäller Egg”), which he called a skibob. The sport slowly became international as it spread from Austria to Switzerland, West Germany, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia and then from Europe to the United States, Canada, Japan, and elsewhere.
