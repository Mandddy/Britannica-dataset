Norwegian literature, the body of writings by the Norwegian people.
The roots of Norwegian literature reach back more than 1,000 years into the pagan Norse past. In its evolution Norwegian literature was closely intertwined with Icelandic literature and with Danish literature. Only after the separation of Norway from Denmark in 1814 is it possible to point to a literature that is unambiguously Norwegian. This article focuses on literature produced from the 16th century onward by writers of Norwegian birth in Bokmål (Dano-Norwegian; also called Riksmål) and, later, Nynorsk (New Norwegian). Because Norwegian literature and Icelandic literature are often indistinguishable in their earliest forms, both are discussed together under Icelandic literature. Writers of Norwegian birth who produced works in Danish are discussed both in this article and under Danish literature.
