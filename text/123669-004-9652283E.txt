Milwaukee County Zoo, in full Milwaukee County Zoological Gardens,  scenic zoo located on the outskirts of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S. The zoo, founded in 1892, was originally situated closer to the centre of the city but was relocated to its present 200-acre (80-hectare) site in 1958. It receives financial support from a local zoological society. The zoo has some 2,500 specimens representing about 300 species. Many of the animals are exhibited in barless moated enclosures, which are positioned in such a way that natural predators and their prey (e.g., lions and zebras, and tigers and deer) seem to be housed together. Many of the displays are arranged according to the animalsâ€™ geographic area of origin. The zoo has an aviary and special features such as a sea lion show.
