Rose window, also called wheel window,  in Gothic architecture, decorated circular window, often glazed with stained glass. Scattered examples of decorated circular windows existed in the Romanesque period (Santa Maria in Pomposa, Italy, 10th century). Only toward the middle of the 12th century, however, did the idea appear of making a rich decorative motif out of a round window. At this time the simple rose window became a distinguishing characteristic of many transitional and early Gothic churches. It was used mainly at the west end of the nave and the ends of the transepts. The introduction of developed bar tracery in the 13th century gave a compelling impetus to rose window design.
The general scheme of a rose windowâ€™s tracery consisted of a series of radiating forms, each of which was tipped by a pointed arch at the outside of the circle. The bars between these forms were joined at the centre by a pierced circle of stone, and the forms themselves frequently were treated like little traceried windows with subsidiary, subdividing bars, arches, and foiled circles. The major examples of this High Gothic type are largely French, in which the rose window achieved its greatest medieval popularity. Those of the cathedrals of Reims, Amiens, and Notre-Dame at Paris, all of the 13th century, are particularly noteworthy.
