Ader Avion III, monoplane designed, built, and first tested by the French aeronautical pioneer Clément Ader in 1897. For a table of pioneer aircraft, see history of flight.
In 1892 the French Ministry of War commissioned Ader to begin work on a new airplane, a tractor monoplane powered by twin 20-horsepower Ader steam engines that he completed in 1897. Like his earlier Ader Éole, the Avion III featured deeply cambered wings shaped like those of a bat. Even the propeller blades resembled gigantic quill feathers. The pilot was provided with foot pedals to control both the rudder and the rear wheels of the three-wheeled undercarriage and a means of operating the propellers at differing speeds. Twenty or 30 turns of a large crank in the cockpit enabled the pilot to change the position of the wings. Knowledgeable aviators who inspected the machine in later years did not believe that the control system would have been effective in flight.
