Melina Mercouri,  (born Oct. 18, 1925, Athens, Greece—died  March 6, 1994, New York, N.Y., U.S.) Greek actress and political activist who was the minister of culture in her country’s first socialist government (1981).
Mercouri came from a politically prominent family. She graduated from the Drama School of the National Theatre of Greece. Her first major role, at the age of 20, was Lavinia in Eugene O’Neill’s Mourning Becomes Electra, but perhaps her most memorable parts were Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire and the good-hearted prostitute in the film Never on Sunday (1960). This film gained her an international reputation that would serve her well in politics. Her involvement in politics was triggered by her indignation over the military coup that brought a handful of army colonels to power in Greece in 1967.
