John Peter Altgeld,  (born December 30, 1847, Selters, Nassau [now in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany]—died March 12, 1902, Joliet, Illinois, U.S.) reformist Democratic governor of Illinois (1893–97) known principally for his pardon (June 26, 1893) of German-American anarchists involved in the Haymarket Riot, a labour protest meeting in which seven Chicago policemen were killed at Haymarket Square on May 4, 1886.
Altgeld’s German parents immigrated to Ohio, where he was reared. In the 1870s he moved to Chicago, where he soon accumulated a small fortune in real estate. He early revealed his sympathy for the poor in a small treatise on crime, Our Penal Machinery and Its Victims (1884). He entered Democratic politics and was elected to the superior court of Cook county (1886–91). Associating himself with the public demand for reform legislation, he won his party’s nomination for governor (1892) and was elected by the farm and labour vote.
