Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, U.S. satellite, launched June 11, 2008, that was designed to study gamma ray-emitting sources. These sources are the universeâ€™s most violent and energetic objects and include gamma-ray bursts, pulsars, and high-speed jets emitted by black holes. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is the lead agency, with contributions by France, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Sweden.
Fermi carries two instruments, the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), which work in the energy range of 10 keV to 300 GeV (10,000 to 300,000,000,000 electron volts) and are based on highly successful predecessors that flew on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) in the 1990s. Unlike visible light or even X-rays, gamma rays cannot be focused with lenses or mirrors. Therefore, the main detectors of the LAT are made of silicon and tungsten strips at right angles to each other. Gamma rays produce electron-positron pairs that then ionize material in the strips. The ionized charge is proportional to the strength of the gamma ray. The arrangement of the strips helps determine the direction of the incoming radiation. Cosmic rays are far more common than gamma rays, but the LAT has materials that interact with cosmic rays only and with both cosmic rays and gamma rays, so cosmic rays can be distinguished and ignored. In its first 95 hours of operation, the LAT produced a map of the entire sky; CGRO took years to produce a similar map.
