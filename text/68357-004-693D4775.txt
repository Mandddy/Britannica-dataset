Henri Farman,  (born 1874, Paris, Franceâ€”died  July 18, 1958, Paris) French aviation pioneer and aircraft builder who popularized the use of ailerons, moveable surfaces on the trailing edge of a wing that provide a means of lateral control.
Farman, the son of British citizens living in France, was first a painter, then a racing motorist. With his brother, Maurice Farman, he modified a Voisin pusher biplane, now known as the Voisin-Farman I, and in January 1908 won an important prize for the first circular flight of 1 km (0.6 mile). In 1909 he set a world record for endurance with a flight of 234.3 km (145.59 miles) in the Farman III. In 1912 the Farman brothers established a factory at Boulogne-sur-Seine, where they produced classic pusher biplanes for military and training purposes. The 1914 model was widely employed for reconnaissance and observation.
