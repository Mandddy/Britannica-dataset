Land crab,  any crab of the family Gecarcinidae (order Decapoda of the class Crustacea), typically terrestrial, square-bodied crabs that only occasionally, as adults, return to the sea. They occur in tropical America, West Africa, and the Indo-Pacific region. All species feed on both animal and plant tissue. Cardisoma guanhumi, a land crab of Bermuda, the West Indies, and the southern United States, lives in fields, swamps, and mangrove thickets. Some penetrate inland as far as 8 km (about 5 miles). Adults weigh about 0.5 kg (18 ounces) and measure about 11 cm (4 inches) across the carapace, or back. Gecarcinus lateralis, occurring from Bermuda to Guyana, is 9 cm wide. Like Cardisoma, it may live a considerable distance from the ocean.
