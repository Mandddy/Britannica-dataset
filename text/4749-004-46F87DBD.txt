Tree snake, any of a number of arboreal serpents, primarily of the family Colubridae. They prey on birds and on arboreal lizards and frogs. The green tree snakes of northern South America and Central America include the slender, broad-headed members of the genus Thalerophis and the parrotsnakes (Leptophis). Another tropical American genus is Imantodes, made up of exceptionally slender rear-fanged tree snakes that stiffen the body in the shape of an I-beam to cross from branch to branch. A well-known genus found from Southeast Asia to Australia is Dendrophis,. The most common of Australiaâ€™s few colubrid snakes is the green tree snake Dendrelaphis punctulatus, found in the northern and eastern regions. It has a tiny head, thin foreparts and may reach a length of 1.8 metres (5.9 feet). Flying snakes, mangrove snakes, vine snakes, and whip snakes are sometimes called tree snakes.
