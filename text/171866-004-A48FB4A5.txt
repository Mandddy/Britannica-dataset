Percy MacKaye,  (born March 16, 1875, New York City, New York, U.S.â€”died August 31, 1956, Cornish, New Hampshire) American poet and playwright whose use of historical and contemporary folk literature furthered the development of the pageant in the U.S.
MacKaye was introduced to the theatre at an early age by his father, actor Steele MacKaye, with whom he first collaborated. Graduating from Harvard University in 1897, he studied abroad for two years and returned to the United States to write and lecture. In 1912 he published The Civic Theatre, in which he advocated amateur community theatricals. He attempted to bring poetry and drama to large participant groups and to unite the stage arts, music, and poetry by the use of masques and communal chanting. He wrote, among others, the pageants The Canterbury Pilgrims (published in 1903) and, as co-author, St. Louis: A Civic Masque (performed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1914 with 7,500 participants).
