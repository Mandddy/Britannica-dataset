Lance missile, U.S.-made mobile short-range ballistic missile, capable of carrying either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, that was developed during the 1960s and fielded by the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1992, mainly in western Europe. Lance missiles also were sold for use by several member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as by Israel.
The Lance was about 20 feet (6 metres) long and was launched from a modified M113 armoured personnel carrier. It was propelled by a liquid-fueled rocket engine to a maximum range of about 75 miles (120 km). Lance missiles were deployed in NATO armies at the corps level and were intended to attack Soviet and Warsaw Pact armoured units and installations beyond artillery range. The missile could deliver conventional high-explosive warheads or cluster bomblets. Under U.S. control or joint control between the United States and a NATO ally, missiles were fitted with an atomic warhead with a yield of up to 100 kilotons. An enhanced-radiation, or “neutron,” thermonuclear warhead was designed for U.S. missiles but was never deployed.
