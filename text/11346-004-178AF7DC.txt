Pierre-Narcisse, Baron Guérin,  (born March 13, 1774, Paris—died  July 16, 1833, Rome) French painter and the teacher of both Eugène Delacroix and Théodore Géricault. He won the Prix de Rome in 1797 and had an early success with his topical “Return of Marcus Sextus” (1799; Louvre, Paris).
“Phèdre et Hippolyte” (1802; Louvre) and “Andromaque et Pyrrhus” (1810; Louvre) are melodramatic, highly calculated pieces. His best painting, the only one to show feeling for colour and atmosphere, is “Enée racontant à Didon les malheurs de la ville de Troie” (1817; Louvre). He was director of the Académie de France in Rome from 1822 to 1828.
