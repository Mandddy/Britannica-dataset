Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, worldwide organizations for girls, dedicated to training them in citizenship, good conduct, and outdoor activities. Robert (later Lord) Baden-Powell founded the Girl Guides in Great Britain in 1910 in response to the requests of girls who were interested in the Boy Scout movement established by him in 1908. The first Girl Scout troop in the United States was formed in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Low of Savannah, Georgia, and followed the pattern set up for the Girl Guides; the organization later adopted the name Girl Scouts of the United States of America. Other countries subsequently adopted Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting programs, and the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts was formed in 1928. A century after the association’s founding, there were an estimated 10 million Girl Guides and Girl Scouts worldwide.
Aims and activities are substantially the same in all countries in which the movement is organized. The girls promise to follow a code of behaviour, undertake community service projects, and try to develop their skills by earning proficiency badges in a wide variety of activities including outdoor recreation, writing, cooking, performing arts, first aid, and finance—the latter often revolving around the annual fund-raising sale of cookies, for which Girl Scouts and Girl Guides are best known to many. Badge and uniform types vary by country and are often determined by age group.
