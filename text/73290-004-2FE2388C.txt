Bernard Cardinal Law, original name in full Bernard Francis Law  (born November 4, 1931, Torreón, Mexico) American prelate who was head (1984–2002) of the archdiocese of Boston.
Law’s father was a U.S. Army colonel and his mother a concert pianist. He attended high school in the U.S. Virgin Islands. After graduating from Harvard University with a degree in history, he studied for the priesthood and was ordained in 1961. His initial assignment was in Natchez, Mississippi, the poorest diocese in the United States. An outspoken supporter of civil rights, he received death threats for the views he expressed while serving as editor of the weekly newspaper of the diocese of Natchez-Jackson. In 1968 Law went to Washington, D.C., to serve as executive director of the American bishops’ Committee on Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs. Five years later he was named bishop of the diocese of Springfield–Cape Girardeau in southern Missouri. As head of that diocese, he opened the first home for battered women in Springfield and set up a centre for Vietnamese refugees that became a national model.
