Marantaceae, the prayer plant family of the ginger order (Zingiberales), composed of about 31 genera and 550 species of rhizomatous perennial herbs that are native to moist or swampy tropical forests, particularly in the Americas but also in Africa and Asia. Members of the Marantaceae vary from plants with slender, reedlike stalks to leafy spreading herbs to dense bushes nearly 2 m (about 6.5 feet) high.
The smooth white rhizomes (underground stems) of some species, such as Maranta arundinacea, furnish the starch known as arrowroot. Other members of the family are popular ornamentals, such as the prayer plant (M. leuconeura kerchoveana), the water canna (Thalia dealbata), and species of the genus Calathea. The leaves of some species are used in basket weaving. Calathea species produce wax, and some have edible flowers and tubers. See also prayer plant.
