Iapetus, outermost of Saturn’s major regular moons, extraordinary because of its great contrast in surface brightness. It was discovered by the Italian-born French astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini in 1671 and named for one of the Titans of Greek mythology.
Iapetus has a radius of 718 km (446 miles) and orbits Saturn once every 79.3 Earth days at a distance of 3,561,300 km (2,212,900 miles). Its bulk density of 1.0 grams per cubic cm implies that it must be made mostly of ices. The closer moons of Saturn orbit within roughly one degree of Saturn’s equatorial plane, but, at Iapetus’s orbit and beyond, the gravitational influence of Saturn’s equatorial bulge becomes less important, permitting larger orbital inclinations. It has been suggested that Iapetus’s 15° average inclination is a relic of the tilt of the long-vanished gaseous disk from which Saturn’s major regular moons formed.
