Sir William Chambers,  (born  Feb. 23, 1723, Gothenburg, Swed.—died  March 8, 1796, London, Eng.) British eclectic architect of the Georgian period who was one of the leading Palladian-style architects of his day.
He was the son of a merchant of Scottish descent living in Sweden. At age 16, after education in England, Chambers entered the service of the Swedish East India Company. A voyage to Canton supplied the materials for his Designs of Chinese Buildings (1757). In 1749 he studied architecture, first in Paris with the influential architectural theorist Jacques-François Blondel and then in Rome. Returning to England in 1755, he became architectural tutor to the prince of Wales, the future George III. This appointment led to an extremely successful career as an official architect. He helped found the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768 and was its first treasurer in 1768. Upon receiving the knighthood of the Polar Star from the king of Sweden, he was allowed by George III to assume the rank and title of an English knight.
