Robert Esnault-Pelterie, in full Robert-Albert-Charles Esnault-Pelterie  (born Nov. 8, 1881, Paris, France—died Dec. 6, 1957, Nice) French aviation pioneer who made important contributions to the beginnings of heavier-than-air flight in Europe.
After studying engineering at the Sorbonne in Paris, Esnault-Pelterie built his first glider, a very rough copy of the Wright glider of 1902 but constructed without an understanding of the Wright brothers’ control system. As a result, he abandoned the attempt to fly the glider with a wing-warping system and became the first flying-machine pioneer to make use of ailerons, moveable surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing, to maintain lateral control. In 1907 Esnault-Pelterie designed and built a pioneer monoplane powered by an innovative seven-cylinder radial engine with which he made flights of up to 600 metres (about 2,000 feet). His later models, R.E.P. No. 2 and R.E.P. No. 2-bis, included several innovations, such as hydraulic brakes.
