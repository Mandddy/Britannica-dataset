Thomas Howard, 3rd duke of Norfolk,  (born 1473â€”died August 25, 1554, Kenninghall, Norfolk, England) powerful English noble who held a variety of high offices under King Henry VIII. Although he was valuable to the king as a military commander, he failed in his aspiration to become the chief minister of the realm.
Howard was the brother-in-law of King Henry VII and the son of Thomas Howard, 2nd duke of Norfolk. In May 1513 he became lord high admiral, and on September 9 he helped rout the Scots at Flodden Field near Branxton, Northumberland. He became lord deputy of Ireland in 1520 but soon left this post to command a fleet against the French.
