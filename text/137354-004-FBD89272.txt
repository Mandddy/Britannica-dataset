Horseradish tree, also called drumstick tree,  (Moringa oleifera), small, deciduous tree, of the family Moringaceae, native to tropical Asia but also naturalized in Africa and tropical America. Horseradish trees can reach a height of about 9 metres (30 feet); they have corky gray bark, much-divided, fernlike leaves, and scented clusters of white pealike flowers. The angled daggerlike fruits sometimes grow to 45 cm (18 inches) long. Flowers, pods, leaves, and even twigs are cooked and eaten. A horseradish-flavoured condiment is prepared from the crushed roots. Ben oil, extracted from the seeds, is used by watchmakers. Perfume makers value it for its retention of scents.
