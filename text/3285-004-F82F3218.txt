Oystershell scale (Lepidosaphes ulmi), a species of insect in the armoured scale family, Diaspididae (order Homoptera), that is found on woody plants and secretes a hard, tough protective covering that resembles a miniature oystershell. Despite its small size, the oystershell scale can inflict great damage on the trees and shrubs on which it lives. Control is by dormant, or horticultural, oil spray and natural enemies such as birds, mites, and parasitic wasps.
The life histories of the oystershell scale, as well as the size and colour of the cover of the adult female, vary according to the host. The oystershell scale is found on lilacs, beeches, maples, willows, and many ornamentals. The oystershell scale occurs in almost every state in the United States and was probably introduced from Europe.
