Qu Yuan, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’ü Yüan  (born c. 339 bce, Quyi [now Zigui, Hubei province], China—died 278 bce, Hunan) one of the greatest poets of ancient China and the earliest known by name. His highly original and imaginative verse had an enormous influence over early Chinese poetry.
Qu Yuan was born a member of the ruling house of Chu, a large state in the central valley of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang). While still in his 20s he was appointed a trusted, favoured counselor of his kinsman Huaiwang, the ruler of Chu. Qu Yuan advocated the unpopular policy of resistance to Qin, the most powerful of the Warring States, causing his rival courtiers to intrigue successfully against him. Estranged from the throne through the malice of his rivals, Qu Yuan was banished to the south of the Yangtze River by Huaiwang’s successor, Qingxiangwang.
