Stora Sjöfallet National Park, national park in northwestern Sweden. The park was established in 1909 and is located immediately north of Sarek National Park, near the Norwegian border. The park’s name, meaning “great waterfall,” refers to Stora Falls, the falls in the upper Lule River that plunge 130 feet (40 metres) over a rocky crest. The park is an extensively mountainous and glacial region divided longitudinally by other large lakes, including Lake Akkaj, which forms a reservoir for the Porjus power station downstream from the falls. There is an extensive variety of tundra and woodland vegetation and wildlife in the park.
