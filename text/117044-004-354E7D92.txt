Ruff (Philomachus pugnax), in zoology, Old World bird of the sandpiper subfamily Calidritinae (family Scolopacidae, order Charadriiformes) remarkable for its unusual courtship plumage and behaviour. The name ruff applies to the species or may be applied to the male only. In spring the 30-cm (12-inch) male acquires a double crest (“cape”) and a collar (“ruff”); these may contain reddish, brown, black, and white feathers in proportions that vary with the individual. (This is the most extreme case of polymorphism known among birds.) The female, called the reeve, is only about 25 cm (10 inches) long and is plain grayish brown, as is the male in winter.
In the breeding season, males gather on a traditional display area (lek), usually a bare hill, and, while the reeves watch, display close together by making short rushes with cape and ruff erect and wings drooping. During the silent courtship dance, males may raise head tufts, leap into the air, bow, crouch, and stand tall. Two social classes of males are evident during the display. Resident males have black, brown, or patterned ruffs. They share their lek territories with subordinate more-conspicuous males that have white ruffs. The lighter subordinate males help attract females to the territories of the resident males. While the aggressive resident male is busy defending his area of the lek, the subordinate male sometimes “steals” copulations with visiting females. This behaviour is genetically inherited along with the coloration of the male.
