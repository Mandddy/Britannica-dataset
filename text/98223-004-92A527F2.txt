Puffy AmiYumi, Japanese popular music (commonly called J-pop) group that skyrocketed to stardom in Japan in the mid-1990s and later helped to establish J-pop in the Western world. The group’s two lead singers—Ami Onuki (b. Sept. 18, 1973, Tokyo, Japan) and Yumi Yoshimura (b. Jan. 30, 1975, Osaka, Japan)—captured their audiences through their well-blended voices, their intelligent lyrics and novel musical arrangements, and their vibrant, youthful stage presence.
Puffy AmiYumi was formed in 1995 when the Sony Corporation began a talent search for two appealing young women to form a pop duo that would be a hit with schoolgirls. Tokyo native Ami Onuki was selected after she submitted a demo tape in response to an advertisement. Yumi Yoshimura of Osaka was discovered by a talent agency. The two had a unique chemistry from the start, both personally and vocally. Both women credited Okuda Tamio, a respected Japanese singer-songwriter and producer, for mentoring them through the early stages of their joint career. In 1996 they released their first single, “Asia no junshin” (“True Asia”), which was a huge hit throughout Asia. The single was soon followed by their debut album, AmiYumi.
