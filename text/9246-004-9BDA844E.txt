Flavius Stilicho,  (born ad 365—died  Aug. 22, 408) regent (394–408) for the Roman emperor Honorius and one of the last great Roman military commanders in the West. He fought in several campaigns against the barbarians, opposing the invading Visigoths under Alaric in the Balkans and Italy and repelling an Ostrogothic invasion of Italy in 406.
Stilicho was half-Roman, half-Vandal by birth. Making the army his career, in 383 he served on an embassy to the Persian king Shāpūr III, afterward marrying Serena, the favourite niece of the emperor Theodosius. He was appointed count of the domestics (commanding the Emperor’s household troops) c. 385 and then, in or before 393, master of both services (i.e., commander in chief of the army), an office he held until his death.
