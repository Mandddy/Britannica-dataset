Rock Hudson, original name Roy Harold Scherer, Jr., later Roy Fitzgerald  (born November 17, 1925, Winnetka, Illinois, U.S.—died October 2, 1985, Beverly Hills, California) American actor noted for his good looks and movie roles during the 1950s and ’60s and popular television series in the 1970s. A popular actor of modest talent, Hudson was one of the first known Hollywood celebrities to die of AIDS-related complications; the extensive publicity surrounding his death drew attention to the disease.
After serving in the navy during World War II, Roy Fitzgerald went to Hollywood in 1946 to pursue an acting career. He found work as a truck driver but spent his spare time idling outside of studio gates and sending photographs of himself to various producers. In 1947 talent scout Henry Willson took an interest in him and invented a new name for his protégé: Rock Hudson—Rock for the Rock of Gibraltar and Hudson for the Hudson River. Despite a number of initial setbacks, owing to a complete lack of training as an actor, Hudson signed with Warner Brothers and played his first role in Fighter Squadron (1948). A year later, his contract was purchased by Universal Pictures, which provided him with some much-needed acting lessons.
