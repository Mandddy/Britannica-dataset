George Cukor, in full George Dewey Cukor  (born July 7, 1899, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 24, 1983, Los Angeles, California) American motion-picture director who produced films of high quality for 50 years, combining his skill in working with actors, especially actresses, and his careful attention to details.
Cukor was born in Manhattan to a family of Hungarian Jewish descent. He took an early interest in the theatre and began his professional show-business career in 1919 as a stage manager of a theatre troupe in Chicago. In the early 1920s he spent summers in Rochester, New York, as the resident director of his own stock company and worked winters on Broadway in New York City, where he directed the first stage production of The Great Gatsby in 1926. After moving to Los Angeles in 1929, he became the dialogue director for Lewis Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). Under contract to Paramount, Cukor codirected three films before receiving his first solo directorial credit, for Tarnished Lady (1931), a glossy melodrama featuring stage star Tallulah Bankhead. After directing Girls About Town (1931), he replaced Ernst Lubitsch (who had taken ill) as the director of the Jeanette MacDonald–Maurice Chevalier musical romance One Hour with You (1932), only to have Lubitsch return and take over. When Lubitsch ended up with the director credit over Cukor’s objections, Cukor left Paramount to join RKO and producer David O. Selznick, whom he had known in New York. There he made What Price Hollywood? (1932), which established the template for William Wellman’s A Star Is Born (1937) and its remakes (including Cukor’s 1954 version). Constance Bennett starred as a waitress who rises to acting stardom while her alcoholic mentor plummets into disgrace. A Bill of Divorcement (1932) followed but was notable only as the film debut of Katharine Hepburn, with whom Cukor would collaborate nine more times.
