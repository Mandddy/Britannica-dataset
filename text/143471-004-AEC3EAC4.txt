Romário, byname of Romário de Souza Faria  (born January 29, 1966, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) Brazilian football (soccer) player who was one of the most prolific goal scorers in the sport’s history. He won the Golden Ball as the most outstanding performer in the 1994 World Cup after helping Brazil win the tournament.
Romário was raised in Villa Pena, a Rio de Janeiro suburb. It was not until his father took him along to see the Olaria football club that any thoughts of a career in professional sports emerged. He signed with Olaria’s youth squad at age 13 and developed rapidly. In a friendly match against Vasco da Gama he scored four times, a feat that persuaded Vasco to sign him in 1985. Romário won two state championships with the team and scored 73 goals in 123 matches over four seasons. Selected for the Brazilian team that competed at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, he was the leading goal scorer in the competition, and Brazil took the silver medal. In 1989 Brazil won the Copa América, with Romário scoring the only goal in the final against Uruguay.
