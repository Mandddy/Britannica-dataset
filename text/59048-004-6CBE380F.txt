Don River, one of the great rivers of the European portion of Russia. It has been a vital artery in Russian history since the days of Peter I the Great, who initiated a hydrographic survey of its course. Throughout the world the river is associated with images of the turbulent and colourful Don Cossacks—romanticized in a famous series of novels by the 20th-century Russian writer Mikhail Sholokhov—and with a series of large-scale engineering projects that have enhanced the waterway’s economic importance.
The Don River rises in the small reservoir of Shat, located in the Central Russian Upland near the city of Novomoskovsk. It flows generally in a southerly direction for a total distance of 1,162 miles (1,870 kilometres), draining a basin of some 163,000 square miles (422,000 square kilometres), before it enters the Gulf of Taganrog in the Sea of Azov. It lies between the Volga River to the east and the Dnieper River to the west. In its middle and lower courses, from the confluence with the Chornaya Kalitva River to its mouth, the Don forms an enormous eastward-bulging arc as far as its junction with the Ilovlya River. Near the top of the arc, the vast Tsimlyansk Reservoir begins. The Volga–Don Ship Canal stretches from the upper part of the reservoir to the Volga, which at that point is a mere 50 miles distant.
