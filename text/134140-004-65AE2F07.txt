Ashikaga Yoshimitsu,  (born Sept. 25, 1358, Kyōto, Japan—died  May 31, 1408, Kyōto) shogun (hereditary military dictator) of Japan, who achieved political stability for the Ashikaga shogunate, which had been established in 1338 by his grandfather, Ashikaga Takauji. The period of this shogunate’s rule (until 1573) subsequently became known as the Muromachi period after the district of Kyōto in which Yoshimitsu lived.
Proclaimed shogun in 1368, Yoshimitsu, in contrast to his father and grandfather, assumed an active role in the imperial bureaucracy. In 1381 he became inner minister, later advancing to the position of minister of the left and, in 1394, minister of state. By the end of his reign he had accomplished a complete reorganization of the civil government.
