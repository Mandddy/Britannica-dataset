Inoue Kaoru, in full (from 1907) Kōshaku (Marquess) Inoue Kaoru  (born Jan. 16, 1835, Nagato province [now in Yamaguchi prefecture], Japan—died  Sept. 1, 1915, Tokyo) one of the elder statesmen (genro) who ruled Japan during the Meiji period (1868–1912).
Inoue was born to a samurai family of the Chōshū clan of western Japan and was a close boyhood friend of Itō Hirobumi, who later became Japan’s first prime minister. Both wished to rid Japan of foreigners, and they joined an attack on the British legation in Edo (now Tokyo). When this failed they became aware of Japan’s powerlessness and decided to study the foreigners firsthand. The two left Japan in 1863 and worked their way to England as ordinary sailors. The following year, when news reached them of a crisis in Japan after their clan had bombarded foreign ships in the Shimonoseki Strait, they hurried home to urge their clansmen and others to seek peace. They failed in this effort, and Inoue was attacked and injured by reactionary samurai.
