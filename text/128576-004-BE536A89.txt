Boxwood (family Buxaceae), also called box,  any of the plants in the family Buxaceae (order Buxales), best known for the ornamental and useful boxwoods. The boxwood family comprises five genera of trees, shrubs, and herbs and is native to North America, Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Flowers are small, unisexual, and without petals, and the majority of species are dioecious (bearing male and female flowers on separate plants). The leathery evergreen leaves are simple and alternately arranged along the stems. Fruits are one- or two-seeded capsules or drupes (stony-pitted fleshy fruits).
Three species of the genus Buxus provide the widely grown boxwood: the common, or American, box (B. sempervirens), the Japanese box (B. microphylla), and the Korean box (B. sinica). See also boxwood.
