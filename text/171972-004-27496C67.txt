Peter Pindar, pseudonym of John Wolcot  (baptized May 9, 1738, Dodbrooke, Devonshire, England—died January 14, 1819, London) English writer of a running commentary in satirical verse on society, politics, and personalities, 1778–1817.
After studying medicine at Aberdeen, Scotland, Wolcot went to Jamaica as physician to the governor in 1767. He was ordained in 1769 but then forsook the church. He returned to England in 1772 and practiced medicine in Cornwall until he settled in London in 1781. Despite blindness, he continued to write to the end of his life, producing more than 70 satirical works and some other poems. He was buried, at his own request, “close to the author of Hudibras,” the 17th-century satirist Samuel Butler, in St. Paul’s Covent Garden, London.
