The municipality is a regional city complex made up of five major towns: Zhangdian (Zibo), Linzi, Zhoucun, Zichuan, and Boshan. Each is now a district of the municipality. Zhangdian, in the north-central part of the municipality, is its administrative seat. Linzi constitutes the eastern district and Zhoucun the western. Stretching to the south are Zichuan and Boshan; the name Zibo was coined by combining the first character of each of these names. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 1,519,276; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 3,061,000.
Of the five towns, Linzi was the first to begin developing. Rich with farm produce and other resources, it was on the earliest east-west trunk road constructed at the foot of the northern slopes of the mountains in central Shandong. It served as the capital of the Qi state during the Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu; 770–476 bce) and the Warring States (Zhanguo; 475–221 bce) periods. Zhoucun, west of Zhangdian, developed into a trading centre famous for its silks and silk products.
