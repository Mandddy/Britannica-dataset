Red River, Vietnamese Song Hong, Chinese Yüan Chiang,  principal river of northern Vietnam. It rises in central Yunnan province, southwestern China, and flows southeast in a deep, narrow gorge, across the Tonkin region, through Hanoi, to enter the Gulf of Tonkin after a course of 750 miles (1,200 km). Its two major tributaries, the Song Lo (Rivière Claire, or Clear River) on the left bank and the Black River (Rivière Noire, or Song Da) on the right, boost the flow of water, which during the rainy season may reach 335,500 cubic feet (9,500 cubic metres) per second. The Red River has a very irregular volume throughout the year and carries huge quantities of silt because of the large proportion of easily crumbled soil in its basin, especially in the red lands from which its name derives. This material is deposited in the river’s delta, a flat triangular region of about 2,700 square miles (7,000 square km) that extends 93 miles (150 km) inland and 50 miles (80 km) along the coast. The delta constitutes a large part of northern Vietnam and is densely populated and intensively cultivated. Haiphong, the outport of Hanoi, is on a northern arm of the delta.
