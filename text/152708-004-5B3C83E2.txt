Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), also called ringed penguin or bearded penguin,  species of penguin (order Sphenisciformes) characterized by a cap of black plumage on the top of the head, a white face, and a fine, continuous band of black feathers that extends from one side of the head to the other across each cheek and under the chin. The common name of the species derives from the presence of this “chinstrap” of black feathers. Other distinguishing features include a fine ring of black skin around each eye and a black bill. The species inhabits the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula and several Antarctic and subantarctic islands. The largest concentrations of these birds are found in breeding colonies along the coasts of the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands, and the South Sandwich Islands. Breeding colonies also occur on the Antarctic Peninsula and on the Balleny Islands between Antarctica and New Zealand.
Adults average 71–76 cm (about 28–30 inches) in length and typically weigh 3–6 kg (about 7–13 pounds). Unlike many other penguin species, male and female chinstrap penguins are roughly the same size and closely resemble one another. Save for patches of dark feathers around the eyes, juveniles are similar to adults in size and coloration. Chicks are clothed in gray feathers and have a black bill.
