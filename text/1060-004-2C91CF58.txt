Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gresset,  (born Aug. 29, 1709, Amiens, Fr.—died  June 16, 1777, Amiens) French poet and dramatist who received immediate and lasting acclaim for his irreverently comic narrative poem Ver-Vert (1734; Ver-Vert, or the Nunnery Parrot), describing with wit tinged with malice the adventures of a parrot who attempts to maintain his decorous convent background while on a visit to another convent.
Brought up by Jesuits, Gresset was a brilliant pupil and, after entering the Jesuit order in 1726, continued his education in Paris before returning to teach in Amiens and Tours. Ver-Vert, which was circulated privately and printed without the author’s permission, brought him instant success in Parisian circles, where the literati were astounded that such a refined wit could come from within the Catholic church.
