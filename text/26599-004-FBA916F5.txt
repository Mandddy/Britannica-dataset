Michael Thomas Sadler,  (born Jan. 3, 1780, Snelston, Derbyshire, Eng.—died  July 29, 1835, Belfast, Ulster, Ire.) radical politician, philanthropic businessman, and leader of the factory reform movement in England, who was a forerunner of the reformers from the working class whose activities (from the late 1830s) became known as Chartism.
An importer of Irish linens in Leeds, Yorkshire, Sadler served as a Tory member of the House of Commons in 1829–30 and again in 1831–32, and then, in December 1832, sought a new parliamentary seat created for Leeds. Although he received considerable working class support, he was defeated by the historian Thomas Babington (later Baron) Macaulay, who had criticized Sadler’s Law of Population (1830), a massive treatise attacking the pessimistic theories of the economist-demographer Thomas Robert Malthus.
