Sir Morell Mackenzie,  (born July 7, 1837, Leytonstone, Essex, Eng.—died  Feb. 3, 1892, London) English physician who was at the centre of a bitter international controversy over the death of Emperor Frederick III of Germany.
Mackenzie, the leading throat specialist of the time, was called into the difficult case of the German crown prince Frederick in May 1887. Frederick’s illness had been diagnosed by German physicians as throat cancer. Basing his opinion on a biopsy made by the eminent German pathologist Rudolf Virchow, Mackenzie insisted that the throat lesion was not demonstrably cancerous and that an operation was unnecessary.
