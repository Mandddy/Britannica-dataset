Gottfried August Bürger,  (born Dec. 31, 1747, Molmerswende bei Halberstadt, Brandenburg, Prussia [Germany]—died  June 8, 1794, Göttingen, Hanover) one of the founders of German Romantic ballad literature whose style reflects the renewed interest in folk song (Volkspoesie) in Europe during the late 1700s.
Bürger was educated in theology at the University of Halle and in law at the University of Göttingen. It was in Göttingen that he first came into contact with a group of Sturm und Drang poets known as the Göttinger Hain, who drew inspiration from folk ballads.
