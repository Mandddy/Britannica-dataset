Sidra, also spelled sidrah or sedra (Hebrew: “order,” “arrangement”), plural sidrot, sidroth, sedrot, or sedroth ,  in Judaism, weekly readings from the Scriptures as part of the sabbath service. Each week a portion, or sidra, of the Pentateuch is read aloud in the synagogue; and it takes a full year to complete the reading.
The Pentateuch—consisting of the biblical books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy and known as the Torah—is the basis of Jewish history and religious beliefs and spells out the laws of the Jewish people. At one time public reading of the Torah was limited to festival days but was extended to all sabbath services in the third century bce in order to make the laws of Jewish life accessible to all.
