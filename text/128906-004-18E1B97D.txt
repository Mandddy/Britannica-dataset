Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), sand-coloured primate native to forests but also found coexisting with humans in northern India, Nepal, eastern and southern China, and northern Southeast Asia. The rhesus monkey is the best-known species of macaque and measures about 47–64 cm (19–25 inches) long, excluding the furry 20–30-cm tail. Females average about 8.5 kg (19 pounds) and males 11 kg. In both sexes the rump and legs are orange.
Rhesus monkeys can thrive in a variety of climates and habitats. Their natural diet consists of fruits, seeds, roots, herbs, and insects, but, in areas of human habitation, they also eat crops and search through garbage for food. Rhesus monkeys live in groups consisting of several adults of both sexes and their young; males leave the troop at maturity, whereas females tend to stay in the troops in which they were born. Because the rhesus monkey is held sacred in some parts of India and is the object of tolerant affection on the part of many Brahmans, it is especially common around temples. Here groups may number 50 to 200 or more, whereas in forests 12 to 20 is usual.
