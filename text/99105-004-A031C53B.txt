Fibula, (
        Latin: “brooch”) outer of two bones of the lower leg or hind limb, presumably so named because the inner bone, the tibia, and the fibula together resemble an ancient brooch, or pin. In humans the head of the fibula is joined to the head of the tibia by ligaments and does not form part of the knee. The base of the fibula forms the outer projection (malleolus) of the ankle and is joined to the tibia and to one of the ankle bones, the talus. The tibia and fibula are further joined throughout their length by an interosseous membrane between the bones. The fibula is slim and roughly four-sided; its shape varies with the strength of the attached muscles. In many mammals, such as the horse and the rabbit, the fibula is fused for part of its length with the tibia.
Fractures of the fibula usually are associated with an ankle injury, though they can occur in isolation (without ankle involvement) or in combination with fractures of the tibia (e.g., in severe injuries). Though less common that tibial stress fractures, fibular stress fractures can occur, most typically in long-distance runners.
