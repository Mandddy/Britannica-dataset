John Cleveland,  (born June 16, 1613, Loughborough, Leicestershire, Eng.—died  April 29, 1658, London) English poet, the most popular of his time, and then and in later times the most commonly abused Metaphysical poet.
Educated at Cambridge, Cleveland became a fellow there before joining the Royalist army at Oxford in 1643. In 1645–46 he was judge advocate with the garrison at Newark until it surrendered to the Parliamentary forces, after which he lived with friends. When Charles I put himself in the hands of the Scots’ army and they turned him over to the Parliamentary forces, Cleveland excoriated his enemies in a famous satire, “The Rebel Scot.” Imprisoned for “delinquency” in 1655, Cleveland was released on appeal to Oliver Cromwell, but he did not repudiate his royalist convictions.
