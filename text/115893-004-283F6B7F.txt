Darling River, river, longest member of the Murray–Darling river system in Australia; it rises in several headstreams in the Great Dividing Range (Eastern Highlands), near the New South Wales–Queensland border, not far from the east coast, and flows generally southwest across New South Wales for 1,702 mi (2,739 km) to join the Murray at Wentworth (on the Victoria border), 150 mi from the Murray’s mouth in South Australia.
The main source of the Darling is usually considered to be the Severn, which becomes successively the Dumaresq, Macintyre, Barwon, and, finally, the Darling. Discharge of the lower tributaries (Culgoa, Warrego, Paroo, Gwydir, Namoi, Macquarie, and Bogan) of the main stream fluctuates as a result of droughts and floods. Because much of the Darling’s course runs through extensive saltbush pastures, receiving an average of less than 10 in. (250 mm) of rain annually, the river often loses more water by evaporation than is gained from its tributaries, many of which sometimes fail to reach the main stream. There are instances in which distributaries leave the main stream and disappear in inland basins. Several, however, flow into salt flats and in wet years emerge to rejoin the parent stream. The Great Anabranch (which leaves below the Menindee Lakes to join the Murray some 300 mi later) and the Talyawalka Anabranch (which leaves the main stem near Wilcannia to rejoin the Darling roughly 80 mi downstream near Menindee) are examples of these anastomosing distributaries (i.e., streams that leave and link up again with the main river). The entire Darling system drains a 250,000-sq-mi (650,000-sq-km) basin with an average annual discharge of 3,600 cu ft (102 cu m) per second at Menindee. The river has an average gradient of 1 in. to the mile.
