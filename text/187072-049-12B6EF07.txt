Surface coating, any mixture of film-forming materials plus pigments, solvents, and other additives, which, when applied to a surface and cured or dried, yields a thin film that is functional and often decorative. Surface coatings include paints, drying oils and varnishes, synthetic clear coatings, and other products whose primary function is to protect the surface of an object from the environment. These products can also enhance the aesthetic appeal of an object by accentuating its surface features or even by concealing them from view.
Most surface coatings employed in industry and by consumers are based on synthetic polymersâ€”that is, industrially produced substances composed of extremely large, often interconnected molecules that form tough, flexible, adhesive films when applied to surfaces. The other component materials of surface coatings are pigments, which provide colour, opacity, gloss, and other properties; solvents or carrier liquids, which provide a liquid medium for applying the film-forming ingredients; and additives, which provide a number of special properties. This article reviews the composition and film-forming properties of polymer-based surface coatings, beginning with the polymer ingredients and continuing through the pigments, liquids, and additives. The emphasis is on paints (by far the most common type of coating), though occasional reference is made to other types of coatings such as drying oils and varnishes. For a fuller understanding of polymeric compounds, which form the basis of surface coatings, the reader is advised to begin with the article industrial polymers, chemistry of.
