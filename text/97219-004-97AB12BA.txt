Princeton University, coeducational, privately endowed institution of higher learning at Princeton, New Jersey, U.S. It was founded as the College of New Jersey in 1746, making it the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States. It was in Princeton’s Nassau Hall in 1783 that General George Washington received the formal thanks of the Continental Congress for his conduct of the American Revolution. Two U.S. presidents—James Madison and Woodrow Wilson—graduated from Princeton, and Wilson served as president of the university from 1902 to 1910. The school’s name was changed to Princeton University in 1896, and its graduate school was opened in 1900. Another famous graduate of Princeton is the novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, who did much to popularize the institution’s image as a bastion of upper-class male privilege. Since 1969 the university has admitted women. Enrollment is approximately 7,000.
In addition to a college and graduate school, Princeton has a School of Engineering and Applied Science (1921) and a School of Architecture (1919). The university’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs continues a long Princeton tradition of furnishing government officials. The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (1951) is one of the foremost research centres on nuclear fusion, while the renowned Institute for Advanced Study (1930), associated with the university but independent of it, is where Albert Einstein spent the last two decades of his life. The Princeton University Art Museum maintains an extensive collection.
