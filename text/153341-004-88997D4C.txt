San Juan, county, northwestern New Mexico, U.S., bordered on the north by Colorado and on the west by Arizona; it also touches Utah at its northwestern tip at the only location in the United States (called the Four Corners) where four states meet. San Juan county is a scenic, semiarid area in the Navajo section of the Colorado Plateau. The centre of the county contains buttes, broken red sandstone mesas, angular volcanic rocks—including the landmark Ship Rock—and mountains rising dramatically from the basically flat landscape, with arroyos and canyons gouged by streams that have mostly dried up. The Chuska Mountains rise to more than 9,000 feet (2,700 metres) in the southwest. The San Juan River, at Lake Navajo, forms the county’s northeastern boundary, then receives the Las Animas River and flows in a long curve through the county. The western half of San Juan county is occupied by the Navajo Indian Reservation and, in a small area near Colorado, the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation. Chaco Culture National Historic Park, Aztec Ruins National Monument, Angel Peak State Recreation Area, and Navajo Lake State Park are all located in the county.
Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) peoples built the pueblo at Aztec Ruins National Monument early in the 12th century; by the 16th century, Pueblo and Navajo Indians were living in the region. War between Navajos and whites was intermittent for over two centuries. The Spanish, then the Americans forced Navajos into slavery, and in 1864 American soldiers led by Colonel Kit Carson forced over 7,000 Navajos to make the “long walk” to the notorious Bosque Redondo, where they lived under great privation. Four years later the vast Navajo reservation was established in New Mexico and Arizona. San Juan county was established in 1887.
