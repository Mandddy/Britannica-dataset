John Greenleaf Whittier,  (born December 17, 1807, near Haverhill, Massachusetts, U.S.â€”died  September 7, 1892, Hampton Falls, Massachusetts) American poet and abolitionist who, in the latter part of his life, shared with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow the distinction of being a household name in both England and the United States.
Born on a farm into a Quaker family, Whittier had only a limited formal education. He became an avid reader of British poetry, however, and was especially influenced by the Scot Robert Burns, whose lyrical treatment of everyday rural life reinforced his own inclination to be a writer.
