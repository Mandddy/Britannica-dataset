Lira, the former monetary unit of Italy and Malta and the currency of modern Turkey.
The lira was introduced in Europe by Charlemagne (c. 742–814), who based it on the pound (Latin: libra) of silver. No lira coins were struck during the Middle Ages, and the lira remained strictly a money of account. By the 16th century several of the Italian states actually struck lira coins, but they varied considerably in weight. One of the states that used the lira was the kingdom of Sardinia, and this monetary unit was adopted in all of Italy when it became unified under Sardinian leadership. In 1862 the Italian lira (plural: lire), which up to then had been divided into 20 solidi, was redefined, and the decimal system was introduced, with 1 lira equal to 100 centesimi. In 2002 the lira ceased to be legal tender in Italy after the euro, the European Union’s monetary unit, became the country’s sole currency.
