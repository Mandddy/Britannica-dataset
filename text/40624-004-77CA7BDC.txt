Sir Francis Walsingham,  (born c. 1532, Kent, England—died April 6, 1590, London) English statesman and diplomat who was the principal secretary (1573–90) to Queen Elizabeth I and became legendary for creating a highly effective intelligence network. He successfully thwarted England’s foreign enemies and exposed domestic plotters who sought to unseat Elizabeth and return a Roman Catholic monarch to the throne. Anticipating methods that would become routine only centuries later in the world’s intelligence services, Walsingham employed double agents, covert propaganda and disinformation, code breaking, and agents provocateurs to advance English interests. His efforts culminated in the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587.
Walsingham came from a family that held a number of minor offices at court. His father, a lawyer, died when Walsingham was about two years old. In 1548 Walsingham enrolled at King’s College, the most ardently Protestant and reformist college of the University of Cambridge, and then in 1552 he was admitted to Gray’s Inn in London to study law.
