Irving Thalberg, in full Irving Grant Thalberg  (born May 30, 1899, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died September 14, 1936, Santa Monica, Calif.) American film executive called the “boy wonder of Hollywood” who, as the production manager of MGM, was largely responsible for that studio’s prestigious reputation.
Born of German immigrant parents, Thalberg suffered from a weak heart and was plagued with health problems all his life. Told by doctors he wouldn’t live past 30, the frail but highly intelligent and ambitious Thalberg lived and worked with an extraordinary intensity. He graduated from high school and worked for two years in the New York offices of Universal Pictures before going to Hollywood as the secretary to the company president, Carl Laemmle. At age 21 Thalberg became Universal’s studio manager.
