Changsha, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’ang-sha,  city and capital of Hunan sheng (province), China. It is on the Xiang River 30 miles (50 km) south of Dongting Lake and has excellent water communications to southern and southwestern Hunan. The area has long been inhabited, and Neolithic sites have been discovered in the district since 1955. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 1,562,204; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 2,604,000.
During the 1st millennium bce the area was the centre of the southern part of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) valley state of Chu. In 1935–36 some Chu graves excavated nearby produced important evidence of Chu culture. The city’s most ancient name was Qingyang. Under the Qin dynasty (221–207 bce) it became a staging post for Qin expeditions into Guangdong province. From Han times (206 bce–220 ce) it was named Linxiang county and was the seat of the Changsha commandery. The county was renamed Changsha in 589, when it became the administrative seat of Tan prefecture. It lost some importance at that time, however, because traffic from Guangdong was mostly diverted up the Gan River valley in Jiangxi. After the fall of the Tang dynasty (618–907), it became the capital of the independent Chu state (927–951) that subsequently fell to other regional powers until being incorporated into the Song dynasty (960–1279). Between 750 and 1100, as Changsha became an important commercial city, the population of the area increased tenfold.
