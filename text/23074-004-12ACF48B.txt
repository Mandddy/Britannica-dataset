Van Morrison, in full Sir George Ivan Morrison  (born August 31, 1945, Belfast, Northern Ireland) Irish singer-songwriter and occasional saxophonist who played in a succession of groups, most notably Them, in the mid-1960s before enjoying a long, varied, and increasingly successful solo career.
Morrison was born into a working-class Protestant family in Belfast. Having been exposed early to blues and jazz through his father’s record collection and having taken up the saxophone, guitar, and harmonica, he began playing in bands while in his mid-teens. When he first appeared before British television audiences in 1965, fronting Them’s thrilling rearrangement of an old blues song (Big Joe Williams’s “Baby Please Don’t Go”), it was clear that Morrison was different. Unlike his rivals, such as Mick Jagger or Eric Burdon, he seemed unwilling to flirt with the audience or even to make eye contact with them. The passion behind his harsh, stuttering delivery was obvious, but it seemed to be directed elsewhere.
