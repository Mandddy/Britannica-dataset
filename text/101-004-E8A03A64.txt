Jōchō,  (died 1057, Japan) great Japanese Buddhist sculptor who developed and perfected so-called kiyosehō, or joined-wood techniques. 
The son (or pupil) of a famous sculptor, Kōshō, Jōchō chiefly worked for Fujiwara Michinaga, de facto ruler of Japan at that time, and his clan. In 1022 he was awarded the Buddhist title of hokkyō, an unprecedented honour for a Buddhist sculptor, for various sculptures he had contributed to the Hōjō Temple in Kyōto. Later he was rewarded by an even more exalted title for sculptures made for the Fujiwaras’ family temple, Kōfuku Temple, in Nara. He was also instrumental in improving the social position of Buddhist sculptors by organizing a guild, which came to be called “Bussho,” or the Buddhist sculpture studio. The Amida (Amitabha) of the Hōō-dō (Phoenix Hall), of the Byōdō Temple at Uji, near Kyōto, is his only extant work. Carved in 1053, it embodies tranquillity and gracefulness, effects achieved by Jōchō’s brilliant use of the joined-wood technique.
