Mondego River, Portuguese Rio Mondego,  largest of the exclusively Portuguese rivers, rising at 4,675 feet (1,425 m) on the northern slopes of the Estrela Mountains (Serra da Estrela) and flowing southwestward for 137 miles (220 km) to the Atlantic Ocean. It has a drainage basin of 2,615 square miles (6,772 square km). A sandbar prohibits navigation above Figueira da Foz, though small craft can sail 52 miles (84 km) upstream to Foz Dão; the river is tidal to Montemor-o-Velho (12 miles [19 km]). The Mondego and its most important tributary, the Alva, have been harnessed for the production of hydroelectric power. Rice is cultivated in the river’s basin. A number of dams of various sizes have been built on the Mondego and its tributaries. Uranium traditionally has been mined at Urgeiriça near the river. Rice, grapes, and many other crops are cultivated in the river’s basin. A broad stream where it flows below Coimbra, the river has inspired passionate poetry.
