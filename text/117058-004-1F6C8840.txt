Bateleur,  (species Terathopius ecaudatus), small eagle of Africa and Arabia, belonging to the subfamily Circaetinae (serpent eagles) of the family Accipitridae. The name bateleur (French: “tumbler”) comes from the birds’ distinctive aerial acrobatics. About 60 cm (2 feet) long, the bateleur has a glossy black head, neck, and underparts; a reddish brown back; whitish to red-brown shoulders; a bare red face; and powerful red-orange feet. Its tail is only 10 cm (4 inches) long (longer in young birds), and its wings, black above and white beneath, are long, pointed, and exceptionally wide. A short full crest makes the bird’s head appear large. One of the most familiar birds of the African skies, it is almost constantly on the wing. Often it turns somersaults in the air, claps its wings loudly, utters cawing or barking cries, and dives with a screaming sound. It hunts open country for small mammals, reptiles, eggs, grasshoppers, and carrion. It seems to favour snakes.
A leaf-lined stick nest is built in a low, spreading tree. The clutch is probably a single egg; the female incubates, for 40 days or more. The young do not fledge until three or four months after hatching. Maturity is reached in the fifth or sixth year.
