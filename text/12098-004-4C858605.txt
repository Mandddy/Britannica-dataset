Paul Éluard, pseudonym of Eugène Grindel   (born Dec. 14, 1895, Saint-Denis, Paris, Fr.—died  Nov. 18, 1952, Charenton-le-Pont) French poet, one of the founders of the Surrealist movement and one of the important lyrical poets of the 20th century.
In 1919 Éluard made the acquaintance of the Surrealist poets André Breton, Philippe Soupault, and Louis Aragon, with whom he remained in close association until 1938. Experiments with new verbal techniques, theories on the relation between dream and reality, and the free expression of thought processes produced Capitale de la douleur (1926; “Capital of Sorrow ”), his first important work, which was followed by La Rose publique (1934; “The Public Rose”) and Les Yeux fertiles (1936; “The Fertile Eyes”). The poems in these volumes are generally considered the best to have come out of the Surrealist movement. At this time Éluard also explored, with André Breton, the paths of mental disorders in L’Immaculée Conception (1930).
