Phenakite, also spelled Phenacite,  rare mineral, beryllium silicate, Be2SiO4, used as a gemstone. Phenakite has long been known from the emerald and chrysoberyl mine on the Takovaya River, near Yekaterinburg (formerly Sverdlovsk), in the Urals region of Russia, where large crystals occur in mica schist. It also occurs in the granite of the Ilmen Mountains in the Urals and of the Pikes Peak region in Colorado. Other notable localities include Kragerø, Norway, and San Miguel de Piricicaba, Brazil. For detailed physical properties, see silicate mineral (table).
For gem purposes the stone is brilliant cut—i.e., with numerous facets. It is often colourless and glassy but may be wine yellow, pale rose, or brown. Its indices of refraction are higher than those of quartz, beryl, or topaz; it is consequently rather brilliant and may sometimes be mistaken for diamond. Nevertheless, it is not in general use, and fine examples are seldom seen outside private or museum collections.
