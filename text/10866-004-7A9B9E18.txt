Hurling, also called hurley,  outdoor stick-and-ball game somewhat akin to field hockey and lacrosse and long recognized as the national pastime of Ireland. There is considerable reference to hurling (iomáin in Gaelic) in the oldest Irish manuscripts describing the game as far back as the 13th century bc; many heroes of ancient tales were expert hurlers. The stick used is called a hurley, camán in Gaelic, and camáns in relief decorate some monuments to 15th-century chieftains. Hurling was for long a game played between neighbouring clans or rival parishes with unlimited numbers of players on either side.
In 1884 the Gaelic Athletic Association was founded in Thurles, County Tipperary, to revive and standardize hurling and other traditional Irish pastimes.
