Friedrich Gentz, also called Friedrich Von Gentz   (born May 2, 1764, Breslau, Silesia, Prussia [now Wrocław, Pol.]—died  June 9, 1832, Vienna, Austria) German political journalist, famous for his writings against the principles of the French Revolution and Napoleon and as a confidential adviser of Metternich. Though a commoner, he sometimes affected the von of nobility, having received a Swedish knighthood in 1804.
Gentz’s father was a Prussian civil servant; his mother came from the French Huguenot colony of Berlin, with which young Gentz liked to associate. Up to an advanced age, he wrote his diaries in French, displaying in that language the same limpid elegance that distinguished his German. He studied under the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) but was essentially self-taught, acquiring historical, juridical, and economic knowledge from books, chiefly English works. In 1785 Gentz entered the Prussian civil service in Berlin and in 1793 became a secretary in the War Office.
