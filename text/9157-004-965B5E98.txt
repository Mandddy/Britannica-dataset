Swiftlet,  (genus Collocalia), any of numerous species of cave-dwelling birds belonging to the swift family, Apodidae, found from southeastern Asia (India and Sri Lanka) and the Malay Peninsula through the Philippines, and eastward to the islands of the South Pacific.
The taxonomy of the 15 to 20 nearly identical species is controversial. Dull brown or gray above (sometimes glossed with blue or green) and paler on the rump and underparts, swiftlets are 9 to 15 cm (3.5 to 6 inches) long. They fly lower, more erratically, and more slowly than most swifts.
