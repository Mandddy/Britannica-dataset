Kelsey Grammer,  (born February 21, 1955, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands) American actor, perhaps best known for his portrayal of the pompous, acerbic, but somehow lovable psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane on the television series Cheers and its spin-off Frasier.
Grammer grew up in New Jersey and Florida and began acting in high school. Encouraged by his teachers to consider acting as a career, he enrolled in the Juilliard School in New York City. After two years there, Grammer joined the Old Globe Theatre company in San Diego, California, where he acted in plays by William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw. He also performed in regional theatres throughout the United States and in Off-Broadway productions of Plenty, Sunday in the Park with George, A Month in the Country, and Quartermaineâ€™s Terms. On Broadway he appeared in Macbeth (1981) and Othello (1982).
