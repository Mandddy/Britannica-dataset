Père David’s deer (Elaphurus davidianus), large, rare Asian deer in the family Cervidae (order Artiodactyla). The only member of its genus, it is unknown in nature within historical times. Presumably native to northern China, it is now found only in zoos, private animal collections, and game reserves.
The deer is about 1.1 metres (43 inches) tall at the shoulder and is characterized by heavy legs, broad hooves, relatively small ears, and a long, bushy tail. The coat is reddish brown in summer and uniformly grayish brown in winter. The male has long antlers that fork shortly above the base, the front prong branching once and the rear prong extending backward, unbranched.
