Virgil, also spelled Vergil, Latin in full Publius Vergilius Maro  (born October 15, 70 bce, Andes, near Mantua [Italy]—died September 21, 19 bce, Brundisium) Roman poet, best known for his national epic, the Aeneid (from c. 30 bce; unfinished at his death).
Virgil was regarded by the Romans as their greatest poet, an estimation that subsequent generations have upheld. His fame rests chiefly upon the Aeneid, which tells the story of Rome’s legendary founder and proclaims the Roman mission to civilize the world under divine guidance. His reputation as a poet endures not only for the music and diction of his verse and for his skill in constructing an intricate work on the grand scale but also because he embodied in his poetry aspects of experience and behaviour of permanent significance.
