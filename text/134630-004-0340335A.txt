Henriette Sontag, original name Gertrud Walpurgis Sonntag   (born Jan. 3, 1806, Koblenz, Fr. [now in Germany]—died  June 17, 1854, Mexico City, Mex.) German operatic and concert soprano who enjoyed great acclaim both before and after a 19-year hiatus in her career.
The child of actor Franz Sonntag and singer Franziska Martloff Sonntag, she received early theatrical training and played juvenile roles in both stage plays and operas in Germany and in Prague, where her mother moved after her father’s death. For several years she studied at the Conservatory there, making her adult operatic debut in 1821 as the princess in François-Adrien Boieldieu’s Jean de Paris. After hearing her perform in Gioacchino Rossini’s La donna del lago in Vienna in 1823, Carl Maria von Weber asked her to create the title role in his Euryanthe. The premiere performance later that year was a triumph for both singer and composer. In 1824 she sang the premieres of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony and Missa Solemnis in Vienna and for the next few years toured Berlin, Paris, London, and most of the other major European centres.
