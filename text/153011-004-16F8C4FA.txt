Tim Burton, byname of Timothy William Burton  (born August 25, 1958, Burbank, California, U.S.) American director known for his original, quirky style that frequently drew on elements of the fantastic and the macabre.
Burton, who became interested in drawing and filmmaking while quite young, attended the California Institute of the Arts and later worked as an animator at Disney Productions. After making a series of short films, including the horror-movie homage Frankenweenie (1984), Burton directed his first feature film, Pee-Weeâ€™s Big Adventure, in 1985. A box-office success, the family movie centred on a man-child (played by Paul Reubens) looking for his stolen bicycle. With the dark comedy Beetlejuice (1988), Burton established himself as an unconventional filmmaker. He turned to more mainstream fare with the big-budget Batman (1989) and its sequel Batman Returns (1992). Both films were major hits. Burton was also responsible for the concept and general design of the stop-motion animation film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), which was directed by Henry Selick.
