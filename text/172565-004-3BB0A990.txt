Paul of Aegina, Latin Paulus Aegineta   (born c. 625, Aegina, Greece—died c. 690) Alexandrian physician and surgeon, the last major ancient Greek medical encyclopaedist, who wrote the Epitomēs iatrikēs biblio hepta, better known by its Latin title, Epitomae medicae libri septem (“Medical Compendium in Seven Books”), containing nearly everything known about the medical arts in the West in his time.
Based largely on the works of such earlier Greek physicians as Galen, Oribasius, and Aëtius, the Epitome greatly influenced the medical practice of the Arabs, who considered Paul among the most authoritative of Greek medical writers. The Persian master physician al-Rāzī (Rhazes) drew extensively from the work in writing his Kitāb al-Manṣūrī (“Book to al-Manṣūr”) and Abū al-Qāsim, one of Islam’s foremost surgeons, borrowed heavily from the Epitome’s sixth, or surgical, book in compiling the 30th chapter (“On Surgery”) of his Al-Taṣrīf (“The Method”). Thus, Paul’s work exercised a lasting influence on Western medieval medicine when the Arabic works were adopted as primary references in medieval Europe.
