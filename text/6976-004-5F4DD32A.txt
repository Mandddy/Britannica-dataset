Olaf Bull, in full Olaf Jacob Martin Luther Bull  (born November 10, 1883, Kristiania [now Oslo], Norway—died June 23, 1933, Oslo) one of the greatest Norwegian poets of his generation and often referred to as the Keats of Norway.
As a young man, he studied philology, then wrote for newspapers, while already writing poetry. His first volume, Digte (1909; “Poems”), immediately led to recognition. He was influenced by the French Symbolists and by the philosophy of Henri Bergson. Besides poetry, he wrote one detective story and collaborated on a play. Throughout his work, the reader is conscious of his forceful intellect, but not until his later poems, De hundrede år (1928; “The Hundred Years”) and Ignis ardens (1932), does he become less esoteric and more involved with society. This promising new development was cut short by illness and early death.
