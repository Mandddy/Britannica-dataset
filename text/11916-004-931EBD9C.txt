Sir Charles Fellows,  (born August 1799, near Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, Eng.—died Nov. 8, 1860, London) English archaeologist who discovered ruins of the cities of Lycia—in antiquity a region of present-day southwestern Turkey—and transported a large number of marble sculptures to England.
In 1832 he began travelling through Italy, Greece, and the Middle East, sketching as he went. Many of his drawings were used to illustrate Lord Byron’s Childe Harold. In 1838 he reached the region of Lycia and explored the Xanthus (modern Koca) River nine miles upstream to the ruins of the ancient Lycian capital, Xanthus (modern Kınık, Tur.). He published his findings in A Journal Written During an Excursion in Asia Minor (1839). Returning to the region shortly afterward, he identified 13 ancient cities and in 1841 published An Account of Discoveries in Lycia, Being a Journal Kept During a Second Excursion in Asia Minor. In 1842 he gained permission to ship 78 cases of Lycian sculpture and architectural fragments to England. In 1844, for the British Museum, he acquired 27 cases of statuary, the best known being 6th- and 5th-century-bc Greek tomb sculptures from Xanthus. This act earned him a knighthood in 1845.
