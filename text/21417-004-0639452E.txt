Albertville 1992 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in Albertville, France, that took place February 8â€“23, 1992. The Albertville Games were the 16th occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
The 1992 Games are noted for not only a change in the modern Olympics but a change in the world as well. It was the last time that the Summer and Winter Games would be held in the same year; the next winter competition was scheduled for 1994, while the summer events were slated for 1996. The Games also reflected the changing political climate in central and eastern Europe. Competing as the Unified Team (UT), athletes from the former Soviet republics participated as a single team for the last time. The German squad was reunited following the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989), and Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia competed as independent countries for the first time in over 50 years.
