Hugh Montague Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard,  (born Feb. 3, 1873, Taunton, Somerset, Eng.—died  Feb. 10, 1956, London) British officer and air marshal who helped lay the foundations of the Royal Air Force (RAF).
Trenchard entered the army in 1893 and served in the South African War and later in Nigeria. After being invalided home in 1912, he learned to fly and in 1913 became assistant commandant of the Central Flying School, Upavon, Wiltshire. In 1915, during World War I, he assumed command in France of the Royal Flying Corps, which was then a branch of the British army. His policy of launching persistent attacks in order to establish dominance of the air became the standard doctrine of Britain’s air force. In January 1918 he became Britain’s first chief of air staff, though he resigned the post in April of that year. Subsequently that year, he organized the Inter-Allied Independent Bomber Force, a force of RAF heavy bombers to raid targets in Germany.
