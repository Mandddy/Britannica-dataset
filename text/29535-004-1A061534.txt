Chard (Beta vulgaris, variety cicla), also called Swiss chard,  variety of the beet of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), grown for its edible leaves and leafstalks. Fresh chard is highly perishable and difficult to ship to distant markets. The young leaves can be eaten raw in salads, while larger leaves and stalks are commonly sautéed or served in soups. Chard is a good source of vitamin A and vitamin C and is popular as a home-garden vegetable because of its ease of culture, productiveness, and tolerance to moderately hot weather.
Chard is a biennial plant but is typically cultivated as an annual. Unlike other beet varieties, the plant does not have fleshy roots. Its large leaves can grow to more than 30 cm (1 foot) in length and can be harvested continually throughout the growing season, though production slows in the heat of summer. Some cultivars, often marketed as “rainbow chard,” have colourful stalks, which can be red, orange, yellow, or pale green. The plant is killed by deep freezes but can persist in mild climates. Chard generally flowers its second year, during which the leaves are bitter and unpalatable.
