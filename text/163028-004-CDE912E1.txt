Adam brothers,  (born 18th century) three French brothers who sculpted many monuments for the French and Prussian royal residences. They were exponents of a style that employed the textures of shells, corals, and perforated rocks. Lambert-Sigisbert Adam (1700–59) created sculptures for King Louis XV of France and Frederick the Great of Prussia. Nicolas-Sébastien Adam (1705–78) sculptured for Stanislas I Leszczyński, father-in-law of Louis and former king of Poland. François-Gaspard-Balthasar Adam (1710–61) was responsible for works at Frederick’s royal palace of Sanssouci near Potsdam and at Potsdam itself.
