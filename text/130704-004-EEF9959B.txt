Bomb, a container carrying an explosive charge that is fused to detonate under certain conditions (as upon impact) and that is either dropped (as from an airplane) or set into position at a given point. In military science, the term “aerial bomb” or “bomb” denotes a container dropped from an aircraft and designed to cause destruction by the detonation of a high-explosive bursting charge or incendiary or other material. Bombs differ from artillery shells, missiles, and torpedoes in that the latter are all propelled through the air or water by a man-made agency, while bombs travel to their targets through the force of gravity alone. A major distinction must also be made between conventional bombs and atomic and thermonuclear bombs, which have a far greater destructive capacity. (See atomic bomb; thermonuclear bomb.)
The typical conventional bomb is a streamlined cylinder that consists of five major parts: an outer casing, the inner explosive material, devices such as fins to stabilize the bomb in flight, one or more fuzes to ignite the bomb’s main charge, and a mechanism for arming the fuze or preparing it to explode. The outer case is most commonly made of metal and has a point at its tip, or nose. The explosive charge in most conventional bombs usually consists of TNT, RDX, ammonium nitrate, or other high explosives in combination with each other. The fin assembly at the tail end of the bomb enables it to fall through the air nose-first, by the same principle as the feathers on an arrow.
