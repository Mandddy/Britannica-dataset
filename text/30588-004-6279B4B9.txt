Johann Jakob Bodmer,  (born July 19, 1698, Greifensee, Switz.—died  Jan. 2, 1783, near Zürich) Swiss historian, professor, and critical writer who contributed to the development of an original German literature in Switzerland.
Bodmer taught Helvetian history at the Zürich grammar school from 1725 until 1775 and from 1737 was a member of the Grosser Rat (cantonal legislature). In conjunction with others, he published (1721–23) Die Discourse der Mahlern, a weekly journal after the model of The Spectator. His most important writings are the treatises Von dem Einfluss und Gebrauche der Einbildungs-Kraft (1727), Von dem Wunderbaren in der Poesie (1740), and Critische Betrachtungen über die poetischen Gemälde der Dichter (1741), in which he pleaded for freeing the literary imagination from the restrictions imposed upon it by French Neoclassicism. Bodmer also engaged in studies of William Shakespeare, Torquato Tasso, Dante, and Miguel de Cervantes; translated Homer (in hexameters); espoused the causes of Montesquieu and Jean-Jacques Rousseau; and thus played a part in European literature as a precursor of Johann Gottfried von Herder. In his own country he was an influential national educator. As a poet he was unsuccessful.
