Iceland moss (Cetraria islandica), fruticose (branched, bushy) lichen with an upright thallus usually attached in one place. It varies in colour from deep brown to grayish white and may grow to a height of 7 cm (3 inches). The trough-shaped branches fork into flattened lobes that are edged with short hairs. Iceland moss grows in alpine areas of the Northern Hemisphere and on the lava slopes and plains of Iceland, whence it received its name. It is an important food for reindeer, caribou, musk-oxen, and moose. Iceland moss is also used as a food supplement for sheep and cattle and was probably the first lichen used as food by humans. It is soaked, dried, powdered, and mixed with cereals and potatoes for use in breads, soups, salads, and jellies. Slightly bitter-tasting, it contains about 70 percent lichenin, a lichen starch, and an extractable brown dye. Because Iceland moss is a source of glycerol, it is used in the soap industry and in the manufacture of cold creams.
