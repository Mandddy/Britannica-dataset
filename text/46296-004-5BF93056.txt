Visigothic art, works of art produced in southern France and Spain under the Visigoths, who ruled the region between the 5th and the 8th centuries ad. The art produced during this period is largely the result of local Roman traditions combined with Byzantine influences. The effect of Germanic metalworking techniques is also seen in the decorative arts, but the ornamentation of these pieces, most notably a collection of jeweled crowns and crosses known as the treasure of Guarrazar, owes nothing to the Germanic artistic traditions. Instead, plant and animal motifs from the Mediterranean and Eastern traditions are used.
The architecture of the Visigoths was small in scale, but its masonry work was excellent, stone vaulting was often employed, and horseshoe arches were characteristic. Buildings of the 7th century, such as San Juan Bautista, Ba√±os de Cerrato (661), were most often basilican in plan and short and wide in elevation. Ornamental sculpture was a distinctive feature of these churches.
