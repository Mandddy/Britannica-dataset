Okuni,  also called Izumo no Okuni   (flourished  17th century) Japanese dancer who is credited as being the founder of the Kabuki art form. Although many extant contemporary sources such as paintings, drawings, and diaries have shed light on Okuni’s life, the accuracy of such primary sources has been difficult to establish. Very little is known about her life for certain.
Okuni is said to have been an attendant at the Grand Shrine of Izumo, the oldest Shintō shrine in Japan. It is possible that she was a temple dancer or even a prostitute. She formed a troupe of female dancers who in 1603 gave a highly popular performance of dances and light sketches on a makeshift stage set up in the dry bed of the Kamo River in Kyōto. The performance was a strong departure from the older, traditional Noh drama style, in which the actors engaged in slow, deliberate movements. It was so popular that she arranged a variety of other similar events. According to some accounts, Okuni dressed as a young man while she performed certain dances. The company’s lusty and unrestrained dance dramas soon became known throughout Japan—the style acquiring the name Okuni Kabuki—and other troupes of female dancers were formed.
