Wrought iron,  one of the two forms in which iron is obtained by smelting; the other is cast iron. Wrought iron is a soft, ductile, fibrous variety that is produced from a semifused mass of relatively pure iron globules partially surrounded by slag. It usually contains less than 0.1 percent carbon and 1 or 2 percent slag. It is superior for most purposes to cast iron, which is overly hard and brittle owing to its high carbon content. Dating back to antiquity, the first iron was smelted directly from iron ore by heating the latter in a forge with charcoal, which served both as a fuel and a reducing agent. While still hot, the reduced iron and slag mixture was then removed as a lump and worked (wrought) with a hammer to expel most of the slag and weld the iron into a coherent mass.
In Europe it was found that wrought iron could be produced indirectly from cast iron made in a blast furnace. One of the most widely used such indirect methods, called the puddling process, was developed by Henry Cort of England in 1784. It involved melting cast iron in a hollowed hearth and then agitating it with a bar so that the carbon in the cast metal was removed by the oxidizing gases of the furnace. As the carbon was removed, the proportion of solid decarbonized iron progressively increased, and the resulting thick mixture of metal and slag was then run through a squeezer, which removed much of the excess slag and formed a rough cylinder for subsequent rolling into a more finished product.
