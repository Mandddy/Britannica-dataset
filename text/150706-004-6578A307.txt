Norwegian Sea, Norwegian Norskehavet,  section of the North Atlantic Ocean, bordered by the Greenland and Barents seas (northwest through northeast); Norway (east); the North Sea, the Shetland and Faroe islands, and the Atlantic Ocean (south); and Iceland and Jan Mayen Island (west). The sea reaches a maximum depth of about 13,020 feet (3,970 m), and it maintains a salinity of about 35 parts per 1,000. A submarine ridge linking Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and north Scotland separates the Norwegian Sea from the open Atlantic. Cut by the Arctic Circle, the sea is often associated with the Arctic Ocean to the north. The warm Norway Current flows northeastward off the Norway coast and produces generally ice-free conditions. Colder currents mixing with this warm water create excellent fishing grounds (mainly for cod, herring, and whitefish), especially around coastal regions of Iceland and Norway and the Shetland and Faroe islands.
