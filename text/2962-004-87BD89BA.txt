Emission nebula, in astronomy, a bright, diffuse light sometimes associated with stars whose temperatures exceed 20,000 K. The excitation process necessary to provide observed optical and radio energies in such gaseous regions was long an astronomical puzzle. It was found that ultraviolet light from the star ionizes nearby hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms emit visible light after the electrons and nuclei recombine and the atoms drop to lower energy levels.
