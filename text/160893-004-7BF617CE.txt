Leonard Baskin,  (born August 15, 1922, New Brunswick, New Jersey, U.S.—died June 3, 2000, Northampton, Massachusetts) American sculptor, illustrator, and printmaker noted for his impressive though bleak portrayals of the human figure.
Baskin, who decided at age 14 to become a sculptor, studied at New York University’s School of Architecture and Allied Arts and at Yale University, where he also developed an interest in printing. In 1942 he founded Gehenna Press, which published finely illustrated books—most notably, editions by poets Ted Hughes and Anthony Hecht that featured Baskin’s art. During World War II Baskin served in the U.S. Navy, and, after a stint with the merchant marine, he returned to New York, where he attended the New School for Social Research (B.A., 1949; now The New School). Baskin also studied in Paris and Florence and was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1953. He later taught at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts (1953–74), and at Hampshire College in Amherst (1984–94).
