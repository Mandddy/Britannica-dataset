King snake (genus Lampropeltis), any of seven species of moderate- to large-sized terrestrial snakes found from southeastern Canada to Ecuador. Adults generally range in length from 1 to 1.5 metres (3.3 to 5 feet), but some have grown to 2.1 metres. They are nonvenomous constrictors and have a cosmopolitan diet that includes small mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, amphibians, and bird eggs. As a sign of nervousness, king snakes will twitch their tails.
The common king snake (Lampropeltis getula, with seven subspecies) is found throughout the United States and northern Mexico. It is variable in pattern and may be black or dark brown, with yellow or white stripes, rings, crossbars, or spots. The California king snake (Lampropeltis getula californiae) exhibits two pattern types, the common ringed pattern and a rarer striped form; both patterns can appear from a single clutch of eggs. King snakes derive their common name from the common king snake’s habit of feeding upon other snakes, including rattlesnakes and copperheads, to whose venom they are immune. Occasionally king snakes are cannibalistic, even within their own species. In captivity they can survive for 30 years or more. Eggs are laid in clutches of 5–24.
