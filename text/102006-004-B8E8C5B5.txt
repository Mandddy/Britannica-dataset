Guillotine,  instrument for inflicting capital punishment by decapitation, introduced into France in 1792 during the Revolution. It consists of two upright posts surmounted by a crossbeam and grooved so as to guide an oblique-edged knife, the back of which is heavily weighted to make it fall forcefully upon (and slice through) the neck of a prone victim.
Previous to the French Revolution, similar devices were in use in Scotland, England, and various other European countriesâ€”often for the execution of criminals of noble birth.
