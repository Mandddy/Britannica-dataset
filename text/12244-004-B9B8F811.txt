Michael Drayton,  (born 1563, Hartshill, Warwickshire, Eng.—died  1631, London) English poet, the first to write odes in English in the manner of Horace.
Drayton spent his early years in the service of Sir Henry Goodere, to whom he owed his education, and whose daughter, Anne, he celebrated as Idea in his poems. His first published work, The Harmonie of the Church (1591), contains biblical paraphrases in an antiquated style. His next works conformed more nearly to contemporary fashion: in pastoral, with Idea, The Shepheards Garland (1593); in sonnet, with Ideas Mirrour (1594); in erotic idyll, with Endimion and Phoebe (1595); and in historical heroic poem, with Robert, Duke of Normandy (1596) and Mortimeriados (1596). The last, originally written in rhyme royal, was recast in Ludovico Ariosto’s ottava rima verse as The Barrons Warres (1603).
