Cannaceae, the canna family of the ginger order (Zingiberales), a single genus with about 19 species, distributed from southeastern North America through South America. These tropical herbs possess rhizomes (underground stems) with erect stems growing to 3 m (10 feet) high. The tall or dwarf foliage displays spirally arranged leaves that may be green or bronze. The flowers are asymmetrical, with one half-functional stamen and a labellum, a petal-like structure rolled outward. The two to three “petals” are actually sterile stamens (staminodes); there are also three regular petals. Sometimes spotted variations of the scarlet, red-orange, or yellow flowers occur.
The genus Canna is widely grown for ornamental use. One species, C. edulis, from Peru has edible, starchy rhizomes.
