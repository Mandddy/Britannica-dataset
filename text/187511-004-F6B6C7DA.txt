Whitney Museum of American Art, collection in New York City of predominantly 20th- and 21st-century American art, including painting, sculpture, photography, film, video, installation, and works on paper. It was founded in 1930 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, a sculptor and promoter of American art. The museum opened in Greenwich Village in 1931 and relocated on several occasions, notably in 1966 when the collection was installed in a Madison Avenue building designed by Marcel Breuer. In 1932 the museum established its biennial, an invitational exhibition that continues in the 21st century and features current trends and significant developments in American art. In 2014 the museum closed in order to move to its present location in the city’s meatpacking district on Gansevoort Street and alongside the city’s High Line elevated park. The eight-story building, which was designed by Renzo Piano and is notable for its use of natural light, opened to the public in May 2015. In March 2016 the Metropolitan Museum of Art took over the Whitney’s Madison Avenue building (the “Met Breuer”) to use as another exhibition space.
The museum’s holdings consist of more than 22,000 works and contain the world’s largest collection of paintings by Edward Hopper. The museum also has notable collections of works by Alexander Calder, Louise Nevelson, Georgia O’Keeffe, Jasper Johns, Cindy Sherman, Agnes Martin, and Brice Marden.
