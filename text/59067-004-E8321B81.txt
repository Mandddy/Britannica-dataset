Paleolithic Period, also spelled Palaeolithic Period, also called Old Stone Age,  ancient cultural stage, or level, of human development, characterized by the use of rudimentary chipped stone tools. (See also Stone Age.)
The onset of the Paleolithic Period has traditionally coincided with the first evidence of tool construction and use by Homo some 2.5 million years ago, near the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). In 2015, however, researchers excavating a dry riverbed near Kenya’s Lake Turkana discovered primitive stone tools embedded in rocks dating to 3.3 million years ago—the middle of the Pliocene Epoch (some 5.3 million to about 2.6 million years ago). Those tools predate the oldest confirmed specimens of Homo by almost 1 million years, which raises the possibility that toolmaking originated with Australopithecus or its contemporaries and that the timing of the onset of this cultural stage should be reevaluated.
