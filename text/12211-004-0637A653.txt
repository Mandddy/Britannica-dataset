André Duchesne, Latin Andreas Chesneus, Andreas Quercetanus, orAndreas Querneus   (born May 1584, Île-Bouchard, Fr.—died  May 30, 1640, Paris) historian and geographer, sometimes called the father of French history, who was the first to make critical collections of sources for national histories.
Duchesne was educated at Loudun and Paris and devoted his early years to studies in history and geography. His first work, Egregiarum seu Selectarum Lectionum et Antiquitatum Liber (1602; “Andreas Querneus’ Book of Extraordinary or Select Readings and Antiquities”), drew attention to his great erudition. Later, through the influence of the Cardinal de Richelieu, he was appointed historiographer and geographer to the king.
