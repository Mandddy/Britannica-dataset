Rings, also called still rings ,  gymnastics apparatus consisting of two small circles that are suspended by straps from an overhead support and grasped by the gymnast while performing various exercises. They were invented in the early 19th century by the German Friedrich Jahn, known as the father of gymnastics. Competition on the rings requires the most strength of any gymnastics event, although since the 1960s the trend in this exclusively male competition has been toward a style of performance that emphasizes swinging, somewhat diminishing the demand of strength. The rings have been part of the gymnastics program in the Olympic Games since its modern revival in 1896.
Made of wood or metal, the rings are 28 mm (1.1 inches) thick and have an inside diameter of 18 cm (7.1 inches). They are suspended by straps mounted 5.75 metres (18.8 feet) above the floor, the rings themselves hanging 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) above the floor and 50 cm (19.7 inches) apart.
