Apapane,  (Himatione sanguinea), Hawaiian songbird, common on larger islands, a nectar-feeding member of the Hawaiian honeycreeper family, Drepanididae (order Passeriformes). About 13 centimetres (5 inches) long, it is red, except for its dark wings and tail and its white vent. Its bill is fairly short and slightly curved. The apapane lives chiefly in upland forests and is especially fond of ohia flowers.
