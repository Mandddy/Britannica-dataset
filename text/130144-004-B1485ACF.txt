Bamileke,  any of about 90 West African peoples in the Bamileke region of Cameroon. They speak a language of the Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo family. They do not refer to themselves as Bamileke but instead use the names of the individual kingdoms to which they belong or else refer to themselves as “grasslanders.” Their origin is uncertain, but it appears that under pressure from Fulani invasions in the 17th century they moved southward in a series of migrations from the region that is now occupied by the Tikar people.
Each of their kingdoms was ruled by a king (fon) whose position was hereditary within a localized patrilineal lineage. Some of these kings were assisted by a queen mother (mafo). Descent, succession, and inheritance are patrilineal among the Bamileke. Polygyny is practiced, marriage often involving a substantial bride-price. The Bamileke practice sedentary farming. Their staple crops include corn (maize), taro, and groundnuts (peanuts). Men clear the fields, build houses, and engage in crafts, while women do most of the cultivating. They have little livestock.
