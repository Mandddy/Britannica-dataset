David Halberstam,  (born April 10, 1934, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died April 23, 2007, Menlo Park, Calif.) American journalist and author who received a Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his penetrating coverage of the Vietnam War as a staff reporter (1960–67) for The New York Times. He went on to become the best-selling author of more than 20 meticulously researched books.
After earning a bachelor’s degree in journalism from Harvard University (1955), Halberstam worked as a reporter for the Daily Times Leader in West Point, Miss., and for the Nashville Tennessean (now the Tennessean) before joining The New York Times. While his reporting on Vietnam initially supported U.S. involvement there, The Making of a Quagmire (1965) reflected a growing disillusionment with the war, and its title became a byword for intractable military operations. Halberstam’s examination of power resulted in three volumes that were viewed loosely as a trilogy: The Best and the Brightest (1972) chronicled the military failings of the United States during the Vietnam War; The Powers That Be (1979) reviewed the impact that the media had on history; and The Reckoning (1986) scrutinized the auto industry. War in a Time of Peace: Bush, Clinton, and the Generals (2001) was a contender for a Pulitzer Prize, and Halberstam won praise for New York September 11: By Magnum Photographers (2001) and Firehouse (2002), both of which were written in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001.
