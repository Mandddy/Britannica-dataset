Chartered by the Republic of Texas in 1845, Baylor was founded by the Texas Baptist Education Society and named for Judge R.E.B. Baylor, one of its founders. Instruction in law began in 1849, and the law school was organized in 1857. Originally located in the town of Independence, the university was moved in 1886 to Waco, where it merged with Waco University. The business school was organized in 1923. Baylor University College of Medicine (established in Waco in 1900, affiliated with Baylor in 1903, and moved to Houston in 1943) included such distinguished heart surgeons as Denton A. Cooley and Michael DeBakey and endocrinologist Andrew V. Schally, a Nobel laureate, on its staff; in 1969 it became an independent institution, renamed the Baylor College of Medicine. At one time the university was also affiliated with the Baylor College of Dentistry, located in Dallas (1918–71). Track-and-field athlete Michael Johnson is a Baylor alumnus.
