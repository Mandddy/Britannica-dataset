Yo-Yo Ma,  (born October 7, 1955, Paris, France) French-born American cellist known for his extraordinary technique and rich tone. His frequent collaborations with musicians and artists from other genres, cultures, and media reinvigorated classical music and expanded its audience.
Born to Chinese parents, Ma was a child prodigy and at age five gave his first public recital. He later moved to New York City with his family and made his Carnegie Hall debut at age nine. He studied at the Juilliard School under Leonard Rose and JÃ¡nos Scholz before graduating from Harvard University (1977) with a degree in humanities. He was the recipient of the Avery Fisher Prize in 1978, and in 1991 Harvard awarded him an honorary doctorate in music.
