Olof von Dalin,  (born Aug. 29, 1708, Vinberg, Swed.—died  Aug. 12, 1763, Stockholm) writer and historian who wrote the first easily readable and popular Swedish works and who helped bring the ideas of the Enlightenment into Swedish culture.
Dalin, a poor clergyman’s son, was educated at the University of Lund, and upon arriving in Stockholm he became a favourite with aristocratic families as a tutor and salon habitué. Dalin became the centre of Swedish literary attention when he was discovered to be the previously anonymous author of the first literary periodical to appear in Sweden, the extremely popular Then swänska Argus (1732–34), modeled on Joseph Addison’s Tatler and Spectator. This periodical helped introduce the ideas of the Enlightenment into Sweden, but its language and literary style were of even greater importance; it is regarded as ushering in the age of modern Swedish prose. Neither of Dalin’s two dramatic works nor his rather ambitious epic poem, Swenska friheten (1742; “Swedish Liberty”), proved very successful. His best and most popular work is the allegory Sagan om hästen (1740; “The Tale About the Horse”), in which a horse represents the Swedish people and its masters represent the various Swedish kings. Of his folk ballads, which indirectly conveyed his political views, the best known is Hattvisan (“The Hat Ballad”). Dalin’s great interest was history; he wrote three volumes of a lively Svea rikes historia (1747–62; “History of the Swedish Kingdom”). He was a central figure of Queen Louisa Ulrica’s literary salon and tutor to the Crown Prince, later Gustav III.
