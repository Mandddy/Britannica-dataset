Chiropractic,  a system of healing based on the theory that disease in the human body results from a lack of normal nerve function. Chiropractors employ treatment by manipulation and specific adjustment of body structures, such as the spinal column, and use physical therapy when necessary. Chiropractors thus are concerned with the relationship between the musculoskeletal structures and functions of the body and the nervous system in the restoration and maintenance of health. The chiropractic method was founded in 1895 by an Iowa merchant, D.D. Palmer, who reportedly cured deafness in one individual by realigning a misaligned vertebrae. Doctors of chiropractic are trained in and through accredited chiropractic colleges. Procedures include the adjustment and manipulation of the articulations and adjacent tissues of the human body, particularly of the spinal column, and sometimes related therapies such as heat therapy, traction, and nutrition counseling.
