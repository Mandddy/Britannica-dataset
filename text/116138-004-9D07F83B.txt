James Purdy,  (born July 17, 1923, Ohio, U.S.—died March 13, 2009, Englewood, N.J.) American novelist and short-story writer whose works explored the American way of life and presented a vision of human alienation, indifference, and cruelty.
Purdy, who grew up in small Ohio towns, was educated at the Universities of Chicago and Puebla (Mexico). He served as an interpreter and taught for a few years before turning to writing full-time. His first two works—Don’t Call Me by My Right Name and Other Stories and 63: Dream Palace, a novella (both 1956)—were rejected by a number of American publishing houses and were first published by Purdy through a subsidy publisher. These books won the support of Dame Edith Sitwell and, following their publication in England, met with critical acclaim in America as well.
