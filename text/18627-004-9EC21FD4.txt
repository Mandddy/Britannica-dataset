Berks, county, southeastern Pennsylvania, U.S., bounded to the north by Blue Mountain. It consists mostly of mountainous terrain in the Appalachian Ridge and Valley physiographic provinceâ€”except for the southern corner, which consists of rolling piedmont. The principal streams are the Schuylkill and Conestoga rivers and Maiden, Hay, Northkill, Tulpehocken, Allegheny, Monocacy, and Manatawny creeks. Recreation areas include Ontelaunee and Blue Marsh lakes, as well as Nolde Forest and French Creek state parks. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail follows Blue Mountain along the northwestern edge of the county.
Reading, the county seat, was laid out in 1748 on land owned by the sons of William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania. Once inhabited by Delaware Indians, the region became populated with the German settlers who were misleadingly called the Pennsylvania Dutch (see Pennsylvania German). The county was created in 1751 and named for Berkshire, England. Industrial growth followed the opening of the Schuylkill Canal (1824), the Union Canal (1828), the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (1838), and the Schuylkill Valley Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad (1884). Near Womelsdorf was the homestead of Johann Conrad Weiser, a colonial agent to the Iroquois Indians. Near Birdsboro is the birthplace of frontiersman Daniel Boone (1734) and the Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site, a restored iron-making community from the early 19th century.
