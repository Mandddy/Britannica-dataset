Stockholm 1912 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Stockholm that took place May 5–July 27, 1912. The Stockholm Games were the fifth occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
Known as the “Swedish Masterpiece,” the 1912 Olympics were the best organized and most efficiently run Games to that date. Electronic timing devices and a public address system were used for the first time. The Games were attended by approximately 2,400 athletes representing 28 countries. New competition included the modern pentathlon and swimming and diving events for women. The boxing competition was canceled by the Swedish organizers, who found the sport disagreeable; this cancellation, along with controversial officiating at earlier Olympics, prompted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to greatly curtail the role of local organizing groups after 1912.
