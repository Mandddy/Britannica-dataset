Johnny Depp, in full John Christopher Depp II  (born June 9, 1963, Owensboro, Kentucky, U.S.) American actor and musician. He was known for his eclectic and unconventional film choices and achieved perhaps his greatest success as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.
At age 16 Depp dropped out of high school to pursue a music career. His band, the Kids, relocated from Florida, where he spent the majority of his childhood, to Los Angeles. In 1983 Depp married Lori Anne Allison, who worked as a makeup artist while he struggled as a musician. Allison had her friend the actor Nicolas Cage arrange for Depp to audition with director Wes Craven, and Depp made his film debut as a teenager eaten by his own bed in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). He divorced Allison the following year.
