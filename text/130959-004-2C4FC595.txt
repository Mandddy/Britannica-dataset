Nancy Pelosi, née Nancy Patricia D’Alesandro   (born March 26, 1940, Baltimore, Md., U.S.) American politician who was the first woman to serve as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives (2007–11). She then became the House minority leader (2011– ).
D’Alesandro—whose father, Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., was a politician and New Deal Democrat—studied political science at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1962. The following year she married Paul Pelosi, and the couple moved to New York. Five children and six years later, the family settled in San Francisco, where Pelosi worked as a volunteer Democratic organizer. Earning a reputation as a highly effective fund-raiser, she rose through the ranks, serving on the Democratic National Committee and as chair of both the California Democratic Party (1981–83) and the host committee for the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Along the way, Pelosi befriended longtime U.S. Rep. Phil Burton. Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala, who, shortly before her death in 1987, urged Pelosi to run for the seat. She narrowly won a special election and was reelected in 1988 to a full term. Pelosi easily won subsequent elections in her overwhelmingly Democratic district.
