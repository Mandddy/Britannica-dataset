Sofer, also spelled Sopher (Hebrew: “scribe”), plural Soferim, or Sopherim,  any of a group of Jewish scholars who interpreted and taught biblical law and ethics from about the 5th century bc to about 200 bc. Understood in this sense, the first of the soferim was the biblical prophet Ezra, even though the word previously designated an important administrator connected with the Temple but without religious status. Ezra and his disciples initiated a tradition of rabbinic scholarship that remains to this day a fundamental feature of Judaism.
With the decline of the soferim, their tradition of biblical scholarship was largely taken over by the Pharisees and, in later generations, by the tannaim, amoraim, and geonim. Despite the similarity of their functions, each of the groups had its own technical name.
