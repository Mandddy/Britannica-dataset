Clostridium, genus of rod-shaped, usually gram-positive bacteria, members of which are found in soil, water, and the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals. Most species grow only in the complete absence of oxygen. Dormant cells are highly resistant to heat, desiccation, and toxic chemicals and detergents. The species are variable in size. A typical species, C. butyricum, ranges from 0.6 micrometre across by 3 to 7 micrometres long. The toxins produced by C. botulinum, the causative agent of botulism, are the most potent poisons known. The toxin of C. tetani causes tetanus when introduced into damaged or dead tissue. C. perfringens, C. novyi, and C. septicum can cause gangrene in humans. Other forms of acute clostridial infection commonly occur in livestock and waterfowl.
