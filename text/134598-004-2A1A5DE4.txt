Karol Szymanowski, in full Karol Maciej Szymanowski   (born Oct. 6, 1882, Timoshovka, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died  March 29, 1937, Lausanne, Switz.) the foremost Polish composer of the early 20th century.
Szymanowski began to compose and play the piano at an early age. In 1901 he went to Warsaw and studied harmony, counterpoint, and composition privately until 1904. Finding the musical life in Warsaw limiting, he went to Berlin, where he organized the Young Polish Composers’ Publishing Co. (1905–12) to publish new works by his countrymen. His compositions from this period, which include the opera Hagith (1913), show the influence of Strauss, Wagner, and Scriabin.
