Ultraviolet telescope, telescope used to examine the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between the portion seen as visible light and the portion occupied by X-rays. Ultraviolet radiation has wavelengths of about 400 nanometres (nm) on the visible-light side and about 10 nm on the X-ray side. Earth’s stratospheric ozone layer blocks all wavelengths shorter than 300 nm from reaching ground-based telescopes. As this ozone layer lies at an altitude of 20–40 km (12–25 miles), astronomers have to resort to rockets and satellites to make observations from above it.
From 1978 to 1996 an orbiting observatory known as the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) studied celestial sources of ultraviolet radiation. The IUE telescope was equipped with a 45-cm (18-inch) mirror, and it recorded data electronically down to 100 nm. The IUE observed from a geosynchronous orbit (i.e., its period of revolution around Earth was identical to the period of Earth’s rotation) in view of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Data was transmitted to the ground station at the end of each observing tour and examined immediately on a television monitor.
