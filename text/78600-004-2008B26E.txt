Muggins, also called all fives,  domino game similar to the regular drawing game except for the rule that if a player can play a piece that makes the sum of the open-end pips on the layout a multiple of five, he scores that number. Each player takes five pieces. If the leader poses (places) either 5-5 (double-five), 6-4, 5-0, or 3-2, he scores the number of pips that are on the piece. If the leader does not score and to 2-4 the next player plays 4-3, the second player scores 5 (2 + 3); if to 2-4 he can play 4-4, he scores 10 because a doublet scores its whole value. He must play if he can match; if he cannot, he draws until he can. Scores made during play (muggins scores) are called and taken immediately. By prior agreement, if a player overlooks a score, his opponent may call “muggins” (meaning “simpleton”) and take the score for himself. The first player to play all his pieces scores in points the multiple of five that is nearest to the number of pips on pieces remaining in his adversary’s hand. If neither hand can match, the lowest number of pips wins and the score is taken as before. Winner is the first to reach a total of 200 points.
Sniff, a very popular domino game in the United States, is essentially muggins, but the first double played is called sniff and may be put down endwise or sidewise (à cheval), at the holder’s option. Thereafter, one may play to this piece both endwise and sidewise.
