Dandie Dinmont terrier, breed of terrier developed in the border country of England and Scotland. First noted as a distinct breed about 1700, it was later named after a character created by Sir Walter Scott in his novel Guy Mannering (1815). Unlike other terriers, the Dandie Dinmont has a softly curved, rather than angular, body. It has large eyes, a long body, short legs, and a large, domed head crowned by a silky topknot. Its crisp-textured coat, a combination of hard and soft hairs, may be pepper (silver-gray to blue-black) or mustard (light fawn to reddish brown) in colour. The Dandie Dinmont stands 8 to 11 inches (20 to 28 cm) and weighs 18 to 24 pounds (8 to 11 kg).
