Land snail, any of the approximately 35,000 species of snails (phylum Mollusca) adapted to life away from water. Most species are members of the subclass Pulmonata (class Gastropoda); a few are members of the subclass Prosobranchia. Typically, land snails live on or near the ground, feed on decaying plant matter, and lay their eggs in the soil. They are most common on tropical islands but occur also in cold regions, where they hibernate. Arboreal forms, such as Liguus of Florida and Cuba, tend to be brightly coloured; terrestrial forms usually are drab. Largest in size are those of the genus Achatina, of Africa, some 20 cm (8 inches) across. Several common land snails (Helix species) of Europe are table delicacies, especially in France.
