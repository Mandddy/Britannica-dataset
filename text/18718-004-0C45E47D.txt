Rockingham, county, extreme southeastern New Hampshire, U.S. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and Maine and Little and Great bays to the northeast; the Piscataqua River constitutes the boundary with Maine. The county is the state’s only coastal lowland, although the terrain rises to more than 1,000 feet (305 metres) at Mount Pawtuckaway in the northwest. The principal waterways are the Exeter, Squamscott, and Lamprey rivers and Massabesic, Pawtuckaway, and Northwood lakes. New Hampshire and Maine share the Isles of Shoals, offshore islands notable for trade and fishing in the early 18th century. Recreational areas along the coastline include Hampton Beach, Rye Harbor, Wallis Sands, and Ordiorne Point state parks. Other public lands include Pawtuckaway, Kingston, and Bear Brook state parks. The county is forested with white pine.
North Salem contains an archaeological site that dates to about 1000 bce. Abenaki, Squamscott, and Pennacook Indians clashed with settlers of the region from the 1690s through the 1720s. Portsmouth, the site of New Hampshire’s oldest settlement (1623), was an important colonial seaport noted for fur trading and shipbuilding. It contains several historic buildings, including the Richard Jackson House (built c. 1664), the oldest residence in New Hampshire.
