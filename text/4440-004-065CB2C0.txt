Steer wrestling, also called bulldogging,  rodeo event in which a mounted cowboy (or bulldogger) races alongside and then tackles a full-grown steer. The event starts with the bulldogger and his hazer (a second rider who keeps the steer running straight) on either side of the steer’s chute. The steer has a head start, which is maintained by a rope around the steer that is tied to a barrier in front of the two riders’ horses; there is a 10-second penalty for a broken barrier. The cowboy races beside the steer, reaches down to grasp its horns, and slides off his horse. With legs forward the cowboy digs in his heels, stopping the steer, and twists it to the ground. Time is called when the steer is flat on its side with all four legs and head in the same direction. The contestant with the fastest time wins.
