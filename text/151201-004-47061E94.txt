The Tale of Peter Rabbit, one of the best-selling children’s books of all time, written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, printed privately in 1901 and published in 1902. Potter created the character of Peter Rabbit in 1893 in a letter she wrote to amuse a sick child. She used the name of her own pet rabbit, Peter, whom she had trained to do tricks. She devised adventures for Peter and gave him a mother and three siblings, Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, in The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor’s Garden, with 42 black-and-white illustrations and a coloured frontispiece. This classic book was widely translated, went through countless editions, and had more than 20 sequels featuring animal protagonists. The simple text was greatly enhanced by Potter’s delicate drawings of animals that were recognizably realistic woodland creatures despite their humanlike clothing and homes.
