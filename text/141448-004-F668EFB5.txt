Yonne River, Latin Icauna,  river, north central France, a left-bank tributary of the Seine River. From its source in the Nièvre département at the foot of Mont Preneley, located in the Morvan heights west of Autun, to its confluence with the Seine at Montereau, the Yonne is 182 mi (293 km) long. It speeds north-northwest through deep, wooded gorges to Pannessières–Chaumard, where its turbulent waters are dammed to regulate its flow as well as that of the Seine. Passing through Clamecy, accompanied by the Canal du Nivernais, it enters the Yonne département and receives the Cure above Auxerre. The canalized Armançon joins it above Joigny, through which it flows before passing Sens and veering northwest to Montereau. It is navigable for 70 mi downstream from Auxerre.
