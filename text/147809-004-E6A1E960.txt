James Franco, in full James Edward Franco  (born April 19, 1978, Palo Alto, California, U.S.) American actor whose rakish charm and chiseled good looks augmented an ability to bring sincerity and gravitas to characters ranging from addled drug dealers to comic book villains.
The eldest of three children, Franco was raised in Palo Alto, California, by his mother, a children’s book author, and his father, a businessman. A strong student, Franco nonetheless dropped out of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), after his first year in order to pursue acting. While taking classes at Playhouse West in Los Angeles, he secured a series of roles in unremarkable television movies and forgettable teen fare. His casting as a cocky high-school slacker in the Judd Apatow-produced television series Freaks and Geeks (1999–2000)—later a cult favourite—brought him to wider attention.
