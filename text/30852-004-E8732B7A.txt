Water strider, also called pond skater or skimmer,  any insect of the family Gerridae (order Heteroptera), which numbers about 350 species. Water striders, often seen running or skating in groups over the surface of a pond or stream, are slender, dark coloured, and generally more than 5 mm (0.2 inch) long.
With their short front legs they capture insects that fall onto the water’s surface. In crowded conditions water striders have been known to prey on each other. The middle and hind pairs of legs are long, sometimes more than twice the length of the body. The middle pair is used for propulsion, and the hind pair is used for steering. The feet (tarsi) are covered with fine water-resistant hairs that enable the insect to remain on the water’s surface. Often two forms of the adult occur in the same species: one wingless, the other winged. Occasionally a third form with short wings appears.
