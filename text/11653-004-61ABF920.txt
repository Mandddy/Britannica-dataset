Funnel weaver, also called grass spider,  any of certain members of the spider family Agelenidae (order Araneida). Agelenids are notable for their funnel-shaped webs; they are a common group with many species that are distributed worldwide. The webs are built in the grass, under boards and rocks, and among debris. Agelena naevia, a common North American species, varies greatly in size and colour. The body of the male may be up to 8 millimetres (about 1/3 inch) long; the female grows to about 19 millimetres (about 3/4 inch). Two wide, dark stripes often extend the length of the anterior part of the body. The body colour ranges from pale yellow to dark reddish brown. The spider lives for one year.
