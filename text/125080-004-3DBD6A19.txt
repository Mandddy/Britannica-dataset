Hebron, Arabic Al-Khalīl, in full Al-Khalīl al-Raḥmān (“The Beloved of [God] the Merciful” [a reference to Abraham]), Hebrew Ḥevron,  city in the West Bank, situated in the southern Judaean Hills south-southwest of Jerusalem. Located about 3,050 feet (930 metres) above sea level, Hebron long benefited from its mountainous clime, which encouraged the cultivation of fruit trees and vineyards. In addition, its location at a natural crossroads placed it along a historically desirable travel route. In modern times, Hebron was administered as part of the British mandate of Palestine (1920–48); after the first of the Arab-Israeli wars in 1948–49, it was in the territory annexed by Jordan (1950). Following the Six-Day War of June 1967, it was part of the West Bank territory that came under Israeli occupation. In the wake of an agreement reached in January 1997, part of Hebron came under the administration of the Palestinian Authority (PA), while part of the city remained under Israeli control.
Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the region. Because of its associations with the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and with King David, it is one of the four holy cities of Judaism (Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias, and Ẕefat [Safed]). In Islamic tradition, which reveres Abraham as a founder of monotheism and precursor of Muhammad, Hebron is among the four holiest cities (Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, and Hebron). In addition to its important associations with Abraham, Hebron has been regarded by some Muslims as the site of a stopping point along Muhammad’s miʿrāj, or miraculous night journey to Jerusalem; as a result, Hebron has long been a significant site of pilgrimage.
