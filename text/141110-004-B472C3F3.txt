Severn River,  river, northwestern Ontario, Canada. It rises in the Finger Lake region of western Ontario and flows northeast for about 610 miles (980 km) through Severn Lake to Hudson Bay. Discovered in 1631, it was originally named New Severn (after the Severn in England) by Captain Thomas James. Although blocked by rapids, it was often used by traders as a portage route between Lake Winnipeg and Hudson Bay. Fort Severn, a Hudson’s Bay Company post established at the river’s mouth in 1685, was burned in 1689 to avoid capture by the French, who rebuilt it as Fort-Thérèse. Abandoned in 1714, it was reestablished in 1759 by the British and still functions as a trading post.
