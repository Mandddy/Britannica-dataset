Montgomery Clift, in full Edward Montgomery Clift  (born October 17, 1920, Omaha, Neb., U.S.—died July 23, 1966, New York, N.Y.) American motion-picture actor noted for the emotional depth and sense of vulnerability he brought to his roles. Along with Marlon Brando and James Dean, he helped delineate a new paradigm for American cinematic heroes.
Clift’s childhood was unconventional. His family moved frequently, and Clift spent a significant amount of time in Europe. When he was 12 he auditioned for a theatre company in Sarasota, Florida, and won a role in As Husbands Go. From 1934 to 1945 he performed regularly on and off Broadway, appearing in such notable plays as Robert Sherwood’s There Shall Be No Night (1940), Thornton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth (1942), and Lillian Hellman’s The Searching Wind (1944). He worked with, among others, actor Alfred Lunt and director Robert Lewis (both of whom served as mentors) and became known for the intelligence and dedication he brought to his work.
