Coppermine River, stream, in southern Kitikmeot region, Nunavut territory, and northern Fort Smith region, Northwest Territories, Canada. From its source in a small lake of the Barren Grounds (a subarctic prairie region), north of Great Slave Lake, it flows northward for 525 miles (845 km), draining several lakes, including de Gras, Point, Itchen, Takiyuak, and Dismal, before emptying into Coronation Gulf, an arm of the Arctic Ocean, near Bloody Falls Territorial Historic Park and the Inuit settlement of Kugluktuk (formerly Coppermine). The river was discovered in 1771 by the English explorer Samuel Hearne, who named it for the copper that was reportedly found along its banks. Unnavigable because of numerous rapids and a short ice-free season, it is a noted Arctic char fishing stream.
