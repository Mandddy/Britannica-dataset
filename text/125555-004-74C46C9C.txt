Thamūd,  in ancient Arabia, tribe or group of tribes that seem to have been prominent from about the 4th century bc to the first half of the 7th century ad. Although the Thamūd probably originated in southern Arabia, a large group apparently moved northward at an early date, traditionally settling on the slopes of Mount Athlab. Recent archaeological work has revealed numerous Thamūdic rock writings and pictures not only on Mount Athlab but also throughout central Arabia.
The Qurʾān mentions the Thamūd as examples of the transitoriness of worldly power. Traditionally, the Thamūd were warned by the prophet Ṣāliḥ to worship Allāh, but the Thamūd stubbornly refused and as a result were annihilated either by a thunderbolt or by an earthquake. Actually, they may have been destroyed by one of the many volcanic outbreaks that have formed the far-reaching Arabian lava fields.
