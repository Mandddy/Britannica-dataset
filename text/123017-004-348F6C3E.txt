Ningbo, Wade-Giles romanization Ning-po,  city, northeastern Zhejiang sheng (province), China. Ningbo (“Calm Waves”) is situated in the low-lying coastal plain on the Yong River, some 16 miles (25 km) upstream from its mouth in Hangzhou Bay, at the confluence where two tributaries, the Yuyao and Fenghua rivers, join the main stream. Ningbo was from an early period itself a port, although the mouth of the river was masked by a mud bar. It has an outport, Zhenhai, on the western bank of the estuary, which originally had been a fishing port. Pop. (2000) city, 1,696,811; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 1,923,000.
After Gouzhang county, a short distance to the east, was transferred to what is now Ningbo in 625, it became the seat of an independent Ming prefecture in 738. In 908 the county seat’s name, which had been Mao Xian since 625, was changed to Yin Xian, which it has since retained. Under the Nan (Southern) Song (1127–1279), Ming prefecture was promoted in 1195 to a superior prefecture, Qingyuan. It kept this name through the Yuan (Mongol) period (1206–1368). In 1381 it became Ningbo superior prefecture, and it kept that name until 1912, when it was demoted to county status, taking the formal name of Yin Xian. It regained the name of Ningbo when the county seat was separated from the county to form a new city in 1949.
