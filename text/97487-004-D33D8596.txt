Xiuhtecuhtli, (
        Nahuatl: “Turquoise [Year] Lord”) also called Huehueteotl or Old God,  Aztec god of fire, thought to be the creator of all life. “Old God” is a reflection of his relative age in the Aztec pantheon. In association with Chantico, his feminine counterpart, Xiuhtecuhtli was believed to be a representation of the divine creator, Ometecuhtli.
One of the important duties of an Aztec priest centred on the maintenance of the sacred fire, making sure that it would burn perpetually. A new fire was ritually kindled during the dedication of new buildings. The two festivals of Xiuhtecuhtli coincide with the two extremes in the climatological cycle, the heat of August and the cold of January. Once every 52 years, at the end of a complete cycle in the calendar of the Aztecs, fire was ceremonially transferred first from temple to temple and then from temples to homes.
