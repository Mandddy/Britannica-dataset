Padmasambhava, also called Guru Rimpoche, Tibetan Slob-dpon (“Teacher”), or Padma ’Byung-gnas (“Lotus Born”)  (flourished 8th century) legendary Indian Buddhist mystic who introduced Tantric Buddhism to Tibet and who is credited with establishing the first Buddhist monastery there.
According to tradition, he was a native of Udyāna (now Swat, Pak.), an area famed for its magicians. Padmasambhava was a Tantrist and a member of the Yogācāra sect and taught at Nalanda, a centre of Buddhist studies in India. He was invited to Tibet in 747 by King Thī-srong-detsan and arrived at Samye (Bsan-yas), where he is said to have exorcised demons that were inhibiting the construction of a Buddhist monastery by causing earthquakes. He supervised the completion of the monastery in 749.
