Samuel Clarke,  (born Oct. 11, 1675, Norwich, Norfolk, Eng.—died  May 17, 1729, Leicestershire) theologian, philosopher, and exponent of Newtonian physics, remembered for his influence on 18th-century English theology and philosophy.
In 1698 Clarke became a chaplain to the bishop of Norwich and in 1706 to Queen Anne. In 1704–05 he gave two sets of lectures, published as A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God (1705) and A Discourse Concerning the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion (1706). In the first set he attempted to prove the existence of God by a method “as near to Mathematical, as the nature of such a Discourse would allow.” In the second he argued that the principles of morality are as certain as the propositions of mathematics and thus can be known by reason unassisted by faith, an approach sometimes called ethical rationalism. The criticism of religion by David Hume resulted in part from his dissatisfaction with Clarke’s effort to prove the existence of God. Clarke also spurred a vehement and prolonged controversy with his Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity (1712), which led many of his opponents to accuse him of Arianism, the belief that Christ is neither fully man nor fully God.
