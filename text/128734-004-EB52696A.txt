Motorola, Inc., American manufacturer of wireless communications and electronic systems. In 2011 it split into two companies: Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions. Its headquarters are located in Schaumburg, Ill.
The company was founded in 1928 in Chicago by brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin as the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation. Its first product was the “battery eliminator,” a device that connected direct-current, battery-powered radios to the alternating current then found in almost two-thirds of U.S. households. In 1930 the company began selling a low-cost automobile radio, called the Motorola, that became the most popular new-car option, as well as a successful aftermarket kit. In 1937 the company diversified into home tabletop radios and introduced the first car radio to offer push-button dialing.
