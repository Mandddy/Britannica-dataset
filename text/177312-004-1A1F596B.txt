Ernst Lubitsch,  (born January 28, 1892, Berlin, Germany—died November 30, 1947, Hollywood, California, U.S.) German-born American motion-picture director who was best known for sophisticated comedies of manners and romantic comedies. Lubitsch was an anomaly as an active director who also served as the head of production at a major studio, as he did briefly at Paramount. While the lion’s share of his career occurred during the silent era—when he made more than 40 German silents before moving to United States—the influence of his sound pictures far exceeds their number.
Lubitsch was born into a Jewish family. He worked in his father’s Berlin clothing store while acting at night. In 1911, at age 19, he joined the company of stage director Max Reinhardt. Lubitsch played minor stage roles until shortly before World War I, when he began performing in one-reel silent film comedies in the ethnically stereotyped but sympathetic role of Meyer, a well-meaning Jewish bungler. In the process he became one of the most popular comic actors in Germany and began writing and directing the Meyer films.
