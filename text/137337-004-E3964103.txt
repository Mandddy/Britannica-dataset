Antpipit, either of two species of South American birds of the genus Corythopis that resemble pipits in size, shape, and coloration. The name antpipit is sometimes improperly applied to the gnateaters (Conopophaga), who were formerly classified with antpipits in the family Conopophagidae; Corythopis is now usually classified with the tyrant flycatchers in the family Tyrannidae (order Passeriformes).
