Ludwig Quidde,  (born March 23, 1858, Bremen, Ger.—died  March 5, 1941, Geneva, Switz.) historian, politician, and one of the most prominent German pacifists of the early 20th century. He was the cowinner (with Ferdinand-Édouard Buisson) of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1927.
During 1889–96 he was editor of the Deutsche Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft and in 1890 became professor and secretary of the Prussian Historical Institute in Rome. In 1892 he returned to Munich and joined the German Peace Society. In 1894 he published a pamphlet, Caligula, which had the appearance of a historical study but was actually a caustic satire on the German emperor William II; the enormously popular publication brought Quidde three months’ imprisonment for lese majesty. From 1907 to 1919 Quidde was a liberal member of the Bavarian Landtag (Assembly) and member of the Interparliamentary Union. From 1914 to 1929 he served as chairman of the German Peace Society. During World War I he opposed German sentiments for the annexation of foreign territories as a condition for a peace settlement.
