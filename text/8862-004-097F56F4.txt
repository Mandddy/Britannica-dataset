Vasily (IV) Shuysky,  (born 1552—died  Sept. 12, 1612, Gostynin, near Warsaw) boyar who became tsar (1606–10) during Russia’s Time of Troubles.
A member of an aristocratic family descended from Rurik, the legendary founder of the dynasty that ruled Russia until 1598, Vasily Shuysky achieved prominence in 1591 when he conducted the investigation of the death of Dmitry Ivanovich, the brother and heir of Tsar Fyodor I (ruled Russia 1584–98) and determined that the nine-year-old child had killed himself with a knife while suffering an epileptic fit. In 1605, however, after Boris Godunov, Fyodor’s chief adviser and his brother-in-law, had become tsar and a pretender claiming to be Prince Dmitry had appeared, Shuysky reversed himself and, declaring that Dmitry had escaped death in 1591, supported the pretender’s claim to the throne. When Boris died in April 1605, Shuysky instigated a movement to murder Boris’ son Fyodor II and swore allegiance to the first False Dmitry.
