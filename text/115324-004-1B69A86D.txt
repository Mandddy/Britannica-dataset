James Clarence Mangan,  (born May 1, 1803, Dublin—died  June 20, 1849, Dublin) a prolific and uneven writer of almost every kind of verse whose best work, inspired by love of Ireland, ranks high in Irish poetry.
The son of an unsuccessful grocer, at the age of 15 Mangan became a copying clerk in a scrivener’s office and remained one for 10 years. He then lived as best he could, contributing to the prestigious Dublin University Magazine and to the major nationalist newspaper, The Nation, though posts were found for him for brief periods in the library of Trinity College, Dublin, and the Ordnance Survey Office. His natural melancholy was aggravated by years of ill-paid drudgery and an acute disappointment in love. He became an opium addict and a chronic drunkard, and the last years of his life were spent in extreme neglect and wretchedness. When he died of cholera, only two persons attended his funeral.
