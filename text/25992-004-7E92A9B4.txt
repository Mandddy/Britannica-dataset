Hermann Samuel Reimarus,  (born Dec. 22, 1694, Hamburg—died March 1, 1768) German philosopher and man of letters of the Enlightenment who is remembered for his Deism, the doctrine that human reason can arrive at a religion (so-called natural religion) more certain than religions based on revelation.
Appointed professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages at the Hamburg Gymnasium, or preparatory school, in 1727, Reimarus made his house a cultural centre and meeting place for learned and artistic societies. His first important philosophical work was Abhandlungen von den vornehmsten Wahrheiten der natürlichen Religion (1754; “Treatises on the Principal Truths of Natural Religion”), a Deistic discussion of cosmological, biological–psychological, and theological problems. In Die Vernunftlehre (1756; “Doctrine of Reason”) he combated traditional Christian belief in revelation.
