Tokutomi Roka, pseudonym of Tokutomi Kenjirō   (born Dec. 8, 1868, Minamata, Japan—died  Sept. 18, 1927, Ikaho) Japanese novelist, the younger brother of the historian Tokutomi Sohō.
Tokutomi worked for years as a writer for his brother’s publications, but he began going his own way in 1900 on the strength of the success of his novel Hototogisu (1898; “The Cuckoo”; Eng. trans. Namiko), a melodramatic tale of tragic parental interference in a young marriage. Shizen to jinsei (1900; “Nature and Man”), a series of nature sketches, and the semiautobiographical Omoide no ki (1901; Footprints in the Snow) confirmed his decision to pursue his own literary career. Through the years, Tokutomi turned toward an eccentric mysticism, which his wife came to share. As the result of a meeting with the novelist Leo Tolstoy, he retired to the country to live a Tolstoyan “peasant life,” recorded in Mimizu no tawagoto (1913; “Gibberish of an Earthworm”). He died in the midst of writing four volumes of confessions, a monumental work later completed by his wife.
