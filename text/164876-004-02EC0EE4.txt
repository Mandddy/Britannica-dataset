Claude Pepper, in full Claude Denson Pepper   (born September 8, 1900, Dudleyville, Alabama, U.S.—died May 30, 1989, Washington, D.C.) American politician, known as a champion of the elderly, who served for more than 60 years in public office.
After graduating from the University of Alabama (A.B., 1921) and Harvard University Law School (J.D., 1924), Pepper taught and practiced law before his election to the Florida legislature (1929), where he sponsored a bill allowing senior citizens to fish without a license. As a Democratic U.S. senator (1937–51), he endorsed the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, rejected American isolationism in World War II, and supported legislation that created Social Security, minimum wages, and medical assistance for elderly people and handicapped children. Detractors called him “Red Pepper” not for his red hair but for his liberal views, which included economic support to the Soviet Union, an unpopular sentiment in 1951, when he lost his Senate seat.
