Yohkoh, Japanese satellite that provided continuous monitoring of the Sun from 1991 to 2001.
Originally designated Solar-A, Yohkoh (“Sunlight”) was launched on Aug. 30, 1991, from the Kagoshima Space Center by Japan’s Institute of Space and Astronautical Sciences. It had an international payload of two whole-disk cameras (one for soft X-rays in the range of 0.25–3 kiloelectron volts [or thousand electron volts; keV] and the other for hard X-rays in the range of 10–100 keV) and two spectrometers to study flares and other energetic events during the period of maximum sunspot activity. It lasted far beyond its three-year baseline mission and continued to make observations through the solar minimum and the following renewal of activity, becoming the first spacecraft to observe the Sun continuously in X-rays over an entire 11-year solar cycle. Yohkoh’s long-term monitoring of how the Sun ejects material provided a basis for predicting “space weather” in the vicinity of Earth.
