Sandy Koufax, byname of Sanford Koufax, original name Sanford Braun  (born Dec. 30, 1935, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.) American professional baseball player who, despite his early retirement due to arthritis, was ranked among the sport’s greatest pitchers. A left-hander, he pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the National League (NL) from 1955 to 1957, continuing, after they became the Los Angeles Dodgers, from 1958 to 1966.
Born Sanford Braun, he was given his stepfather’s surname when his mother remarried. The young Koufax first excelled in basketball, which earned him a scholarship to the University of Cincinnati. There he earned a spot on the school’s varsity baseball team, and his pitching prowess led to tryouts with a number of professional teams. Koufax was signed by the Dodgers, and he left school after one year to immediately join the team’s major league roster.
