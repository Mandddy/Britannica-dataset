Léon Daudet, in full Alphonse-marie-léon Daudet  (born Nov. 16, 1867, Paris, France—died July 1, 1942, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence) French journalist and novelist, the most virulent and bitterly satirical polemicist of his generation in France, whose literary reputation rests largely upon his journalistic work and his vivid memoirs.
The son of the novelist Alphonse Daudet, Léon studied medicine before turning to journalism with contributions to Le Figaro and Le Gaulois. His first novel, L’Astre noir (1893; “The Black Heavenly Body”), was followed by a scathing indictment of the medical profession, Les Morticoles (1894). His novel Le Voyage de Shakespeare (1896) was more successful than many that followed it.
