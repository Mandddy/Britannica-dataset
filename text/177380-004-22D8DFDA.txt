Otto Preminger, in full Otto Ludwig Preminger  (born December 5, 1905, Wiznitz, Bukovina, Austria-Hungary [now Vyzhnytsya, Ukraine]—died April 23, 1986, New York, New York, U.S.) Austrian-born American director who defied Hollywood’s Production Code with a series of controversial films—notably The Moon Is Blue (1953), The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and Anatomy of a Murder (1959)—which helped bring about the relaxation of censorship regulations. Preminger neither condemned nor condoned his protagonists’ behaviour, and his movies became known for their moral neutrality. Particularly adept at thrillers, he also helmed such classics as Laura (1944).
Preminger, who was the son of the attorney general of the Austrian Empire, earned a law degree from the University of Vienna in 1928. However, by that time, he was already active in the theatre, and he subsequently studied acting with the legendary Max Reinhardt. He then opened his own stock companies, Die Komodie Theatre and Die Schauspielhaus. In 1931 Preminger directed the German-language film, Die grosse Liebe (The Great Love), and in 1933 the aging Reinhardt named him producer-director of Vienna’s renowned Theatre in der Josefstadt.
