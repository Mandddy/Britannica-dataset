Juggler, (
        Latin joculare, "to jest"
            ) entertainer who specializes in balancing and in feats of dexterity in tossing and catching items such as balls, plates, and knives. Its French linguistic equivalent, jongleur, signifies much more than just juggling, though some of the jongleurs may have turned to juggling when their original role fell out of fashion.
Juggling was a highly developed art long before the medieval period, according to evidence found in ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman sculpture, coins, and manuscripts. Comparison with these ancient records reveals that although juggling has advanced in technical perfection, the underlying principles are still the same. In an early manuscript, for example, a bear is shown standing on its hind legs and juggling with three knives. (A similar feat is performed in the modern Russian circus with the bear lying in a small cradle and juggling a flaming torch with its hind legs).
