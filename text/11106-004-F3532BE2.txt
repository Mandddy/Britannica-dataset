Henrietta Maria, French Henriette-Marie   (born Nov. 25, 1609, Paris—died Sept. 10, 1669, Château de Colombes, near Paris) French wife of King Charles I of England and mother of Kings Charles II and James II. By openly practicing Roman Catholicism at court, she alienated many of Charles’s subjects, but during the first part of the English Civil Wars she displayed courage and determination in mustering support for the king’s cause.
Henrietta Maria was the daughter of King Henry IV of France and Marie de Médicis. Throughout her childhood she was surrounded by political intrigue; her father was assassinated six months after her birth, and when she was seven her mother was banished from Paris. In 1625, at the age of 15, she was married to Charles. At first the insolence with which she was treated by Charles’s favourite, George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, severely strained her relationship with the king, but after the assassination of Buckingham (August 1628) Charles fell in love with his wife. She was a patron of drama and generally presided over a lively court.
