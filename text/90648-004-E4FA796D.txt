The Manchurian Candidate, American Cold War thriller, released in 1962, that catapulted John Frankenheimer to the top ranks of Hollywood directors.
A platoon of American soldiers led by Maj. Bennett Marco (played by Frank Sinatra) is captured, taken to Manchuria, and brainwashed by communists during the Korean War. Ignorant of their brainwashing, the soldiers are released, and after the war Marco, Sgt. Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), and another member of the unit mysteriously experience the same recurring nightmare in which Shaw follows communist orders and kills two other members of the unit. Shaw’s controller in the West is his mother (Angela Lansbury), who orders him to kill Thomas Jordan, a U.S. senator who stands in the way of Shaw’s stepfather, Sen. John Iselin (a secret communist, like his wife, posing as a reactionary), from running for the vice presidency of the United States. Shaw had recently eloped with Jordan’s daughter, and he ends up murdering both of them. The action reaches a climax as Marco races against time to the convention centre to stop Shaw from carrying out an assassination of the presidential nominee, which would place Iselin (“the Manchurian Candidate”) in line to become president.
