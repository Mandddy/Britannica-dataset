Oliver Twist, British dramatic film, released in 1948, that was an adaptation of Charles Dickensâ€™s classic tale of the same name. It features a memorable performance by Alec Guinness in one of his first film roles.
The story follows the adventures of Oliver Twist (played by John Howard Davies), an orphan in 19th-century England, who encounters a number of setbacks in his quest to find security and happiness. He lives in a harshly run orphanage until being sold as an apprentice to a cruel undertaker. Oliver soon runs away and falls in with a gang of young pickpockets that is headed by slippery thief Fagin (played by Guinness), with the help of the brutal Bill Sikes (Robert Newton). Oliver is eventually able to escape from this life but not without difficulties.
