Shelf fungus, also called bracket fungus,  basidiomycete that forms shelflike sporophores (spore-producing organs). Shelf fungi are commonly found growing on trees or fallen logs in damp woodlands. They can severely damage cut lumber and stands of timber. Specimens 40 cm (16 inches) or more in diameter are not uncommon. A specimen of Fomitiporia ellipsoidea discovered in 2010 on Hainan Island in southern China had a fruiting body that measured 10.8 metres (35.4 feet) in length and 82–88 cm (2.7–2.9 feet) in width and weighed an estimated 400–500 kg (882–1,102 pounds). It was found growing on the underside of a tree, and at the time it was the largest fruiting body ever recorded for a fungus.
