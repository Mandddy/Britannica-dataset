Gadara, modern Umm Qays,  ancient city of Palestine, a member of the Decapolis, located just southeast of the Sea of Galilee in Jordan. Gadara first appeared in history when it fell to the Seleucid Antiochus the Great (218 bc); the Jewish king Alexander Jannaeus took it after 10 monthsâ€™ siege (c. 100 bc). It was restored by the Roman general Pompey, and Augustus gave it to Herod the Great (30 bc). Archaeological remains include three large theatres, a basilica, a temple, and a colonnaded street.
