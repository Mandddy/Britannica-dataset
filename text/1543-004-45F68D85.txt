Basic oxygen process (&gt;BOP), a steelmaking method in which pure oxygen is blown into a bath of molten blast-furnace iron and scrap. The oxygen initiates a series of intensively exothermic (heat-releasing) reactions, including the oxidation of such impurities as carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and manganese.
The advantages of using pure oxygen instead of air in refining pig iron into steel were recognized as early as 1855 by Henry Bessemer, but the process could not be brought to commercial fruition until the 20th century, when large tonnages of cheap, high-purity oxygen became available. Commercial advantages include high production rates, less labour, and steel with a low nitrogen content. Development of the BOP was initiated in Switzerland by Robert Durrer in the late 1940s. After experimenting with a 2.5-ton pilot unit, Durrer worked with engineers at the Voest company at Linz, Austria, who set up a commercially operating 35-ton converter in 1952. A second unit began operation within a year at Donawitz, also in Austria. Consequently, the BOP was first known as the LD (Linz-Donawitz) process. Within 40 years, virtually all of the steel in Japan and more than half of the steel worldwide was produced by the BOP.
