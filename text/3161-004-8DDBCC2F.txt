Annie Oakley, original name Phoebe Ann Mosey  (born Aug. 13, 1860, Darke county, Ohio, U.S.—died Nov. 3, 1926, Greenville, Ohio) American markswoman who starred in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show, where she was often called “Little Sure Shot.”
Phoebe Ann Mosey (or Moses, per some sources) early developed an amazing proficiency with firearms. As a child, she hunted game with such success that, according to legend, by selling it in Cincinnati, Ohio, she was able to pay off the mortgage on the family farm. When she was 15 she won a shooting match in Cincinnati with Frank E. Butler, a vaudeville marksman. They were married (probably in 1876), and until 1885 they played vaudeville circuits and circuses as “Butler and Oakley” (she apparently took her professional name from a Cincinnati suburb). In April 1885, Annie Oakley, now under her husband’s management, joined “Buffalo Bill” Cody’s Wild West Show. Billed as “Miss Annie Oakley, the Peerless Lady Wing-Shot,” she was one of the show’s star attractions for 16 years, except for a brief period in 1887, when she was with the rival Pawnee Bill’s Frontier Exhibition.
