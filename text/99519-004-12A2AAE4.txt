Joe Williams, original name Joseph Goreed  (born Dec. 12, 1918, Cordele, Ga., U.S.—died March 29, 1999, Las Vegas, Nev.) American singer known for his mastery of jazz, blues, and ballads and for his association with Count Basie in the 1950s.
Williams moved from Georgia to Chicago at the age of three. As a youth he sang with a gospel group. In 1937 he joined clarinetist Jimmie Noone’s band, which was broadcast nationally. Subsequently Williams worked with the big bands of Coleman Hawkins, Lionel Hampton, Andy Kirk, and Red Saunders; he made his recording debut in 1950. Williams was unable at this point to work full time in music; he held a job as backstage doorman at Chicago’s Regal Theater, where he met some of the era’s great jazz musicians.
