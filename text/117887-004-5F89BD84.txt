The state legislature established the institution in 1947 as Texas State University for Negroes, replacing Houston College for Negroes, which had been founded in 1927. The institution was renamed Texas Southern University in 1951. When Heman M. Sweatt, a black postal worker from Houston, filed suit in 1946 after being denied admission into the University of Texas School of Law, the state legislature responded by creating a “separate but equal” law school for blacks at Texas State University in 1947. The law school opened in Austin and moved to Houston after one year; in 1976 it was named for Thurgood Marshall, the U.S. Supreme Court justice who, as a lawyer, successfully argued Sweatt’s case before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1950.
