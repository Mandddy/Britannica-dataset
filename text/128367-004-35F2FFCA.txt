Munia,  any of several small finchlike Asian birds of the mannikin and waxbill groups (family Estrildidae, order Passeriformes). The black-headed munia, or chestnut mannikin (Lonchura malacca, including atricapilla and ferruginosa), is a pest in rice fields from India to Java and the Philippines; as a cage bird it is often called tricolour nun. Others kept as pets include the white-headed munia (L. maja) of Thailand to Java and the green munia, or green tiger finch (Amandava formosa), of India. The white-throated munia is also called silverbill, as are other birds with silver bills. For red munia, see avadavat.
