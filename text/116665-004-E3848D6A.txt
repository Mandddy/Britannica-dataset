White River, also called West Fork White River,  river of central and southern Indiana, U.S. It rises in Randolph county in the east-central part of the state and flows generally westward past Muncie and Anderson for about 65 miles (105 km). Turning southwestward northeast of Indianapolis, it flows through the city and for another 175 miles (280 km) before entering the Wabash River, opposite Mount Carmel, Illinois. Its largest tributary is the East Fork White River (sometimes called the Driftwood Fork), which rises from a combination of streams that join near Columbus in Bartholomew county and flows generally southwestward for about 280 miles (450 km) before its junction with the White near Petersburg; the final 50-mile (80-km) stretch below this confluence is sometimes considered the White proper.
