Manuel José Quintana,  (born April 11, 1772, Madrid, Spain—died March 11, 1857, Madrid) Spanish patriot and Neoclassical poet, esteemed by his countrymen for poems, pamphlets, and proclamations written during the War of Independence from Napoleon. Although he was once regarded as a great poet, Quintana’s reputation has since steadily declined.
After studying law at the University of Salamanca, he went to Madrid to begin his practice. Active in the Napoleonic Wars, he was imprisoned, after the return to Spain of Ferdinand VII, from 1814 to 1820. Released by the revolutionary forces, he later served as tutor to the future queen Isabella II, as director of public instruction, and finally as a senator. In 1855 he was crowned as the national poet by Queen Isabella.
