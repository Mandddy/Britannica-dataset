Manganite, an ore mineral of manganese, basic manganese oxide [MnO(OH)] that forms dark gray to black crystal bundles or fibrous masses. Important deposits exist at Ilfeld, Ilmenau, Siegen, and Horhausen, Ger.; the Lauron and Aure valleys, in France; St. Just, Cornwall, Eng.; and Michigan and California, U.S. As a manganese ore it ranks after pyrolusite and romanechite, to which it readily alters. For detailed physical properties, see oxide mineral (table).
