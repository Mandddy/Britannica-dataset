Charles Wakefield Cadman,  (born Dec. 24, 1881, Johnstown, Pa., U.S.â€”died  Dec. 30, 1946, Los Angeles, Calif.) one of the first American composers to become interested in the music and folklore of the American Indian.
By age 13 Cadman was studying the piano and organ. At about age 19 he met Nellie Richmond Eberhart, who would write most of his song lyrics and opera librettos. In his early 20s he held various jobs, pursuing music studies as he could. From 1908 to 1910 he was music critic for the Pittsburgh Dispatch. A visit to an Omaha Indian reservation reinforced an earlier interest in Indian music. He made recordings of Indian music and from 1909 to 1923 gave lecture-recitals with Tsianina Redfeather, an Indian singer, in both America and Europe.
