Cannonball tree, (Couroupita guianensis), tall, soft-wooded tree, of the family Lecythidaceae, native to northeastern South America and notable for its large, spherical woody fruit, which resembles a rusty cannonball. The tree is also cultivated in the southern regions of North America.
The leaves are oval, oblong, or broadly lance shaped; the leaf margins are smooth or finely toothed. The showy flowers, borne in racemes 60–90 cm (2–3 feet) long, grow straight from the trunk and have concave petals about 5 cm (2 inches) long. They are yellow or red on the outside and crimson or lilac on the inside. The fruit, which grows to 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter, is pulpy on the inside and contains many seeds. The hard shell is used locally to make utensils.
