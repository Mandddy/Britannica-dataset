Nicholas Ridley,  (born c. 1500, /03, South Tynedale, Northumberland, Eng.â€”died  Oct. 16, 1555, Oxford, Oxfordshire) Protestant martyr, one of the finest academic minds in the early English Reformation.
Ridley attended Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, and was ordained a priest (c. 1524). After a period of study in France, he returned to Cambridge, where he settled down to a scholarly career. About 1534 Ridley began to show sympathies with Protestant doctrines, and in 1537 he became one of the chaplains to the prominent Reformer Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury. Elected master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1540, he took a leading part in transforming the university into a Reformist seminary that would soon contribute greatly to the intellectual life of English Protestantism. Meanwhile, he became canon of Canterbury (1541) and of Westminster (1545).
