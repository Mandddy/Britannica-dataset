Harold L. Ickes,  (born March 15, 1874, Frankstown Township, Pa., U.S.â€”died Feb. 3, 1952, Washington, D.C.) U.S. social activist who became a prominent member of the New Deal Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Admitted to the Illinois bar in 1907, Ickes early developed an aroused social conscience; he worked as a volunteer in a settlement house, frequently handled civil liberties cases without pay, and fought for municipal reform and the curbing of public utilities. Vacillating for many years between the two major political parties, he helped swing liberal Republicans to the opposition in the 1932 elections; he was, therefore, a natural choice for secretary of the interior when Roosevelt was seeking a progressive Republican for his Cabinet. Ickes became one of the most energetic and dedicated New Dealers in Washington and a lifelong supporter of the President. In his new post he fought for the preservation of natural resources against exploitation by private interests.
