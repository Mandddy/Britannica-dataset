Butterflyfish, also called butterfly fish,  any of the approximately 115 species of small quick-moving marine fishes in the family Chaetodontidae (order Perciformes). Butterflyfishes are found among tropical reefs around the world but are concentrated in the Indo-Pacific oceanic region. Butterflyfishes are deep-bodied and thin from side to side, with a single dorsal fin and a small mouth with tiny bristlelike teeth. The jaws are sometimes drawn out into a relatively long snout, as in the longnose, or copperband, butterflyfish (Chelmon rostratus) of the Indo-Pacific and the long-snouted, or long-nosed, butterflyfish (Forcipiger flavissimus) of the Atlantic. Most species have strong, prominent spines on the front portions of their dorsal fins.
Butterflyfishes are small, seldom exceeding a length of about 20 cm (8 inches). They move about with a flitting, darting motion and are very brightly coloured. Black and shades of yellow predominate, and markings are often in the form of dark bands and one or more large spots (ocelli) on the dorsal or posterior region that may serve to confuse predators. Butterflyfishes usually frequent shallow inshore waters, where they feed on a variety of crustaceans and on coral polyps.
