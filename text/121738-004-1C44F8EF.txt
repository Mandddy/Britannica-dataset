The name was changed to Florida Military and Collegiate Institute in 1863 to reflect the school’s changing mission; in 1901 it was renamed Florida State College. When Florida’s institutions of higher education were reorganized in 1905, the school became the Florida Female College, open to women only; the male students were moved to the University of Florida in Gainesville. The name was changed to Florida State College for Women in 1909. It became Florida State University in 1947 and at that time reinstituted a coeducational policy.
