Colin Firth, in full Colin Andrew Firth  (born September 10, 1960, Grayshott, Hampshire, England) British actor especially known for his portrayals of aloof characters who gradually shed their reserve to become emotionally available, notably Mr. Darcy in a television adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (1995) and the future King George VI in The King’s Speech (2010).
Firth’s parents were teachers, and the family moved frequently, living in Nigeria, the United Kingdom, and the United States. He acted in school plays, and in 1980 he was accepted to the Drama Centre London (now part of the University of Arts London and Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design). Three years later he made his West End debut, portraying a character based on the British spy Guy Burgess in the play Another Country. In 1984 Firth starred in the film adaptation, though he was cast in a different role. Over the next decade Firth worked steadily, appearing in numerous stage, movie, and television productions. In 1988 he received critical praise for the TV film Tumbledown, in which he portrayed a Scottish soldier who is injured during the Falkland Islands War and endures a difficult recovery. The role earned Firth his first British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award nomination. Notable feature films from this period include Apartment Zero (1988), Valmont (1989), and Circle of Friends (1995).
