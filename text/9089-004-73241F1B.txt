When Tegnér was nine his father died, leaving the family without money. He received his schooling, however, because his talent was generally recognized. He graduated from the University of Lund in 1802 and was appointed professor of Greek there 10 years later. He continued to lecture at Lund until 1824, when he became bishop of Växjö, a position he retained all his life.
