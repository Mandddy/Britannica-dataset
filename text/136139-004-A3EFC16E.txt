Cambrian Period, earliest time division of the Paleozoic Era, extending from 541 to 485.4 million years ago. The Cambrian Period is divided into four stratigraphic series: the Terreneuvian Series (541 million to 521 million years ago), Series 2 (521 million to 509 million years ago), Series 3 (509 million to 497 million years ago), and the Furongian Series (497 million to 485.4 million years ago).
Rocks formed or deposited during this time are assigned to the Cambrian System, which was named in 1835 by English geologist Adam Sedgwick for successions of slaty rocks in southern Wales and southwestern England. These rocks contain the earliest record of abundant and varied life-forms. The corresponding period and system names are derived from Cambria, the Roman name for Wales. As originally described, the Cambrian System was overlain by the Silurian System, which was named, also in 1835, by Scottish geologist Roderick I. Murchison. Subsequent disagreement between Sedgwick and Murchison over the definition and placement of the Cambrian-Silurian boundary led to a bitter controversy that involved many British geologists. The problem persisted until after the deaths of both Sedgwick and Murchison in the 1870s and the eventual adoption of an intervening system, the Ordovician (485.4 million to 443.8 million years ago), which was proposed in 1879 by English geologist Charles Lapworth.
