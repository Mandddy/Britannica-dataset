Yevgeny Abramovich Baratynsky,  Baratynsky also spelled Boratynsky   (born Feb 19 [March 2, New Style], 1800, Mara, Russia—died  June 29 [June 11], 1844, Naples) foremost Russian philosophical poet contemporary with Aleksandr Pushkin. In his poetry he combined an elegant, precise style with spiritual melancholy in dealing with abstract idealistic concepts.
Of noble parentage, Baratynsky was expelled from the imperial corps of pages, entered the army, was commissioned, and retired in 1826. He married and settled at Muranovo, near Moscow. His early romantic lyrics are strongly personal, dreamy, and disenchanted. His narrative poems Eda (1826), Bal (1828; “The Ball”), and Nalozhnitsa (1831; “The Concubine”; rewritten as Tsyganka, “The Gypsy Girl,” 1842) treat the emotions analytically. Tsyganka was attacked by critics of the time as “base” and “coarse.” The poem Na smert Gyote (1832; “On the Death of Goethe”) is one of his masterpieces. Tragic pessimism dominates his later poetry, which is mainly on philosophical and aesthetic themes. Modern critics value his thought more highly than did his contemporaries.
