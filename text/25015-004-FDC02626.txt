Colossus, also called Mark I,  early electronic computer, built during World War II in England. The exigencies of war gave impetus and funding to computer research. In Britain, for example, the impetus was code breaking. The Ultra project was funded with much secrecy to develop the technology necessary to crack ciphers and codes produced by German electromechanical devices such as the Schl√ºsselzusatz SZ40, produced in 1940 by the Lorenz company and code-named Tunny by the British. Colossus was designed by engineer Thomas Flowers to crack Tunny. It was installed at Bletchley Park, a government research centre north of London, in January 1944 and was breaking German ciphers that February. It employed approximately 1,600 vacuum tubes for computations. Successively larger and more-elaborate versions were built over the next two years, and by the end of the war 10 models operated around the clock for Tunny breaking.
