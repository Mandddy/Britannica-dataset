Vieira graduated from Tufts University with a B.A. in English in 1975 and began her career in broadcasting as a radio news announcer. Shortly thereafter, she was hired as an on-camera television reporter for New York City’s WCBS, a CBS (then Columbia Broadcasting System) affiliate. In 1982 she joined CBS’s national news team as a reporter in its Chicago bureau. During the next two decades, Vieira steadily rose through the ranks to become a prominent national journalist. In 1985 she was named chief correspondent for the CBS newsmagazine show West 57th. Four years later she became a coeditor for CBS’s flagship newsmagazine 60 Minutes. In addition to those duties, she regularly contributed to or coanchored several of the network’s other news shows. In 1991 Vieira left 60 Minutes after becoming pregnant with her second child, and in 1993 she left CBS altogether. She joined ABC as chief correspondent for the news program Turning Point.
