University of Tokyo, Japanese Tōkyō Daigaku, formerly (1886–1947) Tokyo Imperial University,  coeducational, state-financed institution of higher learning in Tokyo, the largest of Tokyo’s more than 50 universities and colleges. Founded in 1877 as the first Japanese institution of higher learning formed on a Western model, it incorporated three schools established in the late 18th and 19th centuries devoted, respectively, to the Chinese classics, Western studies, and Western medicine. The university was reconstructed after the great earthquake and fire of 1923. After World War II it was renamed the University of Tokyo (1947) and then reorganized (1949). The university—popularly called Tōdai in Japan—is the most prestigious in the country, and admittance to it almost guarantees students attractive job offers upon graduation. Of note is the high proportion of government bureaucrats who are Tōdai alumni.
The University of Tokyo has faculties of agriculture, economics, education, engineering, law, letters, medicine, pharmacology, and science, and it has a college of arts and sciences and a graduate school. The university has institutes for research in molecular and cellular biology, earthquakes, nuclear studies, solid-state physics, cosmic radiation, medical science, oceanography, journalism and communications, historiography, culture, and social science. In the early 21st century the university had about 28,000 students.
