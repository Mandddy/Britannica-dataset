Steve Allen, byname of Stephen Valentine Patrick William Allen  (born December 26, 1921, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 30, 2000, Encino, California) pioneer American television entertainer, versatile author, songwriter, and comedian who performed in radio, motion pictures, and theatre as well as television. Allen wrote a sidebar on The Tonight Show for the Encyclopædia Britannica (see Sidebar: The Tonight Show).
Allen’s mother was a comedian, and his father was a singer and foil for her in their vaudeville act. When Allen was 18 months old, his father died, and the young Allen moved to Chicago to live with his mother’s family. He became a radio actor while in high school and studied journalism at two colleges before becoming a radio announcer in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1942. In 1948 he scored his first major success as host of a late-night radio show on station KNX in Los Angeles, California. The show provided Allen with a showcase for his spontaneous humour and featured his ad-libbed repartee with members of the studio audience, a device Allen would continue to employ effectively on his television talk shows.
