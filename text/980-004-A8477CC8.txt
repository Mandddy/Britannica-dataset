Goosefish, any of about 25 species of anglerfishes of the family Lophiidae (order Lophiiformes), found in warm and temperate seas around the world. Goosefishes are soft and flabby with wide, flattened heads and slender, tapering bodies. They may grow to a maximum length and weight of about 1.8 metres (6 feet) and 34 kilograms (75 pounds). They have very large mouths and large, sharp teeth. Their heads are topped by a row of three isolated dorsal fin spines, the first of which is formed into a “fishing pole” tipped by a fleshy “bait,” structures characteristic of all anglerfishes.
Goosefishes generally live on the bottom, lying quietly or moving slowly about. They are carnivorous, and commonly “fish” for their prey, luring it near enough with the “bait” to be taken with a sudden snap. Fishes form the main part of the diet; various invertebrates and seabirds are also eaten. Goosefishes are sold as food in some regions. Species include the American Atlantic Lophius americanus; the European L. piscatorius, known as angler, or monkfish; and the Oriental Lophiomus setigerus, the ankō of Japan.
