Pinnacle,  in architecture, vertical ornament of pyramidal or conical shape, crowning a buttress, spire, or other architectural member. A pinnacle is distinguished from a finial by its greater size and complexity and from a tower or spire by its smaller size and subordinate architectural role. A tower may be decorated with pinnacles, each one capped by a finial.
Simple pinnacles were used on Romanesque churches, especially to mask the abrupt transition from square tower to polygonal spire; but they were far more prominent in developed Gothic architecture and decoration, in which they were used to give vertical emphasis and to break up hard outlines. They appeared at every major corner of a building, flanked gables, and decorated parapets and buttresses. Some of the most striking pinnacles crown the piers of flying buttresses, on which, although primarily decorative, they enhance the stability of the buttresses, helping to counteract the lateral thrust of the vault. The buttress pinnacles around the choir of Notre-Dame at Paris and the magnificent 80-foot (24-metre) pinnacles at Reims Cathedral (13th century) are representative examples.
