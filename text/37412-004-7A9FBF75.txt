Saint Leo III,  (born , Rome—died June 12, 816, canonized 1673; feast day June 12) pope from 795 to 816.
Leo was a cardinal when elected to succeed Pope Adrian I on December 26, 795; he was consecrated the next day. Unlike Adrian, who had tried to maintain independence in the growing estrangement between East and West by balancing the Byzantine emperor against Charlemagne, Leo immediately yielded to Charlemagne by recognizing him as patricius of the Romans. On April 25, 799, during a Roman procession, Leo was physically attacked by assailants incited by Adrian’s supporters, who accused him of misconduct and whose ultimate plan was to blind Leo and remove his tongue, thus disqualifying him for the papacy. He fled across the Alps to his protector, Charlemagne, at Paderborn. Exactly what was negotiated there is unknown, but Leo was safely escorted back to Rome in November by a commission that discredited the complaints against him and arrested and deported his accusers.
