Mark McGwire, in full Mark David McGwire, byname Big Mac  (born October 1, 1963, Pomona, California, U.S.) professional baseball player, considered one of the most powerful hitters in the history of the game. In 1998 he set a major league record for most home runs in a season (70), breaking Roger Maris’s mark of 61. See Researcher’s Note: Baseball’s problematic single-season home run record.
As a senior in high school, McGwire attracted more attention with his pitching than with his swing. The Montreal Expos drafted him as a pitcher in 1981, but instead he attended the University of Southern California, where he moved to first base, a position he was to maintain in the majors. Selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 1984 draft, McGwire joined the major league club in 1987 and quickly displayed the strength that would become his trademark. His 49 home runs that year set a rookie record and helped earn him American League Rookie of the Year honours. In 1989 his .343 postseason batting average guided Oakland to the World Series championship. Injuries, however, soon plagued McGwire, and from 1993 to 1995 he missed 242 games. In 1996, after briefly contemplating retirement, he became the 13th player to hit 50 home runs in a single season. The following year he was traded to the National League’s St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he posted 58 homers and with whom he elected to continue playing, ruling out free agency.
