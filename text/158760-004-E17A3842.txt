Cartouche, in architecture, ornamentation in scroll form, applied especially to elaborate frames around tablets or coats of arms. By extension, the word is applied to any oval shape or even to a decorative shield, whether scroll-like in appearance or not. The oval frame enclosing Egyptian hieroglyphs that represent a name is also called a cartouche.
