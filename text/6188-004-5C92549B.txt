Josephine Baker, original name Freda Josephine McDonald  (born June 3, 1906, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.â€”died April 12, 1975, Paris, France) American-born French dancer and singer who symbolized the beauty and vitality of black American culture, which took Paris by storm in the 1920s.
Baker grew up fatherless and in poverty. Between the ages of 8 and 10 she was out of school, helping to support her family. As a child Baker developed a taste for the flamboyant that was later to make her famous. As an adolescent she became a dancer, touring at 16 with a dance troupe from Philadelphia. In 1923 she joined the chorus in a road company performing the musical comedy Shuffle Along and then moved to New York City, where she advanced steadily through the show Chocolate Dandies on Broadway and the floor show of the Plantation Club.
