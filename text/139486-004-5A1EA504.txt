Wayne Rooney, in full Wayne Mark Rooney  (born October 24, 1985, Liverpool, England) English professional football (soccer) player who rose to international football stardom as a teenager while playing with the English Premier League powerhouse Manchester United.
Rooney made his professional debut with his local club Everton at age 16, becoming the youngest goal scorer in Premier League history in his first season (the record has since been surpassed). After two years playing for Everton, he transferred to Manchester United in 2004. With Manchester the precocious young striker quickly became one of the most popular football stars in the United Kingdom, as well as fodder for the country’s notorious tabloid industry along with his girlfriend (later his wife) Coleen McLoughlin. The couple’s late-night exploits and home life were widely disseminated by the press, and McLoughlin (Coleen Rooney from 2008) was able to parlay her exposure into a media career.
