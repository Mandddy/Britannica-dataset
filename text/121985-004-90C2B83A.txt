Jânio da Silva Quadros,  (born Jan. 25, 1917, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso, Braz.—died  Feb. 16, 1992, São Paulo) Brazilian politician who unexpectedly resigned the presidency after serving only seven months (Jan. 31–Aug. 25, 1961). A colourful and sometimes eccentric populist, he campaigned with a broom as a symbol of his pledge to “sweep out corruption.”
Quadros graduated from the University of São Paulo in 1939. He practiced law and taught Portuguese history and literature before entering politics in 1945. After Quadros was elected to the São Paulo city council (1947), he adopted the broom for his successful 1950 campaign for state deputy of São Paulo. As mayor of São Paulo (1953–54), he balanced the city budget in less than a year, and he had similar economic success as governor of the state (1954–58). A charismatic campaigner, he attracted the votes of the poor by affecting the image of a commoner with a rumpled appearance but also retained the support of much of the business community and other economic elites.
