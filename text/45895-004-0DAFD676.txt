Gregory XIV, original name Niccolò Sfondrati  (born Feb. 11, 1535, Somma, near Milan [Italy]—died  Oct. 16, 1591, Rome, Papal States) pope from 1590 to 1591.
Appointed bishop of Cremona in the duchy of Milan (1560), he was made cardinal by Pope Gregory XIII (1583) and elected pope on Dec. 5, 1590. He continued the policies of his immediate predecessors, particularly in furthering the internal reform of the church. During his reign of less than one year, his nepotism angered the cardinals while the Roman masses resented the food shortages and lawlessness that prevailed.
