Surrey, administrative and historic county of southeastern England. It is situated just southwest of London, adjoining the River Thames. Surrey is bordered to the northwest by Berkshire, to the northeast by the Greater London conurbation, to the east by Kent, to the south by Sussex, and to the west by Hampshire. The administrative centre is at Kingston upon Thames.
The administrative county comprises 11 districts: Mole Valley and Tandridge and the boroughs of Elmbridge, Epsom and Ewell, Guildford, Reigate and Banstead, Runnymede, Spelthorne, Surrey Heath, Waverley, and Woking. The administrative county of Surrey occupies a considerably smaller area than the historic county. The northeastern part of the historic county now lies within Greater London, forming all or most of the boroughs of Croydon, Kingston upon Thames, Lambeth, Merton, Richmond upon Thames, Southwark, Sutton, and Wandsworth. That history accounts for the location of the countyâ€™s administrative centre in the London borough of Kingston upon Thames. In addition, a small part of the historic county of Surrey, including Gatwick Airport and its immediate environs, lies within the borough of Crawley in the administrative county of West Sussex. Whereas those parts of other administrative units belong to the historic county of Surrey, the borough of Spelthorne, though assigned to the administrative county of Surrey, forms part of the historic county of Middlesex.
