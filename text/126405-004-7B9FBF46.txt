Swedish Academy, Swedish organization devoted to the preservation and elevation of the Swedish language and its literature. The academy awards various literary prizes, including the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The academy was founded by King Gustav III on April 5, 1786, in Stockholm. The goal of the organization was defined as working for the “purity, vigour and majesty” of the Swedish language. This was to be accomplished by such activities as producing a dictionary and grammar of the Swedish language, recognizing the achievements of Swedes in “eloquence and poetry” in annual competitions, and minting an annual coin to honour an eminent Swede. The poetry competitions have not been held frequently, yet the academy awards more than 10 other literary prizes, such as the Swedish Language Prize for scholarship in the language and the Swedish Teaching Prize for inspiring interest in the language and literature of Sweden in younger generations. Most importantly, the academy awards the Nobel Prize for Literature, as requested by Alfred Nobel in his will.
