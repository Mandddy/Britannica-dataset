Rio Grande do Sul, southernmost estado (state) of Brazil, bordered by the state of Santa Catarina (north), Argentina (west), Uruguay (south), and the Atlantic Ocean (east). The capital of Porto Alegre is the state’s main industrial area and port. Rio Grande do Sul is a major agricultural and livestock region.
The region was originally thinly inhabited by Tupí-Guaraní, Ge, and Guaycurú Indians. It was first explored and colonized by the Portuguese during the late 17th century. Long disputed between Spain and Portugal, the region was the site of intermittent warfare between 1754 and 1870. The region was also wracked by wars of secession during the 19th century.
