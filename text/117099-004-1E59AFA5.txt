Dog racing, also called greyhound racing,  the racing of greyhounds around an enclosed track in pursuit of an electrically controlled and propelled mechanical hare (rabbit). Dog racing is a 20th-century outgrowth of the older sport of coursing, in which dogs hunted by sight rather than scent.
O.P. Smith demonstrated dog racing in 1919 at Emeryville, Calif., and the first track opened there that year. The sport was introduced in England in 1926 and became more popular there than in the United States. Dog racing later spread to such other countries as Ireland, Belgium, and Mexico.
