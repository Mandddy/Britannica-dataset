Victoria River,  longest river in Northern Territory, Australia. The river rises in low sand hills at 1,200 feet (370 m) elevation north of Hooker Creek. It flows north and northwest for about 350 miles (560 km) across a region of hills and basins to enter Joseph Bonaparte Gulf of the Timor Sea via a 16-mile- (25.5-kilometre-) wide mouth at Queens Channel. Fed by its major tributaries—the West Baines, Wickham, Gordon, Armstrong, and Camfield rivers—the Victoria drains a basin of 27,060 square miles (70,090 square km). Its upper course, seasonally intermittent, flows through some of Australia’s largest cattle ranges.
Reached in 1839 by Captain J.C. Wickham of the HMS Beagle, the river was named in honour of Victoria, who had been crowned queen of Great Britain in 1837. The river is only 500 feet (150 m) above sea level 300 miles (480 km) from the coast; its last 100 miles (160 km) are tidal, of which the lowest 50 are navigable by boats of up to 10-foot (3-metre) draft.
