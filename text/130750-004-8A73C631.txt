Yajna, (
        Sanskrit: “sacrifice”) also spelled yajña,  in Hinduism, offerings to the gods based on rites prescribed in the earliest scriptures of ancient India, the Vedas, in contrast to puja, a later practice that may include image worship and other devotional practices.
A yajna is always purposeful, even though the aim may be as general as sustaining the natural order of the universe. Correct performance of the ritual and recitation of the necessary mantras, or sacred formulas, is considered essential, and the performer and the objects employed must all be in a high state of purity. The arbiters of such ritual requirements are the professional class of priests, the Brahmans, who are still required to officiate at all important public yajnas. Many Hindu householders continue to perform the mahayajnas, the five daily domestic offerings.
