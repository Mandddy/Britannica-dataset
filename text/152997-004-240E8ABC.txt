Richard Harris,  (born October 1, 1930, Limerick, Ireland—died October 25, 2002, London, England) Irish actor of stage and screen who became known as much for his offstage indulgences as for his flamboyant performances.
The son of a miller, Harris studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and made his stage debut in 1956. His first film was Shake Hands with the Devil (1959), which was followed by noted supporting performances in The Guns of Navarone (1961) and Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). He became an international star with his Oscar-nominated portrayal of a brutal, self-centred rugby player in This Sporting Life (1963), a performance still regarded by many as Harris’s finest. The film revealed Harris to be an actor who excelled at excess, a talent for which he was praised when playing roles that called for flamboyance—and for which he was derided as a “ham” when playing roles that required subtlety.
