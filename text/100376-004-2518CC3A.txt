Sun bear, also called bruang, honey bear, or Malayan sun bear,  smallest member of the family Ursidae, found in Southeast Asian forests. The bear (Helarctos, or Ursus, malayanus) is often tamed as a pet when young but becomes bad-tempered and dangerous as an adult. It weighs only 27–65 kg (59–143 pounds) and grows 1–1.2 m (3.3–4 feet) long with a 5-centimetre (2-inch) tail. Its large forepaws bear long, curved claws, which it uses for tearing or digging in its search for insect nests and colonies, particularly those of bees and termites. Other items of its omnivorous diet include fruit, honey, and small vertebrates.
Generally nocturnal, the tree-climbing sun bear is shy and retiring but quite intelligent. It has an orange-yellow-coloured chest crescent that according to legend represents the rising sun. Other light features (often including its muzzle and feet) contrast with its black coat of short, coarse fur.
