Indian pipe, also called corpse plant, convulsion root, or fits root,  (Monotropa uniflora), nongreen herb, of the heath family (Ericaceae). It lives in close association with a fungus from which it acquires most of its nutrition; some of this comes from trees with which the fungus is also closely associated. It occurs in Asia and throughout North America and is commonly found in moist, shady areas.
The plant arises from a tangled mass of rootlets, grows 15–25 cm (6–10 inches) tall, and is white, pinkish, or (rarely) red; if it dries out, it turns black. A single, odourless, drooping, cup-shaped flower with four or five petals is borne at the tip of the stalk. The leaves are represented only by small scales, and the fruit is an oval capsule.
