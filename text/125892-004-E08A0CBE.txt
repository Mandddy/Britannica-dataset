Sclerophyll,  type of vegetation characterized by hard, leathery, evergreen foliage that is specially adapted to prevent moisture loss. Broad-leaved sclerophyll vegetation, including species such as holly (Ilex), is known as Mediterranean vegetation because it is characteristic of regions with a Mediterranean climateâ€”hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Narrow-leaved sclerophyll vegetation is characteristic of species such as pines.
