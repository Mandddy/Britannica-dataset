François Couperin, byname Couperin le Grand (“the Great”)   (born November 10, 1668, Paris, France—died September 11, 1733, Paris) French composer and harpsichordist, the most renowned of the Couperin dynasty of 17th- and 18th-century musicians. He was the nephew of Louis Couperin.
Although François Couperin was only 10 years old when his father, Charles Couperin, died, the wardens of the Church of Saint-Gervais in Paris reserved his father’s office of organist for him until he was 18. The boy took over the post before his 18th birthday and in 1693 became one of the four organists of the royal chapel. One honour followed another: harpsichord teacher to the royal children (1694) and the survivance (right to succeed) of Jean-Henri d’Anglebert as court harpsichordist (1717). By 1723 Couperin’s health obliged him to bestow the survivance at Saint-Gervais upon his cousin Nicolas, and in 1730 the d’Anglebert survivance went to his daughter Marguerite-Antoinette.
