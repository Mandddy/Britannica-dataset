Atropine,  poisonous, crystalline substance belonging to a class of compounds known as alkaloids and used in medicine. Its chief use is in ophthalmology, in which it is applied locally to the eye to dilate the pupil in the examination of the retina or to break up or prevent adhesions between the lens and the iris. It gives symptomatic relief from hay fever and head colds by drying up nasal and lachrymal secretions. Atropine also is used as an antidote for poisoning with organophosphate nerve toxins, including tabun and sarin.
Because atropine relaxes intestinal spasms resulting from stimulation of the parasympathetic portion of the autonomic nervous system, it is prescribed in certain types of bowel distress and is included in a number of proprietary cathartics. It is used in the treatment of childhood bedwetting and is occasionally employed to relieve ureteral and biliary spasms. Atropine is no longer used as a respiratory stimulant. In the treatment of bronchial asthma to relax bronchial spasms, it has been largely replaced by epinephrine.
