Nipsey Russell, byname of Julius Russell  (born Oct. 13, 1924, Atlanta, Ga., U.S.â€”died Oct. 2, 2005, New York, N.Y.) American actor and comedian known for the clever impromptu verses that he created for his television appearances.
Russell was raised in Atlanta, where he began performing as a child in a singing and dancing troupe. He served in the army as a medic during World War II and later returned to college to finish a degree in English at the University of Cincinnati in 1946. After touring comedy clubs in the the Midwest, Russell moved to New York, where he attracted attention for his nightclub comedy performances. He cultivated a persona distinct from those of other comedians of the 1950s, eschewing the increasing vulgarity then popular in favour of sharply observed social commentary and elaborate wordplay. As the burgeoning civil rights movement gathered strength in the 1960s, Russell more frequently incorporated material about racism into his onstage commentary.
