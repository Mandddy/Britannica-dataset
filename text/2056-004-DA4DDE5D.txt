Lantern, in architecture, originally an openwork timber construction placed on top of a building to admit light and allow smoke to escape. Something of this idea persists in medieval examples such as the lantern above the central octagon of Ely Cathedral (14th century). The term lantern soon came to refer to the open top story of a tower, because such a construction resembled a lamp container and because beacons were occasionally placed there.
In Renaissance and Baroque architecture, lantern came to mean the small cupola-like structure, usually with decorative arcades, mounted on top of a dome. Although at times its function is to admit light to the interior, it is essentially a proportional element in the visual design. Typical are the lanterns capping the domes of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore (the Duomo) in Florence (1436–71), St. Peter’s in Rome (1506), St. Paul’s Cathedral in London (1689), and the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
