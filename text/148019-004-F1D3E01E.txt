Dike, also called dyke or geological dike,  in geology, tabular or sheetlike igneous body that is often oriented vertically or steeply inclined to the bedding of preexisting intruded rocks; similar bodies oriented parallel to the bedding of the enclosing rocks are called sills. A dike set is composed of several parallel dikes; when the number of dikes is large, the term dike swarm is used. Dikes have a wide range of rock compositions. They commonly have a porphyritic texture, i.e., larger crystals within a finer-grained groundmass, indicating two periods of crystallization.
Although dikes may range in size from a few centimetres to greater than 10 metres (about 33 feet) in width, they average between 0.3 and 6 metres (between about 1 and 20 feet) wide. The length of a dike usually depends upon how far it can be traced across the surface; dikes can be up to hundreds of miles long. The worldâ€™s longest dike is the Great Dike of Zimbabwe, which stretches for more than 550 km (about 342 miles) southwest to northeast across the centre of the country.
