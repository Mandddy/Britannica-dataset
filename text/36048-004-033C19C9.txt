Ladislas I, also called Saint Ladislas, Hungarian Szent László  (born June 27, 1040, Poland—died  July 29, 1095, Nitra, Slovakia; canonized 1192; feast day June 27) king of Hungary who greatly expanded the boundaries of the kingdom and consolidated it internally; no other Hungarian king was so generally beloved by the people.
The son of Béla I of Hungary and the Polish princess Rycheza (Ryksa), Ladislas was born in exile. Returning to Hungary, he and his brother Géza refused to contest the throne against their cousin Salomon; however, they quarreled with him and drove him from the country (1073). Géza took the throne, and, on his death, in 1077, Ladislas succeeded him as king of Hungary.
