Tavern, an establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold for consumption on the premises. Tavern keeping has paralleled the growth of trade, travel, and industry throughout history and virtually worldwide. The Code of Hammurabi of ancient Babylonia (c. 1750 bce) provided that the death penalty could be imposed upon a proprietor for diluting beer. In ancient Greece the lesche, which was primarily a local club, served meals to strangers as well as to its local members. By the 5th century bce there were sumptuous Greek establishments called phatnai that served a local and transient clientele of traders, envoys, and government officials.
In ancient Rome no man of any social standing could be seen in a tavern, although one type of establishment, the lupanar, flourished behind locked doors on the quietest of side streets, and men with veiled heads entered in the dark of night to dine, drink, or gamble. Nor was the reputation undeserved, for the deversoria, tabernae, cauponae, and bibulae of republican and imperial Rome were haunts of the jaded and degraded at best and of criminal types at worst. Yet cooked delicacies and full meals were traditionally served in the caupona (low-class inn) and taberna meritoria (better-class tavern). These were long chambers having vaulted ceilings, with serving boys standing at semiattention and the proprietor sitting at a raised platform at one end.
