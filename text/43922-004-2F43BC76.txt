Caddy, container for tea. A corrupt form of the Malay kati, a weight of a little more than a pound (or about half a kilogram), the word was applied first to porcelain jars filled with tea and imported into England from China. Many caddies made from silver, copper, brass, pewter, and other decorative materials, such as veneers of tortoiseshell or ivory on wood, were made in the 18th century.
When the price of tea dropped considerably in the 1780s, larger tea caddies were made, and wood became the commonest material. The form of the wooden caddy was a box or casket with hinged lid and a lock, fitted with lidded compartments for tea and one or two glass bowls for sugar and for blending the tea.
