Quail, any of roughly 130 species of small short-tailed game birds classified in the families Phasianidae and Odontophoridae (order Galliformes), resembling partridges but generally smaller and less robust. The 95 species of Old World quail are classified in Phasianidae in either of two subfamilies, Phasianinae or Perdicinae. New World quail—at least 32 species whose members more nearly resemble Old World partridges—constitute the family Odontophoridae.
Quail prefer open country and brushy borders. In spring the hen lays about 12 roundish eggs, which the male may help incubate. The young remain with their parents the first summer. Quail eat mainly seeds and berries but also take leaves, roots, and some insects. Their flesh is considered a delicacy, as are their eggs.
