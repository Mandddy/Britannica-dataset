Fair, temporary market where buyers and sellers gather to transact business. A fair is held at regular intervals, generally at the same location and time of year, and it usually lasts for several days or even weeks. Its primary function is the promotion of trade. Historically, fairs displayed many different kinds of products in specific commodity or industrial groupings. The older specialty fair evolved into the more modern trade show. Participation in contemporary trade shows is confined to exhibitors representing one industry or even just specialized segments of an industry.
Historically, fairs were created to solve the early problems of distribution. They provided an opportunity for the demonstration of skills and crafts, for the exchange of ideas, and for the bartering of goods. They concentrated supply and demand in certain places at certain times. Fairs were a fixture of the Roman Empire, and the Romans introduced markets and fairs into northern Europe to encourage trade within their conquered provinces. When the Western Roman Empire disintegrated in the late 5th century, virtually all organized commerce in Europe ceased until the late 7th century. Trade revived under Charlemagne, and fairs eventually evolved from some of the local markets, particularly at points of major caravan route intersections and wherever people congregated for religious festivals. The methods of commerce introduced at such fairs became widespread, and the rules of the fair eventually became the basis of European business law.
