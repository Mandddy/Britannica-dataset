Leopoldo Alas, in full Leopoldo Alas y Ureña, byname Clarín  (born April 25, 1852, Zamora, Spain—died June 13, 1901, Oviedo) novelist, journalist, and the most influential literary critic in late 19th-century Spain. His biting and often-bellicose articles, sometimes called paliques (“chitchat”), and his advocacy of liberalism, anticlericalism, and literary naturalism not only made him Spain’s most feared critical voice but also created many enemies who later obscured his fame.
After studying law in Madrid, he went to the University of Oviedo in 1870, received his degree, and took a position in the university as professor of law and political economy, a post he held until his death. He published thousands of articles in national magazines and newspapers, through which he cultivated drama, poetry, and fiction. These articles were collected in some 30 volumes, which occasionally mixed articles with short stories, as in Solos de Clarín (1881; “Solos of Clarín”).
