Bayer AG, German chemical and pharmaceutical company founded in 1863 by Friedrich Bayer (1825–80), who was a chemical salesman, and Johann Friedrich Weskott (1821–76), who owned a dye company. Company headquarters, originally in Barmen (now Wuppertal), have been in Leverkusen, north of Cologne, since 1912.
The company was originally called Friedr. Bayer et comp. and manufactured dyestuffs; in 1881 it was incorporated as Farbenfabriken vormals Friedr. Bayer &amp; Co. Aspirin, the chance invention of Bayer chemist Felix Hoffmann (1868–1946), was introduced by the company in 1899. In 1912 Carl Duisberg (1861–1935), a chemist, became Bayer’s general director and soon began spearheading the movement that would result in 1925 in the consolidation of Germany’s chemical industries known as IG Farben; Duisberg was IG Farben’s first chairman, and Bayer remained within the cartel until it was dissolved by the Allies in 1945. In 1951 an independent Bayer was reestablished as Farbenfabriken Bayer Aktiengesellschaft; the current name was adopted in 1972. From 1981 to 1999 Bayer held a controlling interest in the Agfa-Gevaert Group, a German and Belgian producer of photographic equipment and film, magnetic tape, and photocopying and duplicating machines.
