Konstantin, baron von Neurath,  (born Feb. 2, 1873, Klein-Glattbach, Ger.—died Aug. 14, 1956, Enzweihingen, W.Ger.) German diplomat who was Adolf Hitler’s foreign minister from 1933 to 1938.
After studying law at the Universities of Tübingen and Berlin, Neurath entered the German foreign service in 1903. After World War I he served as minister to Denmark (from 1919), ambassador to Italy (from 1922), and ambassador to Great Britain (from 1930). From June 1932 he was foreign minister in the Papen and Schleicher cabinets and retained his post after Hitler became chancellor in 1933. In this post Neurath lent a veneer of conservative respectability to Hitler’s expansionist foreign policy. In February 1938 he was ousted by Hitler in favour of Joachim von Ribbentrop, and in March 1939 he was appointed Reichsprotektor for Bohemia and Moravia. During his tenure of office there, he abolished the Czech political parties and trade unions, instituted the Nürnberg racial laws in the protectorate, and made Czechoslovakian industry work for the German war effort. Nevertheless, in September 1941 Neurath was told by Hitler that his rule was “too lenient” and was dismissed.
