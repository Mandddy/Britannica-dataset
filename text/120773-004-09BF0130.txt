Santa Clara University is the oldest institution of higher education in California. The school was founded on the site of the Santa Clara de Asís mission, originally established by Franciscans in 1777. Spanish-style buildings dominate campus architecture. The Adobe Lodge, built in 1822 and restored in 1981, is the oldest building on campus. Mission properties were secularized in 1836, and by midcentury increased migration to California had provided impetus for creating a school. Jesuit priests founded Santa Clara College in 1851; it was chartered in 1855, and the first bachelor’s degree was granted in 1857. In 1912 Santa Clara was elevated to university status. The mission church was destroyed in a fire in 1926, and another was erected in 1928. Women were first admitted in 1961. Notable alumni include former California governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., and politician Leon Panetta.
