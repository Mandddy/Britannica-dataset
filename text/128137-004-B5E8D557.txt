Encke’s Comet, also called Comet Encke,  faint comet having the shortest orbital period (about 3.3 years) of any known; it was also only the second comet (after Halley’s) to have its period established. The comet was first observed in 1786 by French astronomer Pierre Méchain. In 1819 German astronomer Johann Franz Encke deduced that sightings of apparently different comets in 1786, 1795, 1805, and 1818 were in fact appearances of the same comet and calculated its short orbital period. The comet was named in his honour, though usually comets are named after their discoverers. Encke also found that the comet’s orbital period was decreasing by about 2.5 hours every revolution and showed that this behaviour could not be explained by gravitational perturbations (slight changes in an orbit) caused by the planets. American astronomer Fred Whipple explained it in 1950 as the effect of jet forces produced by sublimation of water ice on the surface of the comet’s nucleus, in combination with the rotation of the nucleus.
