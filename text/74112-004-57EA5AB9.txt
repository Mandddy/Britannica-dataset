The city is also a major junction on the Western Railway, with lines running to Mumbai, Delhi, and the Kathiawar Peninsula. Pop.

The city was founded in 1411 by the Muslim ruler of Gujarat, Sultan Aḥmad Shah, next to the older Hindu town of Asawal. Ahmadabad grew larger and wealthier for a century, but dynastic decay and anarchy eventually brought about a decline, and the city was captured in 1572 by the Mughal emperor Akbar. Its renewed eminence under the Mughals ceased with the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. Ahmadabad’s further decline was arrested by the British annexation of Gujarat in 1818. The city’s first cotton mills were opened in 1859–61, and Ahmadabad grew to become one of the most populous cities and largest inland industrial centres in India. The city became the temporary capital of Gujarat state in 1960, but the state administration was moved to Gandhinagar in 1970. In 2001 the city was rocked by a massive earthquake that destroyed hundreds of homes and several historic buildings; up to 20,000 people were killed.
