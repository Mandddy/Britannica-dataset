Brown University, private, coeducational institution of higher learning in Providence, R.I., U.S., one of the Ivy League schools. It was first chartered in Warren, R.I., in 1764 as Rhode Island College, a Baptist institution for men. The school moved to Providence in 1770 and adopted its present name in 1804 in honour of benefactor Nicholas Brown. Francis Wayland, president of Brown from 1827 to 1855, broadened the curriculum by expanding electives, adding modern languages, and improving laboratory equipment. In 1971 the university became coeducational by merging with the affiliated Pembroke College. It consists of an undergraduate college and graduate and medical schools. In an unconventional approach to fulfilling degree requirements, undergraduate students are expected to design their own interdisciplinary program of study, though most do so within one of more than 70 established academic concentrations. Total enrollment is approximately 7,600.
