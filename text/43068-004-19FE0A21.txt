Vanga-shrike, also called Vanga,  any of the 15 species of Madagascan birds constituting the bird family Vangidae (order Passeriformes). The coral-billed nuthatch is sometimes included. They are 13 to 30 cm (5 to 12 inches) long, with wings and tails of moderate length. The hook-tipped bill is stout and of remarkably variable shape and length, much like the variability among Darwinâ€™s finches, which are similarly isolated. Most species are glossy black or blue above and white below; some have white heads or have reddish brown or gray markings (sexes similar). They make cup nests in trees or brush. The hook-billed vanga-shrike (Vanga curvirostris) is a big-billed form that catches tree frogs and lizards. The smallest species is the red-tailed vanga-shrike, or tit-shrike (Calicalicus madagascariensis).
