Rainer Werner Fassbinder,  (born May 31, 1946, Bad Wörishofen, Germany—died June 10, 1982, Munich, West Germany) motion-picture and theatre director, writer, and actor who was an important force in postwar West German cinema. His socially and politically conscious films often explore themes of oppression and despair.
Fassbinder left school at age 16 and became involved with Munich’s Action-Theatre, an avant-garde repertory group for which he wrote, acted, and directed. When the company was closed by police in May 1968, Fassbinder founded the “anti-teater” troupe that produced original works and unusual stage versions of literary classics. Many of the actors with whom he worked in both companies later starred in several of his films.
