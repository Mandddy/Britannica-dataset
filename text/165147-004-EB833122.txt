Knute Rockne, in full Knute Kenneth Rockne  (born March 4, 1888, Voss, Norway—died March 31, 1931, Chase county, Kansas, U.S.) Norwegian-born American gridiron football coach who built the University of Notre Dame in Indiana into a major power in college football and became the intercollegiate sport’s first true celebrity coach.
In 1893 Rockne moved to Chicago with his family, and in 1910 he entered Notre Dame, where he played end on the football team and was also a track star. The 1913 game with Army, in which passes from Charles (“Gus”) Dorais to Rockne led to an upset victory by Notre Dame, is generally credited with popularizing the forward pass, legal since 1906 but not yet widely adopted. Following his graduation in 1914, Rockne taught chemistry and served as assistant football coach at Notre Dame under Jess Harper, becoming head coach in 1918 as well as athletic director.
