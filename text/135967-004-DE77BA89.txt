Staatliche Antikensammlungen, English State Collections of Antiquities,  Bavarian museum of antiquities in Munich, noted for its collection of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. It has one of the world’s largest collections of vases from the ancient Mediterranean.
The Staatliche Antikensammlungen museum is located in the Kunstareal (“Art District”) in Munich’s city centre and houses Bavaria’s collection of Classical and Etruscan antiquities. The building, with its Corinthian columns, was designed by architect Georg Friedrich Ziebland and was completed in 1848 as part of the Königsplatz, a square of Neoclassical buildings commissioned by Bavarian King Ludwig I. It was severely damaged in World War II but was restored and reopened in 1967, when it was used to house the Staatliche Antikensammlungen.
