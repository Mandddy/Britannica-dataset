Lance Armstrong,  (born September 18, 1971, Plano, Texas, U.S.) American cyclist, who was the only rider to win seven Tour de France titles (1999â€“2005) but who was later stripped of all his titles after an investigation revealed that he was the key figure in a wide-ranging doping conspiracy while he compiled his Tour victories.
Armstrong entered sports at a young age, excelling in both swimming and cycling, and by the time he was a teenager he was competing in triathlons and swimming competitions. Before his high-school graduation the junior national team of the U.S. Cycling Federation had recruited him. Armstrong competed in Moscow at the Junior World Championships and in 1990 won the U.S. Amateur Championships. In 1992 he turned professional when he joined the Motorola team, and one year later he became the second youngest man to win in world road racing. Armstrong won stages of the Tour de France in both 1993 and 1995 but withdrew from three of four Tours he attempted from 1993 to 1996.
