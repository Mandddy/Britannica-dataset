Dniester River, Ukrainian Dnistro, Russian Dnestr, Romanian Nistrul, Moldovan Nistru, Turkish Turla,  river of southwestern Ukraine and of Moldova, rising on the north side of the Carpathian Mountains and flowing south and east for 840 miles (1,352 km) to the Black Sea near Odessa. It is the second longest river in Ukraine and the main water artery of Moldova.
The Dniester and its tributaries drain a long narrow basin that is about 28,000 square miles (72,000 square km) in area but is nowhere more than about 60–70 miles (100–110 km) wide. The river’s basin is bounded on the north by the Volyn-Podilsk Upland and on the south of the river’s upper course by the Carpathian Mountains. Farther to the south are hilly plains and the Bessarabian Upland, and at the southeasternmost end of the basin is the Black Sea Lowland. The estuary of the Dniester is formed by the incursion of the sea into the lower Dniester River valley, forming a shallow basin that is separated from the sea by a narrow strip of land. The Dniester has many tributaries, only 15 of which are more than 60 miles (95 km) long. They include the Stryy, Zolota Lypa, Strypa, Seret, Zbruch, Smotrych, Ushytsya, Murafa, Râut, Bâc, and Botna.
