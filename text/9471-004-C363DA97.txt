Alessandro Scarlatti, in full Pietro Alessandro Gaspare Scarlatti   (born May 2, 1660, Palermo, Sicily, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies [now in Italy]—died  Oct. 22, 1725, Naples) Italian composer of operas and religious works.
Scarlatti was sent to Rome at about the age of 12; there he met Bernardo Pasquini, by whom he was greatly influenced. The first of his 115 operas, Gli equivoci nel sembiante (1679) won him the protection of Queen Christina of Sweden, for whom he wrote L’honestà negli amori (1680) and in whose service he remained until 1684. These works brought him commissions for operas from Naples, where in 1684 he became maestro di cappella in the royal service. He remained there until 1702, writing more than 40 operas and musical entertainments for the court and its circle. Gli equivoci in amore (1690) is a typical example of his work during that period.
