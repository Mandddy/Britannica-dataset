Louis Braille,  (born Jan. 4, 1809, Coupvray, near Paris, Fr.—died  Jan. 6, 1852, Paris) French educator who developed a system of printing and writing that is extensively used by the blind and that was named for him.
Braille was himself blinded at the age of three in an accident that occurred while he was playing with tools in his father’s harness shop. A tool slipped and plunged into his right eye. Sympathetic ophthalmia and total blindness followed. Nevertheless, he became a notable musician and excelled as an organist. Upon receiving a scholarship, he went in 1819 to Paris to attend the National Institute for Blind Children, and from 1826 he taught there.
