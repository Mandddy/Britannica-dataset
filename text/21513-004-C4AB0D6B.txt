Lillian Russell, original name Helen Louise Leonard  (born Dec. 4, 1861, Clinton, Iowa, U.S.—died June 6, 1922, Pittsburgh, Pa.) American singer and actress in light comedies who represented the feminine ideal of her generation. She was as famous for her flamboyant personal life as for her beauty and voice.
Helen Leonard attended convent and private schools in Chicago. About 1877 or 1878 she was taken by her mother to New York City, where her early training in voice and violin was supplemented by a year of opera study. Her first stage role was in the chorus of a Brooklyn company performing H.M.S. Pinafore in 1879. In November 1880 she made her New York City debut under the name Lillian Russell at Tony Pastor’s variety theatre.
