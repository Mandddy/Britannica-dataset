Jackson Haines,  (born 1840, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 1876, Finland) American skater known as the father of figure skating. A ballet dancer, he adapted ballet styles and techniques to a sport that had previously comprised a limited number of figures executed in a tight, awkward manner.
Having won the U.S. men’s figure-skating championship, he went to Europe in 1865. Although his skating style (called International) was rejected in the United States and England, he became a great popular success in Sweden, Austria, and elsewhere on the Continent. In Vienna, the world’s “waltz capital” in the 19th century, he astutely offered instruction in waltzing on ice. Skating schools founded or inspired by Haines sprang up in numerous countries. On a journey by sled from St. Petersburg to Stockholm, he contracted pneumonia and died.
