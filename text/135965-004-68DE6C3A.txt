Morgan Library and Museum, museum and library located in New York City that displays and collects artistic, literary, and musical works from ancient times to the present day.
American financier and industrial organizer John Pierpont Morgan, who was also a collector of art, books, and other historic documents, commissioned the Morgan Library, designed by architect Charles F. McKim as an Italian Renaissance-style palazzo, to house his collection. The library, built from 1902 to 1906, was originally founded as a private institution, but in 1924 Morganâ€™s son, J.P. Morgan, Jr., opened the collection to the public as a gift and memorial to his father (who had died 11 years earlier). The library was transformed into a public educational facility and research institution for the scholarly community. The institution has since focused on acquiring and preserving documents and small objects that represent some of the highest achievements in human culture.
