Cotyledon,  seed leaf within the embryo of a seed. Flowering plants whose embryos have a single cotyledon are grouped as monocots, or monocotyledonous plants; embryos with two cotyledons are grouped as dicots, or dicotyledonous plants. The number of cotyledons in the embryos of seeds of gymnosperms is highly variable, ranging from 8 to 20 or more.
