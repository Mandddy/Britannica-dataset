Thomas Dekker,  (born c. 1572, London, Eng.—died c. 1632) English dramatist and writer of prose pamphlets who is particularly known for his lively depictions of London life.
Few facts of Dekker’s life are certain. He may have been born into a family of Dutch immigrants living in London and is first mentioned as a playwright in 1598. He apparently wrote to support himself, and he had a hand in at least 42 plays written in the next 30 years. In the dispute known as “the poets’ war” or “the war of the theatres,” he was satirized in Ben Jonson’s Poetaster (produced 1601) as Demetrius Fannius, “a very simple honest fellow. . . a dresser of plays.” This precipitated Dekker’s own attack on Jonson in the play Satiro-mastix (produced 1601). Thirteen more plays survive in which Dekker collaborated with such figures as Thomas Middleton, John Webster, Philip Massinger, John Ford, and William Rowley.
