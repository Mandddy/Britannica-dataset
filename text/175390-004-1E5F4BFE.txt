Mary Poppins, American musical film, released in 1964, that features the now-iconic screen debut of Julie Andrews. A children’s classic, Mary Poppins is considered to be among the finest of Walt Disney’s productions. It was adapted from the P.L. Travers book of the same name.
The film concerns a magical London nanny (played by Andrews) who mysteriously appears at a troubled household to take charge of raising the two young children of a banker and a busy suffragette. Dick Van Dyke portrayed a musical chimney sweep who teaches the stern banker to appreciate the simple things in life.
