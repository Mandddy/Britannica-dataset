Artificial insemination, the introduction of semen into the vagina or cervix of a female by any method other than sexual intercourse. The procedure is widely used in animal breeding and is used in humans when a male is sterile or impotent or when a couple suffers from unexplained infertility (when the cause of infertility cannot be identified). Impregnation of a woman through artificial insemination may also be used by women or men in same-sex partnerships who wish to produce children of their own.
The first successful experiment with artificial insemination in animals was performed by Italian physiologist Lazzaro Spallanzani, who in 1780, while investigating animal reproduction, developed a technique for artificial insemination in dogs. This approach was refined in the 1930s in Russia, and the subsequent development of methods for the cryopreservation (preservation through freezing) of semen led to the widespread use of artificial insemination in animals.
