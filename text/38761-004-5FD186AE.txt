Saint Paschal I,  (born , Rome [Italy]—died  Feb. 11, 824, Rome; feast day May 14) pope from 817 to 824.
A priest who had served in the Curia, Paschal was an abbot when elected pope immediately after the death of his predecessor, Stephen IV (V), on Jan. 26, 817. During his pontificate Paschal was continually concerned with the relation of the papacy to the recently founded Frankish empire under Charlemagne’s son and successor, Louis I the Pious. Louis forcibly imposed on the church an unprecedented reform and reorganization of monasteries and dioceses while concurrently arranging the empire and trying to reconcile the safeguarding of Christian order and unity.
