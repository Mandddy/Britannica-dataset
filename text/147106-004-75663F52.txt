Dominique Strauss-Kahn, byname DSK  (born April 25, 1949, Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris, France) French economist and politician who served (2007–11) as the managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)—the United Nations agency that helps maintain a stable global system of currency exchange and promotes balanced economic growth.
Strauss-Kahn was raised in Agadir, southwestern Morocco, where his parents were employed. However, in 1960—following one of the most deadly and destructive earthquakes in Moroccan history—the family relocated to Monaco. Strauss-Kahn attended high school at the Lycée Carnot in Paris, earning top grades, and gained acceptance to the School of Higher Commercial Studies in Paris. There he received a degree in business (1971), to which he added a degree in political science from the Paris Institute of Political Studies (1972). He subsequently obtained a degree in public law as well as a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Paris.
