Henry Holland,  (born July 20, 1745—died  June 17, 1806, London, Eng.) English architect whose elegant, simple Neoclassicism contrasted with the more lavish Neoclassical style of his great contemporary Robert Adam.
Beginning as an assistant to his father, a successful builder, Holland later became the partner and son-in-law of the landscape architect Lancelot (“Capability”) Brown. Among his works in London were Brooks’s Club (1776–78). In 1783 the prince of Wales (the future George III) joined the club and subsequently hired Holland to remodel Carlton House (from 1783; demolished 1826), the prince’s town residence. The prince encouraged Holland’s interest in French architecture and decoration, and Holland began to use French craftsmen on his projects. Work for the prince led to further aristocratic commissions for Holland.
