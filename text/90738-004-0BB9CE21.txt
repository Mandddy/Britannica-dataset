Meet Me in St. Louis, American musical film, released in 1944, that provided Judy Garland with one of the best roles of her career, as well as several of her signature songs.
The film, set in St. Louis, Mo., follows the Smith family in the days leading up to the 1904 World’s Fair. The two eldest daughters grapple with life, love, and their dread of the family’s impending move to New York City. Meet Me in St. Louis contains a number of hit songs, from the upbeat “Trolley Song” to the beautiful but sombre “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”
