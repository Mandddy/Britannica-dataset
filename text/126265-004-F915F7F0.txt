Reamer,  rotary cutting tool of cylindrical or conical shape used for enlarging and finishing to accurate dimensions holes that have been drilled, bored, or cored. A reamer cannot be used to originate a hole. All reamers are provided with longitudinal flutes or grooves (eight are commonly used) that may be straight or helical; cutting may be done on the sides of the tool, using the sharpened edges of the apexes between the flutes, or cutting may take place on chamfered edges at the reamerâ€™s tip. The flutes permit passage of chips and allow cooling and lubricating fluid to reach the cutting edges. The two main classes of reamers are machine, or chucking, reamers and hand reamers. Machine reamers are used on machine tools such as drill presses, lathes, and screw machines. They have either straight or tapered shanks; hand reamers are slightly tapered to facilitate entry of the reamer and have a straight shank with a square end to fit a wrench. When it is necessary to enlarge reamed holes slightly, expansion reamers are available. These are split longitudinally, and their diameter can be adjusted by turning an end screw that expands internal cones. Reamers are made from high-carbon steel, high-speed steel, and cemented carbides.
