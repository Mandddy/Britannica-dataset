Römer, type of wineglass evolved in Germany, especially in the Rhineland, and the Netherlands over several centuries, reaching perfection in the 17th century. The shape of the Römer is a hemisphere superimposed on a cylinder, with a hollow foot built up by coiling threads of molten glass around a conical core. Applied to the characteristic cylindrical trunk (too thick to be called a stem) are pads of glass formed into shallow or pointed spots or raspberry-like knobs. Römers were distinct from the Berkemeyer glasses, which took the form of a funnel-shaped bowl on a cylinder; both have kinship with the German “cabbage stalk” glasses, which were entirely cylindrical and had knobs. Römers are usually coloured in tones of green; many are engraved, including a special class with calligraphic inscriptions, some of which are attributed to the Netherlandish artist Anne Roemers Visscher (c. 1583–1651).
An English goblet called rummer (from “Römer,” not “rum”) was first made similar to the German original but in the 18th century evolved into a very different form. Usually thick and heavy, the glasses have short stems, feet that are sometimes square, and bowls with a variety of shapes.
