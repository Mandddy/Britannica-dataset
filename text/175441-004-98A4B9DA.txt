Life with Father, American comedy film, released in 1947, that was based on Clarence Day, Jr.’s best-selling autobiography (1935) of the same name.
The film chronicles Day’s childhood growing up in Victorian-era New York under the ironclad rule of his stern but loving father (played by William Powell). Although Clarence Day, Sr., sees himself as master of the household, a number of episodes prove otherwise, notably when his wife, Vinnie (Irene Dunne), persuades him to be baptized.
