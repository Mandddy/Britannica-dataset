Distributed computing, the coordinated use of many computers disbursed over a wide area to do complex tasks.
Distributed computing is a method that researchers use to solve highly complicated problems without having to use an expensive supercomputer. Much like multiprocessing, which uses two or more processors in one computer to carry out a task, distributed computing uses a large number of computers to split up the computational load. With distributed computing, client programs are first installed onto each computer. The client programs then download files containing portions of the problem to be processed and analyzed. As each file is analyzed, the clients send the calculations to a centralized server that compiles the results. In many cases, the programs run when the computers would otherwise be idle, such as overnight.
