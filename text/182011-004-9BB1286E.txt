Rosario Ferré,  (born July 28, 1942, Ponce, Puerto Rico—died February 18, 2016, San Juan) short-story writer, novelist, critic, and professor, one of the leading women authors in contemporary Latin America. She wrote the bulk of her work in her native Spanish, but in 1995 she published a novel, House on the Lagoon, written in English.
Ferré, who was born into one of the richest families in Puerto Rico, studied at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts; Manhattanville College in Purchase, New York; and the University of Puerto Rico. Early in her career, her feminist writings made her controversial. During the 1970s, Ferré and other Puerto Rican intellectuals, writers, and critics produced an irreverent journal, Zona de carga y descarga (“Loading and Unloading Zone”), that became quite popular. It published texts by writers from other countries, such as the iconoclastic Cuban Severo Sarduy. Ferré also published criticism on Felisberto Hernández and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, among others.
