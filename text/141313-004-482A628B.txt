Porcupine fish,  any of the spiny, shallow-water fishes of the family Diodontidae, found in seas around the world, especially the species Diodon hystrix. They are related to the puffers and, like them, can inflate their bodies when provoked.
Porcupine fishes are short and broad-bodied, with large eyes, beaklike teeth, and skins set with spines, hence the name. These spines are short and permanently erect in some species, such as the burrfishes of the genus Chilomycterus. In the others, such as those of the genus Diodon, the spines lie against the body except when the fish is inflated. The skins of porcupine fishes, inflated, dried, and sometimes provided with a light bulb inside, are commonly sold as curios. The porcupine fish (Diodon hystrix) is a common and widely distributed member of the family. Found throughout the world, it is a dark-spotted, brownish fish reaching a maximum length of about 90 centimetres (3 feet).
