Chet Baker, in full Chesney Henry Baker  (born December 23, 1929, Yale, Oklahoma, U.S.—died May 13, 1988, Amsterdam, Netherlands) American jazz trumpeter and vocalist noted for the plaintive, fragile tone of both his playing and singing. He was a cult figure whose well-publicized struggles with drug addiction curtailed a promising career.
Born in Oklahoma and reared in California from age 10, Baker began playing trumpet in his school band. He played in U.S. Army bands during two stints as a soldier (1946–48 and 1950–52) and sat in with jazz groups in the San Francisco area during the early ’50s, often playing alongside Charlie Parker. He attracted considerable attention in 1952 as a member of Gerry Mulligan’s renowned pianoless quartet, with songs such as “Walkin’ Shoes,” “Bernie’s Tune,” and “My Funny Valentine” (one of Baker’s signature tunes) featuring Baker’s cool-toned, subdued playing. Baker at this time was heralded as a major new force in jazz, topping Metronome magazine’s poll as the top trumpeter of 1953 and establishing his own quartet in the same year. Several of Baker’s recordings from the 1950s also feature his work as a vocalist; his vibratoless, somewhat feminine-sounding tenor voice was in the “cool school” of singers such as Mel Tormé and June Christy. His 1954 recording of “Let’s Get Lost,” a romantic ballad that took on new connotations when sung by the addict Baker, became the song most associated with him.
