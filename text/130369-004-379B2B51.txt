Lewis Morris Rutherfurd,  (born Nov. 25, 1816, Morrisania, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 30, 1892, Tranquility, N.J.) American astrophysicist who made the first telescopes designed for celestial photography.
Although trained as a scientist during his studies at Williams College (Williamstown, Mass.), Rutherfurd later became a lawyer. He gave up his practice in 1849 and traveled to Europe because of his wife’s health. He had maintained an interest in science and in Europe met the Italian astronomer Giovanni Amici, who was working on achromatism in microscopes. In 1856 he set up a small observatory at his home in New York City and obtained his first photographs of the Moon two years later. Not satisfied with taking pictures through a regular telescope, he devised a lens system that converted it into a photographic telescope (essentially a camera using a telescope as a lens). He successfully tested his invention in 1860, photographing a solar eclipse from Labrador.
