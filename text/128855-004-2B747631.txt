Ceratopsian, also called ceratopian ,  any of a group of plant-eating dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Period (146 million to 66 million years ago) characterized by a bony frill on the back of the skull and a unique upper beak bone, called a rostral.
The ceratopsians comprise three lineages (see images). Members of the Psittacosauridae, including Psittacosaurus, were mostly bipedal and lived during the Early Cretaceous; they had a beak, a small frill, and no horns. Members of the Protoceratopsidae, including Protoceratops and Leptoceratops, were mostly quadrupedal and slightly larger and lived from the Early to Late Cretaceous; these dinosaurs had a somewhat larger frill but no horns.
