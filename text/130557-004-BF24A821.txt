Bahia, estado (state) of eastern Brazil. It is bounded by Piauí and Pernambuco states to the north, by Alagoas and Sergipe states to the northeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, by Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais states to the south, and by Goiás and Tocantins states to the west. The capital, Salvador, is a port situated at the southern tip of the peninsula that separates Todos os Santos (All Saints) Bay, a deep natural harbour, from the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese first entered the region in 1501, through the bay where Salvador is now located, and they called the area Bahia (“Bay”), whence the state derives its name. Area 218,029 square miles (564,693 square km). Pop. (2010) 14,016,906.
The Diamantina Upland and its northern extension, the Tombador Mountains, run north across Bahia from the borders of Minas Gerais and constitute the line of greatest elevation. The Diamantina reaches its maximum elevation at Almas Peak (6,070 feet [1,850 metres]). From the east and west of this dorsal ridge descend plateaus that vary in elevation between about 650 and 2,600 feet (200 and 800 metres) and are characterized by inselbergs (steep-sided, isolated hills that have been left by erosion). The eastern edge of the highlands terminates in the hills overlooking the coastal plain.
