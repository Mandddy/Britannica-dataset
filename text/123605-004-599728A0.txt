Frederic Remington, in full Frederic Sackrider Remington  (born October 4, 1861, Canton, New York, U.S.—died December 26, 1909, near Ridgefield, Connecticut) American painter, illustrator, and sculptor noted for his realistic portrayals of life in the American West.
Remington studied art at Yale University (1878–80) and briefly (1886) at the Art Students League of New York. Thereafter he devoted himself primarily to illustrative work. In the years between his schooling, he traveled widely, spending much time west of the Mississippi River, and he made a specialty of depicting Native Americans, cowboys, soldiers, horses, and other aspects of life on the plains. On those trips he sketched and photographed continuously, amassing material to take back to and work from in his studio in New York City.
