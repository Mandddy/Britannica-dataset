Battle of Long Island, (August 27, 1776), in the American Revolution, successful British action in Brooklyn, New York, against the American Continental Army. The battle initiated the British campaign of 1776 to seize control of New York and thereby isolate New England from the rest of the colonies. After the British evacuation from Boston in March, the British general Lord Howe moved to occupy New York City under the protection of a British fleet that commanded the surrounding waters. To protect his left flank, the defending American general, George Washington, stationed one-third of his troops (numbering no more than 20,000 trained soldiers) on the Long Island side of the East River, where they erected fortifications.
From his encampment on Staten Island, Howe attacked Washington’s isolated wing by landing 20,000 men at Gravesend Bay, Long Island, on August 22. After four days’ reconnaissance, Howe drove the Americans back and inflicted heavy losses (1,200 American prisoners were taken, and about 400 men on each side were killed or wounded). Howe might have captured Washington’s entire force on Long Island at this point, but instead he elected to lay siege. The following week Washington took advantage of this delay to retreat across the river to Manhattan, a successful move that helped repair low American morale.
