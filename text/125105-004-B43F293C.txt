Claros, site of an oracular shrine of the Greek god Apollo, near Colophon in Ionia, Asia Minor (now in Turkey). According to a tradition preserved by the Greek mythographer Apollodorus, the shrine was founded by Manto, daughter of Tiresias, a blind Theban seer. Prior to their utterances, the prophets drank from a pool within a cave. Inscriptions concerning the Clarian oracle, which was especially celebrated during Roman times, have been found as far away as Britain.
