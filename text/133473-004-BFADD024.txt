Stela, also spelled stele (Greek: “shaft” or “pillar”), plural stelae,  standing stone slab used in the ancient world primarily as a grave marker but also for dedication, commemoration, and demarcation. Although the origin of the stela is unknown, a stone slab, either decorated or undecorated, was commonly used as a tombstone, both in the East and in Grecian lands as early as Mycenae and the Geometric Period (c. 900–c. 700 bce). Dedicatory stelae can be traced through the Late Bronze Age Canaanite religion from miniature stelae at Hagar to immense numbers of stelae found in Carthaginian temples and sanctuaries. When Akhenaton, the heretical pharaoh of Egypt, founded his new capital, he had stelae carved in the cliffs at the edge of the desert to indicate the city limits.
The largest number of stelae were produced in Attica, where they were usually used as grave markers. These were tall and narrow rectangular shafts carved in relief, topped by a cavetto capital (a concave molding) and a sphinx, and usually having a rectangular base. About 530 bce a simpler form of gravestone was adopted, with a somewhat shorter shaft surmounted only by a palmette finial; a single figure was incised into the stone, which was then painted. By the 5th century the shaft was low and wide, with a more crowded composition of perhaps several figures carved in almost three-dimensional relief.
