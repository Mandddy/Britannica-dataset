Mid-latitude steppe and desert climate, major climate type of the Köppen classification characterized by extremely variable temperature conditions, with annual means decreasing and annual ranges increasing poleward, and relatively little precipitation. This climate is typically located deep within the interiors of continents and is contiguous with the tropical desert climates of North and South America and of central Asia. This climate type is divided into two subtypes in the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system. The mid-latitude steppe (BSk) subtype is slightly wetter than the mid-latitude desert (part of BWk) subtype.
Both subtypes owe their origins to locations deep within continental interiors, far from the windward coasts and sources of moist, maritime air. Remoteness from sources of water vapour is enhanced in some regions (such as the Great Plains of the United States) by mountain barriers upwind. Cool true deserts (regions classified into the BWk subtype) extend to 50° latitude and cool steppes (regions classified into the BSk subtype) reach nearly 60° N in the Canadian Prairies, well beyond the limits of the subtropical anticyclone. In the higher latitudes, winters are severely cold, with meager precipitation (much of it in the form of snow) associated with polar and arctic air masses. Summer precipitation is more often convective, arriving in the form of scattered thunderstorm activity brought about by irregular incursions of moist air. The steppe subtype tends to be located peripheral to the true desert, either adjacent to the moister C and D climates or at the poleward extent of the range, where reduced evaporation under cooler conditions makes more of the scarce precipitation available as soil moisture for plant growth.
