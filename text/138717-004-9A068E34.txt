Monopoly and competition, basic factors in the structure of economic markets. In economics monopoly and competition signify certain complex relations among firms in an industry. A monopoly implies an exclusive possession of a market by a supplier of a product or a service for which there is no substitute. In this situation the supplier is able to determine the price of the product without fear of competition from other sources or through substitute products. It is generally assumed that a monopolist will choose a price that maximizes profits.
Competition is directly influenced by the means through which companies produce and distribute their products. Different industries have different market structuresâ€”that is, different market characteristics that determine the relations of sellers to one another, of sellers to buyers, and so forth. Aspects of market structure that underlie the competitive landscape are: (1) the degree of concentration of sellers in an industry, (2) the degree of product differentiation, and (3) the ease or difficulty with which new sellers can enter the industry.
