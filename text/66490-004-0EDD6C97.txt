Walker Percy,  (born May 28, 1916, Birmingham, Alabama, U.S.—died May 10, 1990, Covington, Louisiana) American novelist who wrote of the New South transformed by industry and technology.
Orphaned in late childhood after his father, a lawyer, committed suicide and his mother died in an automobile accident, Percy went with his brothers to live with their father’s cousin, a bachelor and lawyer, in Greenville, Mississippi. Percy studied at the University of North Carolina (B.A., 1937) and Columbia University (M.D., 1941) and, while working as a pathologist at Bellevue Hospital, New York City, contracted tuberculosis, compelling him to rest at an upstate New York sanatorium. While recovering he read widely, was attracted to the works of European existentialists, and decided on a career in writing. He also converted to Roman Catholicism.
