Wasatch-Cache National Forest, popular recreational region of forests and streams in the Stansbury, Monte Cristo, Bear River, Wasatch, and Uinta mountain ranges of northern Utah and southwestern Wyoming, U.S. It adjoins Ashley and Uinta national forests in Utah and Caribou National Forest in Idaho and lies primarily east of the Great Salt Lake. Established in 1906, its boundaries enclose some 3,160 square miles (8,185 square km) in three divisions; of this area, about 2,070 square miles (5,360 square km) is federal land. It contains a portion of the High Uintas Wilderness Area, which extends into Ashley National Forest to the south, and several other wilderness areas. The majority of the forest is within Utah; less than 60 square miles (155 square km) lies in Wyoming. Headquarters are at Salt Lake City.
The name Wasatch is derived from a Ute Indian word meaning “high mountain pass”; the term cache refers to the early fur trappers’ practice of storing their furs before trading them. The national forest provides water, timber, rangeland, oil and gas, and wilderness in addition to recreation. There are a number of ski resorts in the forest, some of which were venues during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Other popular activities include trout fishing, deer and elk hunting, rock climbing, mountain biking, hiking, and snowmobiling.
