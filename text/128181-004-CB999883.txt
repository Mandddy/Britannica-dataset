Blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi), one of the gaudiest of the antelopes, a South African version of the closely related sassaby. The blesbok ranged the treeless Highveld in countless thousands throughout the mid-19th century but was hunted nearly to extinction. It has been reintroduced, mainly on private farms, throughout and beyond its former range and is again one of the most abundant antelopes in South Africa. An isolated related subspecies, the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus dorcas), confined to the coastal plain of Western Cape province, came nearer to extinction and is still uncommon; the largest population, of 200–250, lives in Bontebok National Park.
The smallest member of the hartebeest tribe, the blesbok is only 85–100 cm (33–39 inches) tall and weighs 55–80 kg (120–175 pounds). The male has S-shaped horns that are 35–50 cm (14–20 inches) long; the female’s horns are somewhat shorter and thinner. The blesbok’s coat is a glossy, dark reddish brown, which contrasts with the white of its belly, lower legs, and facial blaze. The bontebok is even more colourful and glossier, with purple-black blotches on upper limbs and flanks, a white rump patch and upper tail, and a facial blaze bisected by a brown band. Newborn calves of both subspecies are light tan with dark facial blazes.
