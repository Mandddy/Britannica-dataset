Botox, also called botulinum toxin type A,  trade name of a drug based on the toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum that causes severe food poisoning (botulism). When locally injected in small amounts, Botox blocks the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, interfering with a muscleâ€™s ability to contract. It is used to treat severe muscle spasms or severe, uncontrollable sweating. Botox can also be used for cosmetic purposes to treat facial wrinkles. Results appear about three to seven days after injection and, depending on the condition that the injections are intended to treat, may last anywhere from two months to more than six months.
