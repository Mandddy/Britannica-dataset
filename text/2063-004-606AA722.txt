Latitude and longitude, coordinate system by means of which the position or location of any place on Earth’s surface can be determined and described.
Latitude is a measurement on a globe or map of location north or south of the Equator. Technically, there are different kinds of latitude—geocentric, astronomical, and geographic (or geodetic)—but there are only minor differences between them. In most common references, geocentric latitude is implied. Given in degrees, minutes, and seconds, geocentric latitude is the arc subtended by an angle at Earth’s centre and measured in a north-south plane poleward from the Equator. Thus, a point at 30°15′20″ N subtends an angle of 30°15′20″at the centre of the globe; similarly, the arc between the Equator and either geographic pole is 90° (one-fourth the circumference of the Earth, or 1/4 × 360°), and thus the greatest possible latitudes are 90° N and 90° S. As aids to indicate different latitudinal positions on maps or globes, equidistant circles are plotted and drawn parallel to the Equator and each other; they are known as parallels, or parallels of latitude.
