Troy Aikman, in full Troy Kenneth Aikman  (born November 21, 1966, West Covina, California, U.S.) American gridiron football quarterback who led the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) to three Super Bowl victories (1993, 1994, and 1996).
Aikman was raised in Cerritos, a suburb of Los Angeles, before moving with his family to the small town of Henryetta, Oklahoma, where he was an all-state high school standout. He was recruited by coaches Barry Switzer of the University of Oklahoma and Jimmy Johnson of Oklahoma State University; both later went on to coach him as a professional with the Cowboys. Aikman chose the University of Oklahoma, but he left the school after Switzer introduced the wishbone formation to the Oklahoma offense, emphasizing a running game at the expense of Aikman’s strong passing skills. Aikman subsequently attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where, as a transfer student, he had to sit out the 1986 season. He excelled in his remaining two years at UCLA, leading his squad to a 20–4 record, with postseason victories in the Aloha Bowl (December 1987) and the Cotton Bowl (January 1989). He was named All-American in his senior year and placed third in the polling for the Heisman Trophy, college football’s most prestigious award.
