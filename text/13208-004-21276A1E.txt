Ballet position, any of the five positions of the feet fundamental to all classical ballet. The term may also denote the various poses of the body. First used by Thoinot Arbeau in 1588, codified by Pierre Beauchamp circa 1680, and set down by Pierre Rameau in Le Maître à danser (1725; The Dancing Master, 1931), the positions are the starting and ending points for the intricate ballet movements.
In all positions each leg is turned sideways from the hip, so that the toes extend out to each side and the feet form straight or parallel lines on the floor. Body weight is evenly distributed over both feet, which can either remain flat on the floor, rest on the balls of the feet (demi-pointe), or rest on the toes (pointe; women only). Corresponding positions of the arms and hands (port de bras) complete the perfect balance of the figure.
