Biodiversity, also called biological diversity,  the variety of life found in a place on Earth or, often, the total variety of life on Earth. A common measure of this variety, called species richness, is the count of species in an area. Colombia and Kenya, for example, each have more than 1,000 breeding species of birds, whereas the forests of Great Britain and of eastern North America are home to fewer than 200. A coral reef off northern Australia may have 500 species of fish, while the rocky shoreline of Japan may be home to only 100 species. Such numbers capture some of the differences between places—the tropics, for example, have more biodiversity than temperate regions—but raw species count is not the only measure of diversity. Furthermore, biodiversity encompasses the genetic variety within each species and the variety of ecosystems that species create.
Although examining counts of species is perhaps the most common method used to compare the biodiversity of various places, in practice biodiversity is weighted differently for different species, the reason being that some species are deemed more valuable or more interesting than others. One way this “value” or “interest” is assessed is by examining the diversity that exists above the species level, in the genera, families, orders, classes, and phyla to which species belong (see taxonomy). For example, the count of animal species that live on land is much higher than the count of those that live in the oceans because there are huge numbers of terrestrial insect species; insects comprise many orders and families, and they constitute the largest class of arthropods, which themselves constitute the largest animal phylum. In contrast, there are fewer animal phyla in terrestrial environments than in the oceans. No animal phylum is restricted to the land, but brachiopods (see lamp shell), pogonophorans (see beardworm), and other animal phyla occur exclusively or predominantly in marine habitats.
