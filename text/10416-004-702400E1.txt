Kokako, also called Wattled Crow,   (species Callaeas cinerea), New Zealand songbird of the family Callaeidae (order Passeriformes). The kokako is 45 cm (17.5 inches) long and has a gray body, black mask, and blue or orange wattles at the corners of the mouth. Surviving in a few mountain forests, the kokako lives mainly on fruits and has a mellow, deliberate song; “organbird” and “bellbird” are local names.
