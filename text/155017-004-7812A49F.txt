QR Code, in full Quick Response Code,  a type of bar code that consists of a printed square pattern of small black and white squares that encode data which can be scanned into a computer system. The black and white squares can represent numbers from 0 to 9, letters from A to Z, or characters in non-Latin scripts such as Japanese kanji.
QR Codes were developed in 1994 by the Japanese corporation Denso Wave—a division of Denso, which is a subsidiary of the automobile company Toyota Motor Corporation—to track automobile parts during the assembly process. QR Codes are often used in advertising to encode the URL of a Web site that contains a coupon or information about a product. They also have been used on tickets at sporting events and concerts. QR Codes are usually read with laser scanners or cameras on mobile telephones, which then use special software to decode the pattern.
