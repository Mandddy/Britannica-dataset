Jakob Steiner,  (born March 18, 1796, Utzenstorf, Switzerland—died April 1, 1863, Bern) Swiss mathematician who was one of the founders of modern synthetic and projective geometry.
As the son of a small farmer, Steiner had no early schooling and did not learn to write until he was 14. Against the wishes of his parents, at 18 he entered the Pestalozzi School at Yverdon, Switzerland, where his extraordinary geometric intuition was discovered. Later he went to the University of Heidelberg and the University of Berlin to study, supporting himself precariously as a tutor. By 1824 he had studied the geometric transformations that led him to the theory of inversive geometry, but he did not publish this work. The founding in 1826 of the first regular publication devoted to mathematics, Crelle’s Journal, gave Steiner an opportunity to publish some of his other original geometric discoveries. In 1832 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Königsberg, and two years later he occupied the chair of geometry established for him at Berlin, a post he held until his death.
