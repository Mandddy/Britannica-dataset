Rust,  disease of thousands of economically important plants, as well as weeds, caused by more than 4,000 species of fungi.
During their life cycle rust fungi parasitize either one species of plant (autoecious, or monoecious, rust) or two distinct species (heteroecious rust). One heteroecious rust with five spore forms during its life cycle is black stem rust (Puccinia graminis) of wheat and other cereals and grasses. Other heteroecious rusts include those that use junipers (red cedar) as one host and apple, Japanese quince, hawthorn, rose, and related plants as the other; white pine rust (Cronartium ribicola), with five-needled pines as one host and currant and gooseberry (Ribes) species as the other; and a rust with Douglas fir as one host and poplars as the other. Autoecious rusts include those that attack asparagus, bean, chrysanthemum, coffee, hollyhock, snapdragon, and sugarcane.
