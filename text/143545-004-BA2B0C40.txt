Leopard cat,  (Felis bengalensis), forest-dwelling cat, family Felidae, found in India and Southeast Asia and noted for its leopard-like colouring. The coat of the leopard cat is usually yellowish or reddish brown above, white below, and heavily marked with dark spots and streaks. Length of the animal ranges from 45 to 75 centimetres (18 to 30 inches) excluding the 23â€“35-cm tail. The leopard cat is a nocturnal hunter, preying on birds and small mammals (including domestic fowl in some areas). It breeds in spring (possibly again later in the year in Malaysia); litters consist of two to four young, and the gestation period is about 56 days.
