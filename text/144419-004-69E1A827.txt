Eddie Collins, in full Edward Trowbridge Collins, Sr., also called Cocky  (born May 2, 1887, Millerton, N.Y., U.S.—died March 25, 1951, Boston, Mass.) American professional baseball player who was one of the most proficient hitters and base stealers in the sport’s history.
Collins was raised in affluent circumstances in the suburbs outside New York City. He attended Columbia University, where he was the quarterback of the football team as well as the shortstop of the baseball team. While still in college, he began playing semiprofessional baseball under an assumed name. When his side job was uncovered by Columbia, he forfeited his senior year of eligibility. His moonlighting paid dividends, however, when a vacationing Philadelphia Athletics player saw Collins play and raved about him to Athletics manager Connie Mack. Mack signed Collins to a contract, and the young infielder played abbreviated seasons with the Athletics in 1906 and 1907 before joining the team full-time in 1908 after graduating from Columbia.
