Magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), also called pied goose or semipalmated goose,  large unusual waterfowl of Australia and Papua New Guinea. Although classified by many ornithologists as the sole member of the subfamily Anseranatinae in family Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans), it may merit recognition as a separate family in order Anseriformes on account of its primitive characteristics. The magpie goose typically weighs 3 kg (6.5 pounds) and is 75–90 cm (30–35 inches) long. The sexes are alike in having a black-and-white body (hence “magpie”), long neck and legs, and virtually unwebbed toes; the long hooked bill and bare face give the bird a vulturish look. The male has a pronounced dome atop the head.
This species differs from other waterfowl in several ways. The unwebbed toes are unusually long, allowing it to perch high in small branches. Its legs are also unusually long, making it the only waterfowl whose legs extend beyond the tail during flight, and it is the only waterfowl whose breeding groups consist of one male and two females. It molts its flight feathers gradually and thereby has no flightless period.
