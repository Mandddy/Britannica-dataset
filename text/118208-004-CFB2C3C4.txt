Stewartia, any member of a genus (Stewartia) of at least nine species of shrubs and small trees, in the tea family (Theaceae), native to East Asia and eastern North America. They are planted as ornamentals in warm areas for their showy camellia-like flowers and their strikingly coloured, peeling bark.
Especially attractive is the Japanese stewartia (S. pseudocamellia), a tree that grows to a height of 15 metres (50 feet) and has reddish, peeling bark and large white flowers with conspicuous orange stamens in the centre. Silky camellia, or Virginia stewartia (S. malacodendron), a shrub up to 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) high, has white flowers with purple stamens. Another American species is the mountain stewartia, sometimes called mountain camellia (S. ovata), which is also shrubby; it is mostly confined to the southern Appalachians.
