Stephen Daldry, in full Stephen David Daldry  (born May 2, 1961, Dorset, England) English film and theatre director known for his sensitive and nuanced treatments of stories featuring conflicted characters.
Daldry’s father—a bank manager who died when Daldry was 15—discouraged his early interest in theatre. Abetted by his cabaret singer mother, however, Daldry joined a theatre troupe in Taunton and by age 15 had resolved to direct. He attended the University of Sheffield on a Royal Air Force scholarship, earning a bachelor’s degree (1982) in English literature. At Sheffield he directed the university theatre company and cultivated his radical bona fides with forays into socialism and a penchant for wearing pillbox hats.
