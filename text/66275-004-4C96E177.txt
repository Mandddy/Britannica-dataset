Rómulo Gallegos, in full Rómulo Gallegos Freire  (born August 21, 1884, Caracas, Venezuela—died April 4, 1969, Caracas) president of Venezuela (in 1948) and novelist, best known for his forceful novels that dramatize the overpowering natural aspects of the Venezuelan Llanos (grasslands), the local folklore, and such social events as alligator hunts.
Gallegos won an international reputation as one of the leading novelists in Latin American literature with Doña Bárbara (1929; Eng. trans. Doña Barbara), the story of the ruthless female boss of a hacienda who meets her match in the city-educated Santos Luzardo. She and the violent frontier yield in the face of civilization and law. The novel Cantaclaro (1934; “Chanticleer”) deals with a ballad singer of the Llanos, while Canaima (1935; Eng. trans. Canaima) is a story of the tropical forest, named after the evil spirit that pervades the jungle.
