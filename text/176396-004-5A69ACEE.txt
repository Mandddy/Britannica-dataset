Planet of the Apes, American science-fiction film, released in 1968, that blended action and social commentary to become a classic of that genre, inspiring four sequels and two television series.
Based on the novel of the same name by Pierre Boulle, the film centres on a group of astronauts—led by George Taylor (played by Charlton Heston)—who crash-land on a strange, seemingly distant planet ruled by civilized apes. Captured and caged, Taylor eventually persuades the chimpanzee scientists Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) to help him escape. The shocking ending—in which the remains of the Statue of Liberty are found, revealing that the supposedly unknown planet is really Earth—ranks among the most famous in film history.
