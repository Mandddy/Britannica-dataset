Tectosilicate, formerly called Polysilicate,  any member of a group of compounds with structures that have silicate tetrahedrons (a central silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron) arranged in a three-dimensional lattice. Each of the four oxygen atoms of a given tetrahedron is shared with another tetrahedron. Each tetrahedron, therefore, is linked to four others. Tectosilicates, including quartz and other silica minerals, have chemical formulas that contain some multiple of SiO2.
