Reed, in botany, any of several species of large aquatic grasses, especially the four species constituting the genus Phragmites of the grass family (Poaceae). The common, or water, reed (Phragmites australis) occurs along the margins of lakes, fens, marshes, and streams from the Arctic to the tropics. It is a broad-leafed grass, about 1.5 to 5 metres (5 to 16.5 feet) tall, with feathery flower clusters and stiff, smooth stems. Other plants of the family Poaceae known as reeds are giant reed (Arundo donax), sea reed (Ammophila arenaria), reed canary grass (Phalaris), and reedgrass, or bluejoint (Calamagrostis). Bur reed (Sparganium) and reed mace (Typha) are plants of other families.
Dried reed stems have been used for millennia as thatching and construction material, in basketry, for arrows and pens, and in musical instruments (see reed instruments). They also are harvested for their cellulose content.
