Motagua River, Spanish Río Motagua,  river in eastern Guatemala, rising in the central highlands near Chichicastenango. The Motagua is Guatemala’s longest river, measuring approximately 250 miles (400 km). Flowing generally eastward and northeastward, it empties into Omoa Bay off the Gulf of Honduras at the Honduran border. Near its source it is referred to locally as the Silbapec River and further downstream as the Río Grande. The Chuacús, Minas, and San Isidro mountain ranges rise from the left bank of the Motagua; the major tributaries, including the Chiquimula, flow from the south. Navigable by shallow-draft boats for approximately 125 miles (200 km) upstream from its mouth, the Motagua is a major transportation artery for the bananas, coffee, and other fruits raised in the valleys of the eastern portion. The United Fruit Company began extensive banana operations in the river valley in 1904. There is some placer gold mining along its course. The Puerto Barrios–Guatemala City railroad and Atlantic Highway follow the river valley upstream as far as El Progreso.
