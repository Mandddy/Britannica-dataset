Virgin Islands National Park, conservation area covering some three-fifths of the island of St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, West Indies. The park was established in 1956 and now also includes waters surrounding St. John (added in 1962) and most of Hassel Island (1978) in the harbour of Charlotte Amalie (on the island of St. Thomas). It covers a total area of 23 square miles (60 square km) of land and water. The park was designated a UNESCO World Network Biosphere Reserve in 1983.
The original inhabitants, the agricultural Arawak Indians, left rock carvings. The Arawak were killed or pushed out by Caribs before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1493. Danish sugar plantations were established in the late 17th century, and permanent settlement began in the early 18th century. The abolition of slavery on the island in 1848 was a primary reason for the decline of sugar cultivation, which had ended by the time the United States purchased the Virgin Islands in 1917; the population dwindled and turned to subsistence farming.
