Amedeo Modigliani,  (born July 12, 1884, Livorno, Italy—died January 24, 1920, Paris, France) Italian painter and sculptor whose portraits and nudes—characterized by asymmetrical compositions, elongated figures, and a simple but monumental use of line—are among the most-important portraits of the 20th century.
Modigliani was born into a Jewish family of merchants. As a child, he suffered from pleurisy and typhus, which prevented him from receiving a conventional education. In 1898 he began to study painting. After a brief stay in Florence in 1902, he continued his artistic studies in Venice, remaining there until the winter of 1906, when he left for Paris. His early admiration for Italian Renaissance painting—especially that of Siena—was to last throughout his life.
