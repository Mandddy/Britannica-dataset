Beatitude,  any of the blessings said by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount as told in the biblical New Testament in Matthew 5:3–12 and in the Sermon on the Plain in Luke 6:20–23. Named from the initial words (beati sunt, “blessed are”) of those sayings in the Latin Vulgate Bible, the Beatitudes describe the blessedness of those who have certain qualities or experiences peculiar to those belonging to the Kingdom of Heaven.
The four blessings in the Sermon on the Plain may have been the nucleus of the expanded nine in the Sermon on the Mount. In addition to these two compilations, other Beatitudes are found in other places in the New Testament (e.g., Matthew 11:6, Luke 7:23, and John 20:29).
