Rashōmon, (
        Japanese: “The Rashō Gate”) short story by Akutagawa Ryūnosuke, published in Japanese in 1915 in a university literary magazine.
The story, set in 12th-century Kyōto, reveals in spare and elegant language the thoughts of a man on the edge of a life of crime and the incident that pushes him over the brink. Combined with Akutagawa’s later story “Yabu no naka” (1921; “In a Grove”), “Rashōmon” was the starting point for Japanese director Kurosawa Akira’s classic film Rashōmon (1950).
