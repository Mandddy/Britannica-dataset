Halifax explosion of 1917, devastating explosion on December 6, 1917, that occurred when a munitions ship blew up in Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada. Nearly 2,000 people died and some 9,000 were injured in the disaster, which flattened more than 1 square mile (2.5 square km) of the city of Halifax.
Shortly before 9:00 am the Imo, a Norwegian steamship carrying supplies for the Belgian Relief Commission (a World War I-era relief organization), headed out of Halifax Harbour and found itself on a collision course with the French steamship Mont-Blanc. Unbeknownst to others in the harbour, the Mont-Blanc was carrying explosives destined for the French war effort. After exchanging warning signals, both vessels initiated evasion maneuvers but ultimately collided. The French ship caught fire and drifted into a pier. As crowds gathered, emergency personnel tried to control the damage, but just after 9:04 am the Mont-Blanc exploded. The blast and the resulting tsunami, which surged approximately 60 feet (18 metres) above the high-water mark, destroyed more than 1,600 buildings and scattered debris for several miles. In the aftermath of the explosion, hospitals were inundated with the wounded, and morgues struggled to identify and document the dead. News of the disaster spread quickly, and aid soon arrived from within Canada as well as from the United States.
