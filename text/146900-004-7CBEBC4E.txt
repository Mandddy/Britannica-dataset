Hapkido, (
        Korean: “way of coordinated energy”) a Korean form of unarmed self-defense based on the circular foot sweeps and kicks of traditional Korean tae kyon but incorporating punches and circular throws and a yielding principle similar to that of aikido. The emphasis on circular motion allows for a free-flowing form of combat in which one technique can merge with the next and the direction of force can easily be changed by changing the axis of rotation. See also martial art.
