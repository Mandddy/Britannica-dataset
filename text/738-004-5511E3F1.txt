Château Gaillard, (French: “Saucy Castle”), 12th-century castle built by Richard the Lion-Heart on the Andelys cliff overlooking the Seine River in France; substantial portions of it still stand. Upon its completion Richard reportedly declared in triumph that his new castle was gaillard, a term that has been defined in numerous ways, most often as “saucy” but also as “cheeky,” “gallant,” “impudent,” “strapping,” and “defiant.” All that is to say: it was the strongest castle of its age, built as a challenge to the French monarchy.
Château Gaillard guarded the Seine River valley approach to Normandy. Skillfully designed and executed, with the base of the keep carved out of the natural rock, and with all approaches fronted with suitable towers and walls, it included an independent strongpoint (the châtelet) protecting the eastern end of the height, with the main keep occupying the rest of the site.
