He was musical director of the Montreal Symphony from 1961 to 1967, and he served in the same position for the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962 to 1978, making him the first conductor to direct two major North American orchestras simultaneously. In 1964 Mehta made his debut as an opera conductor with Giacomo Puccini’s Tosca in Montreal. The next year he conducted Giuseppe Verdi’s Aida at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, and soon he was engaged to conduct opera in Vienna, London, Milan, and many other cities. In 1968 he became chief music adviser to the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and in 1981 that orchestra named him music director for life.
