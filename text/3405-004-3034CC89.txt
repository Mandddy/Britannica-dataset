Walter Payton, in full Walter Jerry Payton, byname Sweetness  (born July 25, 1954, Columbia, Miss., U.S.—died Nov. 1, 1999, Barrington, Ill.) American professional gridiron football player whose productivity and durability made him one of the game’s greatest running backs. He retired in 1987 as the leading rusher in the history of the National Football League (NFL), a title he held until 2002, when he was surpassed by Emmitt Smith.
Payton played football in high school and at Jackson State University in Mississippi. It was during his college years that he gained the sobriquet “Sweetness” for his affable personality and graceful athleticism. In addition to his role as starting running back, he was also an occasional kicker at Jackson State, and his four-year total of 464 points was a National Collegiate Athletic Association record. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears with the fourth overall selection of the 1975 NFL draft. Payton was named to the first of nine career Pro Bowls in his second season, and in 1977 he won the league’s Most Valuable Player award after leading the NFL in rushing yards (1,852; a franchise record) and rushing touchdowns (14). In the 1985 season he helped the Bears post a 15–1 record and win the franchise’s first Super Bowl title the following January. He retired after the 1987 season.
