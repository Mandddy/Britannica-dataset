Skittles, game of bowling at pins, played primarily in Great Britain. Skittles was played for centuries in public houses or clubs, mostly in western England and the Midlands, southern Wales, and southeastern Scotland. The rules and methods of scoring varied from place to place, but the basic principle of bowling a wooden or rubber ball (weighing about 10 pounds [4.5 kilograms]) at nine large oval-headed pins, set in diamond formation 21 feet (about 6.5 metres) away, remained the same. The player who knocked down all the pins (scored as “chalks”) in the fewest throws was the winner. In the London area, however, the bowlers used a flat, round, loaf-shaped “cheese” made of lignum vitae wood and weighing from 12 to 14 pounds (5.4 to 6.4 kg). Control of this older form of the game was assumed by the Amateur Skittle Association, which specified the dimensions of the alley and the distance between each of the nine pins in the diamond frame.
