Emu-wren,  any of the three species of the Australian genus Stipiturus, of the songbird family Maluridae. In these tiny birds the narrow, cocked tail consists of six wispy feathersâ€”in quality, like the feathers of the emu. The most widespread species, the southern emu-wren (S. malachurus), is streaked brown, with pale-blue throat in the male. Emu-wrens are shy inhabitants of wet and dry scrublands.
