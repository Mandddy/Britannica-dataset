Barney Frank, original name Barnett Frank  (born March 31, 1940, Bayonne, New Jersey, U.S.) American Democratic politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1981–2013) and was one of the first openly gay members of Congress.
Born Barnett Frank—he legally changed his name to Barney in the 1960s—he was raised in a Jewish working-class family in New Jersey. He excelled at writing and debate in high school, and he attended Harvard University, earning a B.A. in 1962. He remained at Harvard for another six years, teaching undergraduate classes in government and working toward a Ph.D. Frank was a popular and provocative instructor, and students were drawn to the quick wit that was concealed beneath his relaxed, sometimes rumpled, appearance. He left prior to completing that degree to work as chief of staff for Boston Mayor Kevin White. He resigned from the White administration in 1970 with the intention of returning to Harvard, but he was soon hired as an assistant to U.S. Rep. Michael Harrington, a Democrat representing the Massachusetts Sixth District.
