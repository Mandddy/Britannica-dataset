Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell, in full Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell (of Eritrea and of Winchester), Viscount Wavell of Cyrenaica and of Winchester, Viscount Keren of Eritrea and of Winchester  (born May 5, 1883, Colchester, Essex, England—died May 24, 1950, London) British field marshal and government administrator whose victories against the Italians in North Africa during the early part of World War II were offset by his inability to defeat the German Afrika Korps under General Erwin Rommel (1941) and his failure to stop the Japanese in Malaya (Malaysia) and Burma (Myanmar) in 1942.
After serving in World War I, Wavell, who was recognized as an excellent trainer of troops, became British commander in chief for the Middle East (1939). At the high point of his career he destroyed the numerically vastly superior Italian armies in North Africa (December 1940–February 1941). In February 1941, however, Wavell had to send almost 60,000 of his troops overseas to try to prevent the German conquest of Greece and Crete. With his remaining forces he undertook a victorious offensive against the Italians in East Africa in January–May 1941. Wavell proved to be no match for the weak German forces in North Africa under Rommel, however, and he was replaced in July 1941. Moving to Southeast Asia as commander in chief, he lost Malaya and Singapore (December 1941–February 1942) and Burma (January–May 1942) to the Japanese. Again replaced in June 1943, Wavell was promoted to field marshal, raised to the peerage as Viscount Wavell of Cyrenaica and of Winchester, and appointed viceroy of India, a post that he held until 1947. In 1947 he was created an earl. Upon his death, his only son, Archibald John Arthur Wavell (1916–53), succeeded to the titles, which became extinct when he was killed in Kenya in a Mau Mau raid.
