Honorius I,  (born , Roman Campania [Italy]â€”died  Oct. 12, 638) pope from 625 to 638 whose posthumous condemnation as a heretic subsequently caused extensive controversy on the question of papal infallibility.
Nothing is known of his life before he became pope; he was elected to succeed Pope Boniface IV on Oct. 27, 625. Modeling his pontificate after Pope St. Gregory I the Great, he worked for the Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons, bestowing the pallium (i.e., the symbol of metropolitan jurisdiction) on Archbishop St. Honorius of Canterbury and Bishop St. Paulinus of York, inducing the Christian Celts to accept the Roman liturgy and date of Easter and dispatching St. Birinus (later bishop of Dorchester) to mission in the ancient English kingdom of Wessex.
