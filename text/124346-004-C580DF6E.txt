Damping-off,  disease of plant seedlings, caused by such seed- and soil-borne fungi as Rhizoctonia solani, Aphanomyces cochlioides, and species of Pythium, Phytophthora, Botrytis, Fusarium, Cylindrocladium, Diplodia, Phoma, and Alternaria. There are two types of damping-off: preemergence, in which sprouting seeds decay in soil and young seedlings rot before emergence; and postemergence, in which newly emerged seedlings suddenly wilt, collapse, and die from a soft rot at the soil line. Woody seedlings wilt and wither but remain upright; root decay often follows. Greatest losses occur in cold, wet soils in which germination and emergence are slow, often in indoor conditions.
Damping-off can be avoided by starting seed in light, well-drained, well-prepared soil or sterile mix (containing perlite, peat moss, or vermiculite); treating soil with steam, dry heat or a fumigant; avoiding overcrowding, excessive shade, overwatering, too deep planting, and overfertilizing; and sowing crack-free, healthy seed dusted with fungicide seed protectant. An early outbreak can be controlled by applying a fungicide solution.
