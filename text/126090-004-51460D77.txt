Lil Wayne, byname of Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr., also called Weezy  (born September 27, 1982, New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.) American rapper who became one of the top-selling artists in hip-hop in the early 21st century.
Lil Wayne grew up in New Orleans’s impoverished 17th Ward. There he came to the attention of Cash Money Records head Bryan Williams, and he soon became a member—with Juvenile, B.G., and Turk—of the label’s all-star group Hot Boys and won notice for the albums Get It How U Live! (1997) and Guerrilla Warfare (1999). Lil Wayne’s first solo LP, Tha Block Is Hot, arrived later in 1999 and sold more than a million copies, but two subsequent releases, Lights Out (2000) and 500 Degreez (2002), were less popular with the public.
