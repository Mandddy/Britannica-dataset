Lake District, famous scenic region and national park in the administrative county of Cumbria, England. It occupies portions of the historic counties of Cumberland, Lancashire, and Westmorland. The national park covers an area of 866 square miles (2,243 square km). It contains the principal English lakes, including the largest, Windermere, and the highest English mountains, of which the loftiest is Scafell Pike. The famous lake-strewn valleys of the region radiate from a core of central mountains, thus making through routes difficult to establish but also contributing to the distinctive character that makes the entire Lake District attractive to tourists.
The geologic structure is basically a dome, with hard, pre-Carboniferous rocks forming most of the principal summits, such as Scafell Pike (3,210 feet [978 metres]), Sca Fell (3,162 feet), and Helvellyn (3,118 feet). To the north softer Ordovician rocks give more rounded hills, such as Skiddaw (3,054 feet) and Saddleback (2,847 feet). In the south lower hills of Silurian slates and grits surround the lakes Windermere, Esthwaite Water, and Coniston Water. This structure has been influenced by glacial action that deepened existing valleys, both scooping out the rock basins that now contain the lakes and also, by truncating former tributary valleys, creating a number of “hanging valleys” with attractive waterfalls.
