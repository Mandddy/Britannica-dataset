Douglas Hyde, Irish Dubhghlas de hÍde, pseudonym An Craoibhín Aoibhinn  (born Jan. 17, 1860, Frenchpark, County Roscommon, Ire.—died July 12, 1949, Dublin) distinguished Gaelic scholar and writer and first president of the Republic of Ireland (Éire). He was the outstanding figure in the struggle for the preservation and extension of the Irish language from 1893, when he founded the Gaelic League (a nationalistic organization of Roman Catholics and Protestants), until 1922, when the founding of the Irish Free State accorded the Irish language equal status with English.
In 1884 Hyde graduated from Trinity College in Dublin, where he had first studied ancient Gaelic. He became the first professor of modern Irish at University College Dublin in 1909 and held the chair until his retirement in 1932. His most important works of scholarship are The Love Songs of Connacht (1893) and A Literary History of Ireland (1899). Other works include The Bursting of the Bubble and Other Irish Plays (1905) and Legends of Saints and Sinners (1915).
