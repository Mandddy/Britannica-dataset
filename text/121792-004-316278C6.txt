The University of Tulsa was chartered in 1894 as Henry Kendall College in Muskogee, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), replacing the Presbyterian School for Indian Girls, which had been founded in 1882. Financial problems caused officials of the Presbyterian Synod of Indian Territory to move the school to Tulsa in 1907. It was reorganized as the University of Tulsa in 1920. A petroleum engineering division was founded in 1928, graduate-level courses were authorized in 1933, and the College of Business Administration was formed in 1935. The Tulsa Law School, established in 1923, was incorporated into the University of Tulsa in 1943; it relocated to the main campus in 1973.
