Boris Karloff, original name William Henry Pratt  (born November 23, 1887, London, England—died February 2, 1969, Midhurst, West Sussex) English actor who became internationally famous for his sympathetic and chilling portrayal of the monster in the classic horror film Frankenstein (1931).
Karloff, the youngest of nine children born to Edward and Eliza Pratt, deliberately failed a consular service exam in order to pursue a career in acting. He sailed to Canada in 1909 and the following year joined a touring theatre troupe. A motion-picture extra as well as a stage actor from 1918, he played minor roles in silent films until he earned recognition for his portrayal of a convict-turned-killer—a part he had played on Broadway in 1930—in the sound film The Criminal Code (1931). When Bela Lugosi turned down the role of the monster in Universal Pictures’s adaptation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, one of Hollywood’s first important horror films, Karloff was hired for the part. The film was a sensation, and Karloff’s tender, sympathetic performance received so much critical praise that he became an overnight sensation. When the actor starred in a succession of frightening films such as The Old Dark House (1932) and The Mummy (1932), the name “Karloff” became synonymous with horror and the macabre; for a few Universal films of the period, he was billed only by his surname. He reprised the role of Frankenstein’s monster twice, in the highly regarded sequels Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and Son of Frankenstein (1939), and teamed with fellow horror star Lugosi for several films, including The Black Cat (1934), The Raven (1935), and The Body Snatcher (1945). Karloff also scored a major success on Broadway in the comedy Arsenic and Old Lace (1941) and frequently performed on radio in the 1940s in such chilling programs as Lights Out and Inner Sanctum.
