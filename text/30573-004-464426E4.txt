Johan Bojer,  (born March 6, 1872, Orkesdalsøren, near Trondheim, Norway—died July 3, 1959, Oslo) Norwegian novelist, internationally popular in the 1920s because his works dramatized topical problems of the day. He is best remembered in his own country for novels depicting folk life in the fishing-farming communities of the Lofoten Islands: Den siste viking (1921; Last of the Vikings) and Folk ved sjøen (1929; Folk by the Sea), perhaps his finest work. Both of these works are epic in conception and contain remarkable passages of description.
Born in a fisherman’s hut, Bojer grew up in extreme poverty but enjoyed early success as a writer. For many years he lived abroad, in France, Italy, Germany, and England. His reputation in the English-speaking world was established with Den store hunger (1916; The Great Hunger), a novel about the lure and shortcomings of modern technology. He also wrote an ambitious novel about America’s Norwegian immigrants, Vor egen stamme (1924; The Emigrants). Bojer’s international popularity survived into the 1940s.
