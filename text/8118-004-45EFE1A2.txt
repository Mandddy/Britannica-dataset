Basset hound, breed of dog developed centuries ago in France and long maintained, chiefly in France and Belgium, as a hunting dog of the aristocracy. Originally used to trail hares, rabbits, and deer, it has also been used in hunting birds, foxes, and other game. It is characterized as a slow, deliberate hunter, with a deep voice and a “nose” second in keenness only to that of the bloodhound. Short-legged and heavy-boned, the basset hound has long, pendulous ears and a short coat in any combination of black, tan, and white. It stands 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) and weighs 40 to 60 pounds (18 to 27 kg). There are many regional varieties of bassets in France.
