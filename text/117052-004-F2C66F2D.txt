Laughing dove, also called Senegal Dove,   (Streptopelia senegalensis), bird of the pigeon family, Columbidae (order Columbiformes), a native of African and southwest Asian scrublands that has been successfully introduced into Australia. The reddish-brown bird has blue markings on its wings, a white edge on its long tail, purplish legs, and a black bill. The copper-tipped feathers on the neck are prominent during the “bowing display” of courtship. The monogamous pair care for a clutch of two white eggs. Its call has a musical, bubbly quality, different from the cooing sound of most doves.
