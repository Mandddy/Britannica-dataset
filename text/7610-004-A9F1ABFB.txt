Cobia, also called Sergeant Fish, orCrabeater,   (species Rachycentron canadum), swift-moving, slim marine game fish, the only member of the family Rachycentridae (order Perciformes). The cobia is found in most warm oceans. A voracious, predatory fish, it may be 1.8 m (6 feet) long and weigh 70 kg (150 pounds) or more. It has a jutting lower jaw, a rather flat head, and light-brown sides, each with two lengthwise, brown stripes. The dorsal fin, a distinctive feature, consists of a row of short spines followed by a long, soft-rayed fin.
