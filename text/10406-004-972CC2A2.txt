Stanisław Koniecpolski,  (born c. 1591—died  March 12, 1646, Brody, Pol.) military and political leader of Poland who won major victories against the Turks, the Tatars, and the Swedes.
Appointed field commander of the Polish forces in 1619, Koniecpolski was captured during the Battle of Cecorą (Ţuţora; 1620) by the Turks and held prisoner at Istanbul for three years. On returning to Poland, he defeated the Tatars (vassals of the Turks) at Martynów (1624), received the thanks of the Polish Sejm (Diet), and was made palatine of Sandomierz by King Sigismund III. In 1626 he was transferred to Prussia, where the Poles were engaged in a bitter conflict with the Swedish king Gustavus II Adolphus. Koniecpolski subsequently won a series of victories in 1627 at Puck, at Hamersztyn (Czarne), and at Tczew. But he was also compelled to withdraw from strategic Polish strongholds in Prussia (1628), and, despite his victory over Gustavus at Trzcianka (June 27, 1629), the Polish-Swedish Truce of Altmark (Sept. 25, 1629) acknowledged Sweden as the dominant power on the southern Baltic Sea coast.
