Laurence Fishburne, in full Laurence John Fishburne III  (born July 30, 1961, Augusta, Georgia, U.S.) American actor noted for the intensity of his performances. He was the recipient of a Tony Award (1992) for his work in August Wilson’s play Two Trains Running, and he also earned multiple Emmy Awards. He is probably best known, however, for his role as Morpheus in the Matrix film trilogy.
Fishburne began acting as a child, making his film debut in Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975) at age 14. He then lied about his age to win the part of Clean, a gunner on a swift boat in Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now (1979). The experience of filming in the Philippines with a veteran moviemaking cast and crew had a profound impact on Fishburne, who became committed to succeeding in Hollywood. Initially he found only roles as hoodlums, and he was happy to take the part of the lighthearted Cowboy Curtis on the children’s television show Pee-Wee’s Playhouse. He worked again with Coppola in Rumble Fish (1983) and Cotton Club (1984) and with directors Steven Spielberg in The Color Purple (1985) and Spike Lee in School Daze (1988).
