Zagwe dynasty, also spelled Zague,  line of 12th- and 13th-century Ethiopian kings who combined a nomadic military life with an impassioned desire to build monuments to their Christian religion. Their tenuous pretensions to succession, based on a legendary marriage to a daughter of one of the last Aksumite kings, the line they deposed, was subsequently confirmed by the church; in return for its support, liberal royal endowments were granted.
Descended mainly from the Agau (Agaw, or Agew) people, the house of Zagwe originated in the district of Bugna, and its kings moved the administrative capital to Roha (now named Lalibela), in the safety of their native Lasta Mountains. The Zagwe kings ruled much of what is now northern and central Ethiopia, but any pretensions they may have had to control the hilly country east of the Shewa Plateau lapsed as the region was increasingly occupied by such Muslim states as Ifat and Hadya.
