Mount Unzen eruption of 1792, volcanic eruption of Mount Unzen, western Kyushu, Japan, that led to a destructive landslide and a tsunami. The death toll from the disaster is estimated at some 15,000 people, making it the most deadly volcanic eruption in Japan’s history.
Mount Unzen actually consists of a group of composite volcanoes located on Japan’s Shimabara Peninsula east of Nagasaki. The area was the site of a major volcanic eruption in 1792. After an initial eruption, a large earthquake triggered a landslide from the Mayuyama peak, a 4,000-year-old lava dome rising above the city of Shimabara. The massive landslide swept through the city and eventually reached the Ariake Sea, where it set off a tsunami. The wave surge devastated nearby areas, causing further widespread damage and death. Most of the estimated 15,000 deaths caused by the event are believed to have resulted from the landslide and the tsunami. The scar created from the Mayuyama landslide remains visible today.
