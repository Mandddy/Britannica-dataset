Spencer Tracy, in full Spencer Bonaventure Tracy   (born April 5, 1900, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.—died  June 10, 1967, Beverly Hills, California) rough-hewn American film star who was one of Hollywood’s greatest male leads and the first actor to receive two consecutive Academy Awards for best actor.
As a youth Tracy was bored by schoolwork and joined the navy at age 17. Despite his distaste for academics, he eventually became a premed student at Wisconsin’s Ripon College. While there, he auditioned for and won a role in the commencement play and discovered acting to be more to his liking than medicine. In 1922 he went to New York, where he and his friend Pat O’Brien enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. That same year, both men made their joint Broadway debut, playing bit roles as robots in Karel Čapek’s R.U.R. For the next eight years, Tracy bounced between featured parts in short-running Broadway plays and leading roles in regional stock companies, finally achieving stardom when he was cast as death-row inmate Killer Mears in the 1930 Broadway hit The Last Mile. He subsequently appeared in two Vitaphone short subjects, but he was displeased with himself and pessimistic about his chances for screen stardom.
