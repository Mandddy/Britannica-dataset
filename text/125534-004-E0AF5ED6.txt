Philo Farnsworth, in full Philo Taylor Farnsworth II  (born August 19, 1906, Beaver, Utah, U.S.â€”died March 11, 1971, Salt Lake City, Utah) American inventor who developed the first all-electronic television system.
Farnsworth was a technical prodigy from an early age. An avid reader of science magazines as a teenager, he became interested in the problem of television and was convinced that mechanical systems that used, for example, a spinning disc would be too slow to scan and assemble images many times a second. Only an electronic system could scan and assemble an image fast enough, and by 1922 he had worked out the basic outlines of electronic television.
