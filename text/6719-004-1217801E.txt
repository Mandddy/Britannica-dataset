Bloodroot, also called red puccoon,  (Sanguinaria canadensis), plant of the poppy family (Papaveraceae), native throughout eastern and midwestern North America. It grows in deciduous woodlands, where it blooms in early spring. Bloodroot has a shining white, eight-petalled, cup-shaped flower with bright yellow stamens (male reproductive structures) in the centre. The 4- to 6-centimetre (2-inch) flower is borne on a 20-cm reddish stalk. Large, veiny, half-opened leaves on red stalks enfold the flower stem; after the flower has bloomed, these open into much-lobed, blue-green, round leaves. The orange-red sap, formerly used by the Indians for dye, is found in the horizontal rootstocks (rhizomes), which also contain the medical alkaloid sanguinarine. Demand from the natural-food industry for Sanguinaria has depleted wild populations of the plant, though it is also considered toxic.
The species and a variety, S. canadensis, forma multiplex ‘Plena,’ which has showy double flowers, can be planted in the wild garden.
