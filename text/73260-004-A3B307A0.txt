Rorqual (genus Balaenoptera), any of five particular species of baleen whales—specifically the blue whale, fin whale, sei whale, Bryde’s whale, and minke whale. The term is often extended to include the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangeliae), the only other member of the family Balaenopteridae, in which case rorqual becomes synonymous with the family name.
Rorquals are distinguished from other baleen whales by the presence of ventral grooves extending from the chin and lower jaw margins down the throat to the belly. These allow the mouth cavity to expand into the throat and make gulp-feeding practical (see cetacean: Feeding adaptations).
