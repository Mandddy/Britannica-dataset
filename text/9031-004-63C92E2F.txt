Ti (genus Cordyline), genus of tropical trees and shrubs in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae), native to Asia, Australia, and some Pacific islands. Many are grown as ornamental plants. The underground stems of some species are used for food and the long leaves for roofing material and clothing.
Ti, or ti tree (Cordyline australis), is a common ornamental. In the wild it is a tree up to about 12 metres (40 feet) tall with a crown of long leaves, but it is much shorter when grown as a houseplant. It has green or white flowers and thick roots. The fruit is a berry. Other species, especially cabbage palm (C. fruticosa), also are cultivated, and many horticultural varieties with colourful leaves have been developed.
