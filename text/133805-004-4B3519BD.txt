Eugène Fromentin,  (born Oct. 24, 1820, La Rochelle, Fr.—died  Aug. 27, 1876, La Rochelle) French painter and author, best known for his depictions of the land and people of Algeria.
Influenced successively by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Eugène Delacroix, Fromentin abandoned his early stiffness in design and execution and developed into a brilliant colourist. “Fauconnier arabe” and “Chasse au héron” clearly show his debt to Delacroix.
