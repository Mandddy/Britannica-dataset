Sir Tim Rice, original name in full Timothy Miles Bindon Rice  (born November 10, 1944, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England) English lyricist who coauthored some of the most successful stage and film musicals of the 20th century.
After singing briefly with the pop group the Aardvarks during his late teens, Rice temporarily sidelined his passion for music to go to law school. In 1965, however, while still on track toward the legal profession, he was introduced to Andrew Lloyd Webber, a young composer in need of a lyricist, and the two began what would become a long-term musical partnership. Although their first stage musical, The Likes of Us (1965), went unperformed for 40 years, Rice decided to abandon his legal aspirations to pursue his musical interests. He went to work in the music industry—first as an administrative trainee and then as an executive assistant—while continuing his collaboration with Lloyd Webber. The biblically inspired oratorio Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1968) was their next production. Composed originally for a school chorus at the request of a family friend of Lloyd Webber, the work met with unexpected success and later, as an expanded stage show, became a smash hit in the United Kingdom and, eventually, across the globe.
