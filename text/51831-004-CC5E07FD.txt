Bat bug (family Polyctenidae), any of about 20 species of bloodsucking insects (order Heteroptera) that are external parasites found mainly in the fur of tropical bats. The adult (between 3.5 and 5 mm [0.14 and 0.2 inch] long) lacks eyes and wings. Its forelegs are short and thick, and its middle and hindlegs are long and slender. As indicated by the family name, the bat bug has from one to many (poly) comblike rows of spines (ctenidia) on its body. The young are born alive in an advanced stage of development.
The bat bug is closely related to the bedbug.
