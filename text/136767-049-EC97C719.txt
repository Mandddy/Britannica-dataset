Triton, U.S. nuclear-powered submarine that was the first vessel to circumnavigate the globe underwater. The Triton completed its circumnavigation on its maiden voyage, officially beginning the mission in the mid-Atlantic on Feb. 24, 1960. It proceeded west around Cape Horn, crossed the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and rounded the Cape of Good Hope before returning to the same location 60 days and 21 hours later, on May 10.
At the time of its launch in August 1958, the Triton was the largest and most powerfully engined submarine. It was 447.5 feet (136 metres) long and displaced 5,900 tons, and its two nuclear reactors gave the vessel a speed of 30 knots (nautical miles per hour) and a range of about 110,000 miles (180,000 km) without refueling. Triton was the first submarine designed and built to serve as a “radar picket” for U.S. surface fleets, providing early warning of approaching enemy aircraft. Within a year of its beginning radar picket duties for the Atlantic fleet, following its circumnavigation of the globe, Triton and all other radar picket submarines were made obsolete by advances in land-based and aircraft-carrier-based early warning systems. The submarine served briefly as a shore-based flagship at Norfolk naval base in Virginia before being decommissioned in 1969. In 1995 it was towed to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for scrapping.
