Wiltshire, administrative, geographic, and historic county of southern England. It is situated on a low plateau draining into the basins of the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the eastward-flowing River Thames. Trowbridge, on the western side of the county, is the administrative centre.
The administrative, geographic, and historic counties occupy slightly different areas. The administrative county of Wiltshire is bounded to the north by the administrative county of Gloucestershire, to the northeast by the unitary authority of Swindon, to the east by the unitary authority of West Berkshire, to the southeast by the administrative county of Hampshire, to the south by the administrative county of Dorset, to the southwest by the administrative county of Somerset, and to the west by the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset and the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire. Until 2009 the administrative county was divided into four districts: Salisbury, West Wiltshire, Kennet, and North Wiltshire.The geographic county encompasses the entire administrative county together with the unitary authority of Swindon. The historic county of Wiltshire is nearly coterminous with the geographic county but also includes a small area north of Sherston in the district of Cotswold in the administrative county of Gloucestershire.
