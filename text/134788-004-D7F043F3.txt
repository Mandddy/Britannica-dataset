Harry F. Sinclair, in full Harry Ford Sinclair   (born July 6, 1876, Wheeling, West Virginia, U.S.—died November 10, 1956, Pasadena, California) American oilman who founded Sinclair Oil Corporation, a major integrated petroleum company of the early and mid-20th century. He also figured in the Teapot Dome Scandal in the 1920s.
Sinclair grew up in Independence, Kansas, and studied pharmacy at the University of Kansas (1897–98). After making an unsuccessful attempt in the drugstore business (1898–1901), he decided to venture into the oil fields, which were in the early phase of their development in the central part of the country. Initially a lease broker, he subsequently became an independent producer of oil wells in Oklahoma and finally entered refining and marketing. In 1916 he consolidated his interests into Sinclair Oil and Refining Corporation (later renamed Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation), headquartered in New York City. Within a few years he became a major independent producer with holdings worldwide. During World War I he served on the Council of National Defense, a board that advised on the mobilization of raw materials and industry for the war effort.
