Bobolink,  (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), American bird of the family Icteridae (order Passeriformes) that breeds in northern North America and winters chiefly in central South America. Migrating flocks may raid rice fields, and at one time the fat “ricebirds” were shot as a table delicacy. In the breeding season the 18-centimetre (7-inch) male bobolink—named for his bubbling song—has a black underside, yellow hindneck, white back and rump, and white patches on the wings; in winter he resembles the brown female.
