Armoured vehicle, armoured also spelled armored,  military vehicle that is fitted with partial or complete armour plating for protection against bullets, shell fragments, and other projectiles. Armoured vehicles for military use can move either on wheels or on continuous tracks. The tank is the principal fighting armoured vehicle. Other types armed with large-calibre main guns include tank destroyers and assault guns. This article traces the development of armoured personnel carriers, infantry fighting vehicles, and other armoured vehicles designed primarily as platforms for assault troops.
Armoured personnel carriers (APCs) are tracked armoured vehicles that are used for transporting infantry into battle. APCs first appeared in large numbers early in World War II, when the German army adopted them to carry the infantry contingents of their panzer and panzer grenadier divisions into battle. After World War II, improvements to APCs made them even more capable of accompanying tanks into battle.
