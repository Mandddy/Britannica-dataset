        Greek: Caulker)  (died after 1042) Byzantine emperor (1041–42). The nephew of Michael IV, Michael Calaphates was adopted by his uncle’s elderly wife, Empress Zoe. Several months after his accession to the throne (Dec. 10, 1041), he exiled Zoe to a convent. An uprising erupted, however, and to stem it Michael hurriedly recalled her. Nevertheless, his political opponents had him deposed, blinded, and sent to a monastery.
