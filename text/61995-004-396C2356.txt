Alice Evans,  (born January 29, 1881, Neath, Pennsylvania, U.S.â€”died September 5, 1975, Arlington, Virginia) American scientist whose landmark work on pathogenic bacteria in dairy products was central in gaining acceptance of the pasteurization process to prevent disease.
After completing high school, Evans taught for four years before enrolling in a two-year course for rural teachers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. There she became interested in science and completed a B.S. at Cornell and an M.S. at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, both in bacteriology. She was encouraged to continue for a doctorate but chose instead to work on the bacteriology of milk and cheese for the dairy division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Her work on the bacteria of milk led to her groundbreaking work on brucellosis, a bacterial infection (not yet known by that name) that she determined could cause both spontaneous abortions in animals and remittent fever in humans.
