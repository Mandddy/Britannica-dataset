Sir Donald Francis Tovey,  (born July 17, 1875, Eton, Berkshire, Eng.—died July 10, 1940, Edinburgh, Scot.) English pianist and composer, known particularly for his works of musical scholarship.
Tovey studied the piano and counterpoint and graduated from the University of Oxford in 1898. Between 1900 and 1902 he gave recitals of his works in London, Berlin, and Vienna. In 1903 he played his Piano Concerto in London, and between 1906 and 1912 he organized concerts of chamber music at Chelsea. Besides the Piano Concerto his compositions include two string quartets, the opera The Bride of Dionysus (first produced in 1929), and a cello concerto (1934). In 1914 he was appointed Reid Professor of Music at the University of Edinburgh, and in 1917 he founded there the Reid Symphony Orchestra. For the concerts given by this orchestra Tovey wrote analytical notes dealing with problems of composition in a perspicacious and lively manner; these notes were published as Essays in Musical Analysis, 6 vol. (1935–39). They set styles in musical analysis, as, for example, Tovey’s distinction between music in and on the dominant—when the music has not fully modulated and when it has.
