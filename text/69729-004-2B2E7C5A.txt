Inge de Bruijn,  (born August 24, 1973, Barendrecht, Netherlands) Dutch swimmer whose eight Olympic medals (2000, 2004) and five world championships made her one of the most successful competitors in women’s swimming history.
De Bruijn began swimming at age 7 and participated in her first international meet at age 12. She joined swimming’s elite when she took four medals at the 1991 European championships in Athens. Food poisoning almost forced her to miss the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, but she competed and finished eighth in the 50-metre freestyle and ninth in the 100-metre butterfly. As the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta approached, however, de Bruijn’s enthusiasm for swimming was waning. Even after making the national team, she skipped practices or showed up late. Jacco Verhaeren, her coach and boyfriend, asked her to leave the team.
