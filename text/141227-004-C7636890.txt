Dacia, in antiquity, an area of central Europe bounded by the Carpathian Mountains and covering much of the historical region of Transylvania (modern north-central and western Romania).
The Dacian people had earlier occupied lands south of the Danube and north of the mountains, and those lands as a Roman province eventually included wider territories both to the north and to the east. The Dacians were of Thracian stock and, among the Thracian successor peoples in the region, were most akin to the Getae. (Indeed, the similarities between the groups led the Greek historian Herodotus to label both as Getae, while the Romans referred to all these populations as Dacians.) They first appeared in the Athenian slave market in the 4th century bce. Subsequently they traded with the Greeks (importing especially wine) and used Greek coins. They spoke a Thracian dialect but were influenced culturally by the neighbouring Scythians—from whom they adopted the cult of the Scythian deity Zalmoxis and a belief in immortality—and by Celtic invaders of the 4th century bce.
