Bouillabaisse,  complex fish soup originating on the Mediterranean coast of France, one of the glories of Proven√ßal cuisine. Recipes for bouillabaisse abound, but the Marseilles formulation is generally acknowledged as the most authentic; it contains, besides fish and shellfish, olive oil, onions, tomatoes, garlic, parsley, saffron, fennel, thyme, bay leaf, and orange peel. True bouillabaisse must be made with Mediterranean fish, including the essential racasse (a bony rock fish), plus whiting, conger eel, mullet, chapon, saint-pierre, and a number of others. Spiny lobsters and crabs are used, as are mussels in the Parisian version of the dish. All the ingredients must be quickly boiled together. Rouille, a paste of garlic, red pepper, bread crumbs, and fish stock, is added at table as a condiment to heighten the flavour. Bouillabaisse has inspired literary praise in verse and prose, notably a ballad by William Makepeace Thackeray on his enjoying a bouillabaisse in Paris.
