Honey guide, any of about 17 species of birds constituting the family Indicitoridae (order Piciformes). The honey guide gets its name from two African species, the greater, or black-throated, honey guide (Indicator indicator) and the scaly-throated honey guide (I. variegatus), that exhibit a unique pattern of behaviour: the bird leads a ratel (honey badger) or a man to a bees’ nest by its chattering and flying ahead; after the larger animal takes honey, the bird eats the wax (the only vertebrate known to do so) and bee larvae.
Eight other nonguiding species in Africa, one in the Himalayas, and one in Malaysia are also members of the family. All are small, tough-skinned birds that feed chiefly on bees and wasps. Some are brood parasitic (i.e., they lay their eggs in the nests of other birds), usually choosing a hole nester (barbet, woodpecker) as foster parent. The hatchling has a pair of temporary bill hooks, which it uses to kill or injure the host’s young.
