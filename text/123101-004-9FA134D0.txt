Zamia, a genus of 55 species of cycads (family Zamiaceae), small, stocky, fern-like plants native to tropical and subtropical America. They have a turniplike, mostly underground stem that in some species reaches 3 metres (10 feet) or more in height. A starchy food is obtained from the crushed roots and stems of certain species, among them coontie, or comfortroot (Z. integrifolia), found in the southeastern United States and the West Indies.
