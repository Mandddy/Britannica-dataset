Nicholas Hawksmoor,  (born c. 1661, probably at East Drayton, Nottinghamshire, Eng.—died  March 25, 1736, London) English architect whose association with Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Vanbrugh long diverted critical attention from the remarkable originality of his own Baroque designs for churches and other institutional buildings.
Hawksmoor began to work for Wren about 1679 and owed his professional advancement in part to the political influence of the elder architect. He aided Wren in building St. Paul’s Cathedral (completed 1710) in London and Vanbrugh in constructing Castle Howard (1699–1726) in Yorkshire and Blenheim Palace (1705–25) in Oxfordshire. On Wren’s death (1723), Hawksmoor became surveyor general (chief architect) of Westminster Abbey, the west towers of which were built (1734–45) to his design. Earlier (from 1692) he was responsible for various university buildings at Oxford.
