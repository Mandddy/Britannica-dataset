Dhole (Cuon alpinus), also called red dog,  wild Asian carnivore of the dog family (Canidae), found in central and southeastern wooded areas and distinguished structurally by the lack of one pair of lower molars. Its length ranges between 76 and 100 cm (30 and 40 inches), exclusive of the 28–48-centimetre (11–19-inch) tail, and its weight is from 14 to 21 kg (30 to 46 pounds). Coloration varies from yellowish to reddish brown, often with lighter underparts. Dholes hunt various mammals, generally associating in packs of up to 30 individuals; they usually hunt such prey as deer and wild sheep but are reported to attack animals as large as tigers and bears. A litter usually contains two to six pups, born after a nine-week gestation period.
