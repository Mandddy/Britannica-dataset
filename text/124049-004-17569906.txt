Passaic River, river, rising near Morristown, southeastern Morris county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S. It flows south past Millington, then north and east to Paterson and its Great Falls (70 feet [21 metres] high), at which point it turns south and east past Passaic and Newark and into Newark Bay. Some 80 miles (130 km) long and with a drainage area of 935 square miles (2,422 square km), the river has been intensively developed as a source of power and water. The river is prone to flooding, its most serious inundation occurring in 1903. Major tributaries are the Whippany, Rockaway, Pequannock, Wanaque, and Ramapo rivers. The name is derived from an Algonquian word meaning “peaceful valley.”
