Mortimer J. Adler, in full Mortimer Jerome Adler  (born December 28, 1902, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 28, 2001, San Mateo, California) American philosopher, educator, editor, and advocate of adult and general education by study of the great writings of the Western world.
While still in public school, Adler was taken on as a copyboy by the New York Sun, where he stayed for two years doing a variety of editorial work full-time. He then attended Columbia University, completed his coursework for a bachelor’s degree, but did not receive a diploma because he had refused physical education (swimming). He stayed at Columbia to teach and earn a Ph.D. (1928) and then became professor of the philosophy of law at the University of Chicago. There, with Robert M. Hutchins, he became a proponent of the pursuit of liberal education through regular discussions based on reading great books. He had studied under John Erskine in a special honours course at Columbia in which the “best sellers of ancient times” were read as a “cultural basis for human understanding and communication.”
