Allometry, also called biological scaling,  in biology, the change in organisms in relation to proportional changes in body size. An example of allometry can be seen in mammals. Ranging from the mouse to the elephant, as the body gets larger, in general hearts beat more slowly, brains get bigger, bones get proportionally shorter and thinner, and life spans lengthen. Even ecologically flexible characteristics, such as population density and the size of home ranges, scale in a predictive way with body size. The study of allometry stems from work in the late 19th century by the Scottish zoologist Dâ€™arcy Thompson and in the early 20th century by the English biologist Julian Huxley, the latter of whom coined the term for this field of study.
Scaling is often considered to be one of the few laws in biology. Allometric equations take the general form Y = aMb, where Y is some biological variable, M is a measure of body size, and b is some scaling exponent. In allometry, equations are often presented in logarithmic form so that a diverse range of body sizes can be plotted on a single graph.
