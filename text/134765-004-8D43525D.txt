Walther von Brauchitsch, in full Heinrich Alfred Walther von Brauchitsch  (born Oct. 4, 1881, Berlin, Ger.—died Oct. 18, 1948, Hamburg, W.Ger.) German field marshal and army commander in chief during the first part of World War II, who was instrumental in planning and carrying out the campaigns against Poland (September 1939), the Netherlands, Belgium, France (May–June 1940), the Balkans (April–May 1941), and the Soviet Union (June–December 1941).
Commissioned to the Prussian guard in 1900, Brauchitsch was an officer on the general staff in World War I. As the advent of Hitler brought expansion of the army, he was chief of the East Prussian military district, commanded the 4th Army Group (1937), and, when Col. Gen. Werner Freiherr von Fritsch was forced to retire, succeeded him as head of the army in 1938. Hitler, however, was making most of the military decisions by the winter of 1941–42.
