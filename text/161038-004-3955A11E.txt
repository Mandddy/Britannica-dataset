Louis Hémon,  (born October 12, 1880, Brest, France—died July 8, 1913, near Chapleau, Ontario, Canada) French author of Maria Chapdelaine, the best-known novel of French Canadian pioneer life.
After a few years in England as a journalist and sportswriter, Hémon went to Canada in 1911 and, while working as a farmhand, completed Maria Chapdelaine. The book is a realistic presentation of the struggle of men and women faced with the inhospitable soil and climate of the Lake St. John area in Quebec. Though there was some resentment over Hémon’s failure to idealize French Canadian life, the book soon became a model for Canadian regionalist writers. Initially serialized in a Paris magazine, Le Temps (1914), the novel appeared in book form in 1916, went through many editions, and was translated into all the major languages. Hémon did not live to see its success: he was killed in a train accident before it was published.
