William Edwin Orchard,  (born November 20, 1877, Buckinghamshire, England—died June 12, 1955, Brownhills, Staffordshire) English ecumenical priest who strove for a closer understanding between Protestants and Roman Catholics. He entered Westminster College, Cambridge, to prepare for the Presbyterian ministry and in 1904 was ordained and became a minister at Enfield, Middlesex. After receiving a Doctor of Divinity in 1909, he became minister of the King’s Weigh House Congregational Church, London, in 1914.
Throughout World War I, Orchard’s preaching attracted large congregations. The courage of his ministry was shown by his braving a hostile mob in Trafalgar Square, London, to conduct a prayer meeting aimed at ending the war. Seeking a worldwide Christianity, he introduced Roman Catholic thought and practices into his services and attempted a rapprochement with the Church of England, a plan that collapsed after prolonged negotiations.
