Horace Greeley,  (born Feb. 3, 1811, Amherst, N.H., U.S.—died Nov. 29, 1872, New York, N.Y.) American newspaper editor who is known especially for his vigorous articulation of the North’s antislavery sentiments during the 1850s.
Greeley was a printer’s apprentice in East Poultney, Vt., until moving to New York City in 1831, where he eventually became a founding editor of a new literary paper, The New-Yorker (1834). A liberal Whig, Greeley caught the attention of New York political boss Thurlow Weed and was asked to issue political campaign weeklies during the elections of 1838 and 1840. These publications substantially aided the Whig cause and marked the beginning of Greeley’s political partnership with Weed and New York Gov. William H. Seward (U.S. secretary of state, 1861–69)—a partnership that lasted until 1854.
