Chub,  any of several freshwater fishes of the carp family, Cyprinidae, common in Europe and North America. Chubs are good bait fish, and large specimens are caught for sport or food.
The European chub (Leuciscus cephalus) is a popular, though not especially palatable, game fish found in Europe and Great Britain, primarily in rivers. A large-mouthed fish with large, black-edged scales, it attains a maximum length and weight of about 60 cm (2 feet) and 7–8 kg (15–18 pounds). It is voracious and preys on insects, plants, and other fish.
