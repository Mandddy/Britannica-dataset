Micrometer, in full micrometer caliper,  instrument for making precise linear measurements of dimensions such as diameters, thicknesses, and lengths of solid bodies; it consists of a C-shaped frame with a movable jaw operated by an integral screw. The fineness of the measurement that can be made depends on the lead of the screwâ€”i.e., the amount the spindle moves toward or away from the anvil in one revolution and the means provided for indicating fractional parts of a revolution. The accuracy of the measurements depends on the accuracy of the screw-nut combination.
Although the prefix micro indicates one-millionth, the corresponding length of 0.000001 metre is known as a micron. See angstrom.
