Boulevard,  broad landscaped avenue typically permitting several lanes of vehicular traffic as well as pedestrian walkways. The earliest boulevards were built in the ancient Middle East, especially at Antioch.
Commonly a major axis in a city, the boulevard permits long picturesque views, the foliage along the boulevard minimizing peripheral visual distraction. Straight and geometrically precise boulevards were a hallmark of the design principles taught at the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, while winding avenues are more common to the naturalistic schools of city planning that have come into being since the latter part of the 19th century.
