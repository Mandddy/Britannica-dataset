Alster River,  tributary of the Elbe River in northern Germany. It rises 4 miles (6 km) southeast of Kaltenkirchen and flows generally south for 30 miles (50 km) to Hamburg, where a dam was built along its course in the Middle Ages. The river then continues to the Elbe in two parallel canals, which mark the division between the newer (since 17th century) part of Hamburg to the west and the older section to the east. A lake formed behind the dam is separated into two parts by fortifications built in the early 17th century to help preserve Hamburg’s independence through the Thirty Years’ War. The lake’s southern portion is called Binnenalster (“Inner Alster”) and the northern, Aussenalster (“Outer Alster”).
