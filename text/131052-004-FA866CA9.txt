Magpie, any of several long-tailed birds belonging to the family Corvidae (order Passeriformes). The best-known species, often called the black-billed magpie (Pica pica), is a 45-centimetre (18-inch) black-and-white (i.e., pied) bird, with an iridescent blue-green tail. It occurs in northwestern Africa, across Eurasia, and in western North America. A bird of farmlands and tree-studded open country, it eats insects, seeds, small vertebrates, the eggs and young of other birds, and fresh carrion. It makes a large round nest of twigs cemented with mud.
Brilliant blue or green magpies in Asia include those of the genera Cyanopica, Cissa, and Urocissa. For Australasian magpies, see bell-magpie.
