Organic farming, also called organic gardening,  system of crop cultivation employing biological methods of fertilization and pest control as substitutes for chemical fertilizers and pesticides; the latter products are regarded by proponents of organic methods as injurious to health and the environment and unnecessary for successful cultivation.
Organic farming as a conscious rejection of modern agri-chemical techniques had its origin in the 1930s, when Sir Albert Howard, a British agricultural scientist, introduced a system of holistic and natural animal and plant husbandry in which town wastes were returned to the soil for utilization as nutrient material. The practice has been employed in portions of every continent where miscellaneous organic materials, including animal manure, sewage sludge, compost, grass turf, straw, and other crop residues, are applied to fields to improve both soil structure and moisture-holding capacity and to nourish soil life, which in turn nourishes plants; chemical fertilizers, by contrast, feed plants directly.
