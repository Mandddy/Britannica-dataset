Potala Palace, immense religious and administrative complex in Lhasa, southern Tibet Autonomous Region, southwestern China. It is situated atop Mar-po-ri (Red Mountain), 425 feet (130 metres) above the Lhasa River valley, and rises up dramatically from its rocky base. Potrang Karpo (completed 1648; White Palace) once served as the seat of the Tibetan government and the main residence of the Dalai Lama; from the mid-18th century it was used as a winter palace. Potrang Marpo (1694; Red Palace) houses several chapels, sacred statues, and the tombs of eight Dalai Lamas; it remains a major pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists.
King Srong-brtsan-sgam-po commissioned the building of a palace in Lhasa in the 7th century. Significantly smaller and less elaborate than its 5-square-mile (13-square-km) successor, it was named the Potala (“Pure Land” or “High Heavenly Realm”) for reasons that are not historically documented, although Mount Potala in India seems the likely source. Tibetan Buddhists acknowledge the Dalai Lama as the incarnation of Avalokiteshvara (Chinese: Guanyin), a bodhisattva whose home was on Mount Potala.
