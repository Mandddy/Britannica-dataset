Quapaw, also called Akansaor Arkansas,  North American Indian people of the Dhegiha branch of the Siouan language stock. With the other members of this subgroup (including the Osage, Ponca, Kansa, and Omaha), the Quapaw migrated westward from the Atlantic coast. They settled for a time on the prairies of what is now western Missouri and later relocated at or near the mouth of the Arkansas River. They were a sedentary, agricultural people who lived in fortified villages of communal bark-covered lodges built on mounds. They were also skillful artisans noted for their red-on-white pottery.
In 1673 the Quapaw were contacted by the explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet, who reported that the tribe did not hunt buffalo for fear of the peoples to the north and west, wore few clothes, and pierced their ears and noses. In 1818 the Quapaw ceded their lands, except for a tract on the southern side of the Arkansas River, to the United States. A few years later this land was opened to emigrant settlers, and most of the tribe relocated to the Red River in present Louisiana. When floods drove them out of this region, they began an unsuccessful campaign for the return of their original lands. In the mid-19th century they settled on their own reservation in Indian Territory (present Oklahoma), but during the American Civil War their land was so overrun by forces from both sides that tribal members fled en masse to Kansas to the reservation of the Ottawa. Most of the Quapaw later returned to their Oklahoma land, which was allotted among them by themselves.
