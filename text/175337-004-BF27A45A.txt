A Boy Named Charlie Brown, American animated musical film, released in 1969, that was the first of several features based on Charles M. Schulz’s popular comic strip Peanuts.
The story follows the ups and downs in the life of schoolchild and hapless everyman Charlie Brown; his irascible pet beagle, Snoopy; and his eccentric group of neighbourhood friends, including the bullying Lucy and her younger brother, Linus, who is never seen without his security blanket. Nominally about Charlie’s preparation for a high-stakes national spelling bee, the film is less concerned with plot than with message: that when life throws a curveball, one should brush off disappointment and try again.
