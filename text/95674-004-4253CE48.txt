Harbin, Wade-Giles romanization Ha-erh-pin,  city, capital of Heilongjiang sheng (province), northeastern China. It is located on the south bank of the Sungari (Songhua) River. The site of the city is generally level to undulating, except near the river itself, where low bluffs lead down to the floodplain in places; low-lying areas are subject to flooding. The climate is cool, with cold winters that last four or five months; subzero overnight low temperatures are common and can reach −40 °F (−40 °C). Pop. (2003 est.) 2,735,100.
The city owes its origin to the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway through Manchuria (Northeast China) by the Russians at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Before 1896 it was a small fishing village named Alejin (“Honour”; Harbin is derived from it) by the Juchen, the ancestors of the Manchu. Thereafter it became the construction centre for the railway, which by 1904 linked the Trans-Siberian Railroad from a point east of Lake Baikal in Siberia with the Russian port of Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Harbin was a base for Russian military operations in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), and after the war it was temporarily under joint Chinese-Japanese administration. It became a haven for refugees from Russia after the Revolution of 1917 and for a time had the largest Russian population of any city outside the Soviet Union.
