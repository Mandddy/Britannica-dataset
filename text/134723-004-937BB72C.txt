Marc Jacobs,  (born April 9, 1963, New York, New York, U.S.) American fashion designer renowned for his sartorial interpretations of trends in popular culture, perhaps most notably his “grunge” collection, which was credited with launching the grunge look of the 1990s.
Jacobs was raised with his brother and sister in New York City, where his parents were employed as agents for the William Morris talent agency. When Jacobs was seven years old, his father died. His mother subsequently remarried and divorced several times, each of which required the family to relocate. When Jacobs was a teenager, he went to live on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with his paternal grandmother, who, having taught him as a child how to knit, encouraged his growing interest in fashion design. By age 15, he had enrolled in the High School of Art and Design and was working at the upscale clothing boutique Charivari, where he met the fashion designer Perry Ellis, who became his mentor.
