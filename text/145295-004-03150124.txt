George Carey, in full George Leonard Carey, Baron Carey of Clifton  (born Nov. 13, 1935, London, Eng.) archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, theologian noted for his evangelical beliefs.
Carey left school at age 15 and served as a radio operator in the Royal Air Force from 1954 to 1956. By 20 he had undergone a religious conversion—not Paul’s experience on the road to Damascus, he admitted, but the simple conviction that he had found something special. He was then admitted to King’s College, London University, from which he received a bachelor of divinity degree in 1962. Beginning his clerical career as a curate in Islington (1962–66), Carey was also a lecturer at Oakhill College in Southgate (1966–70) and at St. John’s College in Nottingham (1970–75). He was vicar of St. Nicholas Church in Durham (1975–82) and principal of Trinity College, Bristol (1982–87). In 1987 Carey was made bishop of Bath and Wells, and in 1990 he was named to succeed as archbishop of Canterbury.
