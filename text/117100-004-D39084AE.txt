Schwingen,  (German: “swinging”), form of wrestling native to Switzerland and the Tirolese valleys. Wrestlers wear Schwinghosen (wrestling breeches) with strong belts on which holds are taken. Lifting and tripping are common, and the first man down loses the bout. Schwingen tournaments were organized as early as 1805.
