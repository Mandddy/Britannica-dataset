Chrysaora, genus of marine jellyfish of the class Scyphozoa (phylum Cnidaria) that is found in all temperate and tropical seas around the world.
The principal species of this jellyfish is Chrysaora hysoscella, also often called the compass jellyfish. The bell-shaped body of this variety is roughly hemispherical and smooth and measures as much as 200 mm (8 inches) in diameter. Sixteen brown, V-shaped radial markings point to the centre of the bell, typically against a background of cream to yellowish brown, though many other colours have been observed. Four long tentacles, commonly called mouth, or oral, arms, hang from the centre of the underside, where the mouth of the jellyfish is located. In most cases, 24 other, thinner extensile tentacles hang from the rim of the bell. Uniformly ciliated larvae, or planula, are brooded within the adult. The larvae develop into normal sessile (attached) forms, which give rise to medusae (i.e., free-swimming, bell-shaped individuals). Chrysaora feeds on small planktonic animals, such as arrowworms (Sagitta), ctenophores (comb jellies), and young polychaetes (e.g., Tomopteris). The prey is passed to the mouth by the marginal tentacles and mouth arms.
