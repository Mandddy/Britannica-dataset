Nechako River,  major tributary of the Fraser River, in central British Columbia, Canada. It originates at Kenney Dam and flows eastward for nearly 150 miles (240 km), draining the Nechako Plateau into the Fraser at Prince George, B.C. Stuart River, a 258-mile- (415-kilometre-) long tributary, joins the Nechako midway between Fort Fraser and Prince George, a stretch that is paralleled by the Canadian National Railway. Once a 287-mile- (462-kilometre-) long stream rising in Eutsuk Lake in the Coast Mountains of western British Columbia, the Nechako was bisected in 1952 by Kenney Dam as part of a colossal engineering project of the Aluminum Company of Canada, Ltd. The 340-foot (104-metre) dam created an 18,000,000-acre-foot (22,203,000,000-cubic-metre) reservoir (Lakes Ootsa, Whitesail, and Tahtsa), the overflow of which is tunneled westward through the Coast Mountains to Kemano, where it generates electricity for the giant Kitimat aluminum smelter.
