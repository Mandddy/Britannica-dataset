Bristlecone pine, (species Pinus longaeva and P. aristata), either of two species of small pine trees ranging from about 5 to 16 metres (15 to 50 feet) in height and belonging to the family Pinaceae. The species are native to the Rocky Mountains and other ranges of the southwestern United States, occurring usually at elevations above 1,700 metres (5,500 feet). The Great Basin bristlecone pine (P. longaeva) has the longest life-span of any conifer known. A stand of western bristlecone pine on Wheeler Peak in eastern Nevada is known to contain several trees over 3,000 years old, and one of them is thought to be about 5,000 years old. Of the Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines (P. aristata), the oldest known individual is estimated to be over 2,480 years old.
