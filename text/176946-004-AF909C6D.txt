Howard Hawks, in full Howard Winchester Hawks  (born May 30, 1896, Goshen, Indiana, U.S.—died December 26, 1977, Palm Springs, California) American motion-picture director who maintained a consistent personal style within the framework of traditional film genres in work that ranged from the 1920s to the ’70s. Although his films starred some of the American film industry’s most notable actors and were almost unremittingly popular, Hawks was long considered little more than a very competent journeyman before the critics-turned-filmmakers of the French New Wave began celebrating him as one of the quintessential Hollywood auteurs in the 1960s and ’70s.
Hawks made all of his 33 sound pictures without ever being under contract to a studio, although he relied almost entirely on cannily chosen studio talent. His signature was so distinctive that almost all his movies can be identified within moments as a Hawks film. Hawks was able to impose his style on nearly every viable genre that was in vogue during his long career—westerns, musicals, screwball comedies, war pictures, historical epics, romantic adventures, films noir, gangster sagas, and even science fiction. Many other directors were asked to do the same, but none enjoyed Hawks’s rate of success. He did not always manage to turn out a classic, but, arguably, he came close more often than any other American director, and his range significantly exceeded that of rival John Ford.
