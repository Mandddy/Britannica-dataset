Johannes Blaskowitz,  (born July 10, 1883, Peterswalde, Ger.—died Feb. 5, 1948, Nürnberg) German colonel-general, a tank specialist who commanded German military forces on several fronts during World War II and who deplored and protested Nazi atrocities.
A professional soldier who served in World War I, Blaskowitz rose rapidly during the Third Reich, acting as a field commander in the invasion of Austria and the Czech Sudetenland and becoming commander in chief of the Eighth Army in the Polish campaign. On Oct. 22, 1939, he was made military governor of the German occupying forces in Poland. There he directed two memoranda to higher authorities documenting cases of rape, murder, and looting of Jewish and Polish shops by the SS and other nonmilitary Nazi police and complaining that they operated outside the law and that he had no control over them. Adolf Hitler, infuriated at such statements, dismissed him from several army commands.
