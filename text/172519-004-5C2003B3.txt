Battle of Agincourt, (October 25, 1415), decisive victory of the English over the French in the Hundred Years’ War.
In pursuit of his claim to the French throne, Henry V of England and an army of about 11,000 men invaded Normandy in August 1415. They took Harfleur in September, but by then half their troops had been lost to disease and battle casualties. Henry decided to move northeast to Calais, an English enclave in France, whence his diminished forces could return to England. Large French forces under the constable Charles I d’Albret blocked his line of advance to the north, however.
