Taiyuan, Wade-Giles romanization T’ai-yüan,  city and capital of Shanxi sheng (province), China. One of the greatest industrial cities in China, it lies on the Fen River in the northern portion of the river’s fertile upper basin. Taiyuan commands the north-south route through Shanxi, as well as important natural lines of communication through the mountains to Hebei province in the east and, via Fenyang, to northern Shaanxi province in the west. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 1,970,304; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 2,913,000.
The city was originally the site of Jinyang, a strategic centre for the ancient states of Jin and Zhao. After the Qin conquest of Zhao and other states in 221 bce, it became the seat of the commandery (district under the control of a commander) of Taiyuan, which continued during the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce) and after. In the Dong (Eastern) Han period (25–220 ce), it became the capital of the province (zhou) of Bing. In the 6th century it was for a time a secondary capital of the Dong Wei and Bei (Northern) Qi states, growing into a large city and also becoming a centre of Buddhism. From that time until the middle of the Tang dynasty (618–907), the construction of the cave temples at Tianlong Mountain, southwest of the city, continued. The dynastic founder of the Tang began his conquest of the empire with Taiyuan as a base and using the support of its local aristocracy. It was periodically designated as the Tang’s northern capital and grew into a heavily fortified military base.
