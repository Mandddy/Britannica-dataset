Roberto Clemente, in full Roberto Clemente Walker  (born Aug. 18, 1934, Carolina, P.R.—died Dec. 31, 1972, San Juan) professional baseball player who was an idol in his native Puerto Rico and one of the first Latin American baseball stars in the United States (see also Sidebar: Latin Americans in Major League Baseball).
Clemente was originally signed to a professional contract by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1954. He was given a $10,000 bonus—very high by the standards of the times—but was sent to the minor leagues for the 1954 season. Because of a major league rule that stipulated that any player given a bonus of more that $4,000 had to be kept on the major league roster for his entire first season or be subject to a draft from other clubs, the Dodgers lost Clemente. Pittsburgh, which had finished last in the National League in 1954, selected him; Clemente made his major league debut on April 1, 1955, and spent his entire career with the Pittsburgh Pirates. For 18 seasons Clemente delighted fans with his hitting ability, daring base running, and strong throwing arm. His outstanding arm was perhaps his greatest physical asset. He won 12 Gold Gloves, the award given to the best fielding player in each position in the league. Baseball’s most talented outfielders are still compared to Clemente. He was also a very good hitter, winning four National League batting titles while compiling a lifetime average of .317. In 1972 Clemente got his 3,000th base hit on his very last at bat as a player. At the time, only 10 other players had reached this mark.
