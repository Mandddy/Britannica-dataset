Tyra Banks, in full Tyra Lynne Banks  (born December 4, 1973, Inglewood, California, U.S.) American fashion model and television personality best known as a face of the cosmetics company CoverGirl and the American lingerie, clothing, and cosmetics retailer Victoria’s Secret, as well as for her daily television talk show, The Tyra Banks Show (2005–10), and for hosting the modeling competition series America’s Next Top Model (2003–15).
Banks was raised in Inglewood, a suburb of Los Angeles, where she attended a local all-girls Catholic school. Her father was employed as a computer consultant, and her mother worked as a photographer. Banks started modeling at age 15 and, with the help of her mother, assembled a modeling portfolio. At age 17 she began seeking professional representation from local modeling agencies. Despite initial rejection—allegedly because of her “ethnic” look—Banks signed in 1990 for professional representation with Elite Model Management, one of the world’s top modeling agencies. Soon afterward she was featured in the leading teen magazine, Seventeen. After graduating from high school in 1991, Banks enrolled in Loyola Marymount University, but her plans changed when a French modeling scout offered her the opportunity to model high-fashion collections on the runways of Paris. Banks walked a record 25 shows in her first season and subsequently appeared on the cover of the Spanish edition of the leading fashion magazine Vogue, and she was soon christened the “new Naomi Campbell.”
