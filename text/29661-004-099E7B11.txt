Barylambda, extinct genus of unusual and aberrant mammals found as fossils in deposits in North America in the late Paleocene Epoch (58.7 to 55.8 million years ago). Barylambda was a relatively large animal, 2.5 metres (about 8 feet) long, with an unusually massive body and legs. The very thick tail possibly was used as a support, allowing the animal to raise itself on its hind legs. The skull was relatively small and short. The feet were short and broad, with five digits. Barylambda retained clavicles, or collarbones, a feature that is considered primitive in hoofed mammals. It is likely that Barylambda fed on plants that were rather soft and easily chewed. It was among the largest animals of its time.
