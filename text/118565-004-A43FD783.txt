John R. Pope, in full John Russell Pope   (born April 24, 1874, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Aug. 27, 1937, New York) American architect whose most important design was the National Gallery of Art (completed in 1941 and since 1978 known as the West Building of the National Gallery) in Washington, D.C.
Trained at the American Academy at Rome and later at the École des Beaux-Arts (Paris), Pope became a leading exponent of academic eclecticism—the duplication of historic architectural styles through painstaking scholarship. Following his studies, Pope began practice in New York City in 1900. His designs included the Scottish Rite Temple in Washington, D.C., the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Richmond, Va., Terminal Station.
