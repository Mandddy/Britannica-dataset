Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, baron de Cloots, pseudonym Anacharsis Cloots  (born June 24, 1755, near Kleve, Brandenburg [Germany]—died March 24, 1794, Paris, France) radical democrat of the French Revolution who became a leading exponent of French expansionism in Europe.
Born into a noble Prussian family of Dutch origin, Cloots went to Paris in 1776 and took part in the compilation of Denis Diderot’s Encyclopédie. He left France in 1784, traveled throughout Europe, and returned to Paris at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789. He quickly became an ardent democrat and a member of the Jacobin Club. As head of a delegation of 36 foreigners (his self-proclaimed “embassy of the human race”), he addressed the revolutionary National Assembly on June 17, 1791, declaring that the whole world adhered to the democratic ideals of the Revolution. He henceforth titled himself “The Orator of Mankind” and adopted the pseudonym “Anacharsis.”
