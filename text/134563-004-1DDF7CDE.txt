Curtis E. LeMay,  (born Nov. 15, 1906, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.—died  Oct. 1, 1990, March Air Force Base, Calif.) U.S. Air Force officer whose expertise in strategic bombardment techniques was important during World War II and afterward.
Entering the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1928, LeMay advanced to the position of bombardment group commander by 1942. Flying with the 8th Air Force from England (1942–44), he became known for his development of advanced bomber tactics, including pattern bombing and the combat box formation. After commanding B-29s in India and China (1944), LeMay took over the 21st Bomber Command in the Mariana Islands (January 1945); in that post he planned and originated the low-altitude incendiary-bombing tactics that burned out parts of Tokyo and a number of other Japanese cities in an effort to force a surrender before the Allied invasion of Japan, which was planned for the end of that year.
