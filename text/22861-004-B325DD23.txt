Bushtit (Psaltriparus minimus), gray bird of western North America, belonging to the songbird family Aegithalidae (order Passeriformes). The common bushtit is 11 cm (4.5 inches) long and ranges from British Columbia to Guatemala. This tiny, drab bird is common in oak scrub, chaparral, piñon, and juniper woodlands, as well as in wooded suburbs and parks of the West. “Black-eared” forms used to be regarded as a separate species (P. melanotis) but are now considered a subspecies. Bands of bushtits forage busily for tiny insects, especially leafhoppers, aphids, and scale insects, in dryland scrub. They also eat seeds and berries. Their call note is a lisping, ticking sound. For their two broods per year, these birds make pouchlike nests out of spiderwebs, mosses, lichens, and rootlets and line them with animal hair, plant down, and feathers. The parents cooperate in raising the five to seven young in each clutch and may both sleep in the nest at night.
