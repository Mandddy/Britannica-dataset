Taxol, organic compound with a complex multi-ring molecule that occurs in the bark of Pacific yew trees (Taxus brevifolia). It is active against certain cancers of the lung, ovary, breast, head, and neck, disrupting cell division and interfering with separation of the nuclear chromosomes. A semisynthetic process to make it from yew needles and twigs eliminated the prospect of widespread destruction of yew forests, and total synthesis methods were later developed.
