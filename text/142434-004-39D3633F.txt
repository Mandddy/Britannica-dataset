Spray gun, painting tool using compressed air from a nozzle to atomize a liquid into a controlled pattern. The spray nozzle operates by impinging high-velocity turbulent air on the surface of filaments or films of liquid, causing them to collapse to droplets with a wide range of sizes.
The spray gun, developed originally from the airbrush, is used for less delicate work, such as applying lacquers, paints, varnishes, shellac, and other finishes to manufactured articles. Spray guns are available as stationary equipment for painting automobiles, furniture, and appliances. Portable equipment is used for maintenance painting of both old and new construction. The finishes may be supplied to the gun by gravity from an overhead reservoir (for low-viscosity lacquers), by suction from a container that is part of the spray gun (for small work and work in which frequent colour changes occur), or by pressure in a mass-production operation. Adequate supplies of dry air are provided by auxiliary equipment.
