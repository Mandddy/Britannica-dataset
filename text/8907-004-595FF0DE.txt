Uppsala University, Swedish Uppsala Universitet,  state-sponsored coeducational university at Uppsala, the oldest institution of higher learning in Sweden. It was founded in 1477 but closed in 1510 because of the religious disputes of the time. It was reopened in 1595 with faculties of theology and philosophy, and in 1624 King Gustav II Adolf granted it large landed estates, thus providing the school’s future financial basis. The most famous figure associated with the university was the 18th-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus.
The university’s current faculties include theology, law, medicine, arts, languages, pharmacy, social sciences, educational sciences, mathematics, computer science, physics, technology, earth science, and chemistry. The university’s library, the Carolina Rediviva, is one of Sweden’s largest and contains the illuminated manuscript Codex Argenteus, which is the only extant manuscript of Bishop Ulfilas’s 4th-century translation of the Gospels into the Gothic language. The main university building (1887) has a large art collection.
