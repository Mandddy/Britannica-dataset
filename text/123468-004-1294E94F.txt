Pierre-Paul, Baron Riquet de Bonrepos,  (born 1604, Béziers, France—died Oct. 1, 1680, Toulouse) French public official and self-made engineer who constructed the epochal 240-km (149-mile) Midi Canal (also called the Languedoc Canal) connecting the Garonne River to the Aude River, thus linking the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. The canal has been called the greatest civil engineering project in Europe from Roman times to the 19th century.
A salt tax collector under Louis XIV, Riquet interested himself in the long-discussed problem of constructing a navigable waterway to provide a shortcut from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean. In 1662 he laid a proposal before Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV’s finance minister. Through Colbert’s influence, Riquet obtained from the king and the province of Languedoc loans that permitted him to carry out the work, which required many locks, a reservoir to provide water for the summit section during the dry season, and the famous Malpas Tunnel. Riquet became the first engineer to employ an explosive (black powder) for blasting rock, which he used on the section near Capestang. Worn out by his labours, he died while executing the final section of canal down to the port of Cette (modern Sète) at the Mediterranean terminus. The canal opened the following year (1681).
