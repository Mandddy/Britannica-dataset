Kuna, also spelled Cuna,  Chibchan-speaking Indian people who once occupied the central region of what is now Panama and the neighbouring San Blas Islands and who still survive in marginal areas.
In the 16th century the Kuna were an important group, living in federated villages under chiefs, who had considerable power, and engaging in warfare with each other and with neighbouring tribes. Agriculture was primarily based on slash-and-burn techniques, and there was extensive trade, mainly by canoe along the coast. They had a well-developed class system, with captives generally being enslaved. Important chiefs were carried in hammocks; their bodies were preserved after death and buried in large graves with their wives and retainers. Metallurgy was well developed, and numerous gold ornaments have been found in the graves, along with fine ceramics and ornaments of shell.
