Qian Xuesen, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’ien Hsüeh-sen, also spelled Tsien Hsue-shen  (born December 11, 1911, Shanghai, China—died October 31, 2009, Beijing) Chinese engineer and research scientist widely recognized as the “father of Chinese aerospace” for his role in establishing China’s ballistic missile program.
Qian was the only child of an aristocratic Hangzhou family whose recorded lineage of more than a thousand years has been traced to Qian Liu (852–932), the founder of the Wu-Yue kingdom. His grandparents were wealthy merchants. His father, Qian Jiachi, was an educational reformer and administrator, and his mother, Zhang Lanjuan, studied the Confucian classics. Qian’s family history engendered powerful emotional connections to a transforming Chinese culture that would define Qian’s professional life and make him an icon of 20th-century China.
