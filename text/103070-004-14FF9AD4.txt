Alanis Morissette, in full Alanis Nadine Morissette  (born June 1, 1974, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) Canadian musician known for her confessional lyrics and a layered rock-influenced sound. Her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill established her as one of alternative rock’s foremost female vocalists of the 1990s.
Morissette began studying piano at age six and composing at seven; she wrote her first songs at nine. By age 10 she was acting in You Can’t Do That on Television, a series on the children’s television network Nickelodeon. She used her earnings from that show to cut her first single. At age 14 Morissette signed a song-publishing deal that led to two dance-pop albums, Alanis (1991), which sold at least 100,000 copies and earned her Canada’s Juno Award for most promising female vocalist of the year, and Now Is the Time (1992), which sold more than 50,000 copies.
