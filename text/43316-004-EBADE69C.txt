Maqāmah, (
        Arabic: “assembly”) Arabic literary genre in which entertaining anecdotes, often about rogues, mountebanks, and beggars, written in an elegant, rhymed prose (sajʿ), are presented in a dramatic or narrative context most suitable for the display of the author’s eloquence, wit, and erudition.
The first collection of such writings, which make no pretense of being factual, was the Maqāmāt of al-Hamadhānī (d. 1008). It consists mainly of picaresque stories in alternating prose and verse woven round two imaginary characters. The genre was revived and finally established in the 11th century by al-Ḥarīrī of Basra (Iraq), whose Maqāmāt, closely imitating al-Hamadhānī’s, is regarded as a masterpiece of literary style and learning.
