Francesco Saverio Nitti,  (born July 19, 1868, Melfi, Italy—died  Feb. 20, 1953, Rome) Italian statesman who was prime minister for a critical year after World War I.
After a career as a journalist and professor of economics, Nitti was elected deputy in 1904. A Left Liberal, he served as minister of agriculture, industry, and commerce in 1911–14 and as minister of the treasury in 1917–19. He succeeded Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, the wartime prime minister, in June 1919, in the midst of foreign and domestic crises involving Italian territorial claims disputed by other Allied countries and the economic and fiscal problems created by the war and demobilization. Nitti’s adoption of the system of proportional representation (Aug. 15, 1919) resulted in large increases in the number of deputies elected by the Socialists (156) and the Christian Democrats, or Popolari (100), but he did not succeed in conciliating these parties, and an epidemic of strikes by industrial workers and disorders fomented by the new Fascist Party of Benito Mussolini undermined not only Nitti’s government but the processes of democratic government itself. Nitti resigned on June 9, 1920. He was reelected to parliament in 1921 and served until 1924 but did not enter his name in the election of that year held by the new Fascist regime. For several years he remained in exile in France, devoting himself to writing.
