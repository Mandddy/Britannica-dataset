Garcilaso de la Vega,  (born 1503, Toledo, Spain—died Oct. 14, 1536, Nice, duchy of Savoy [now in France]) the first major poet in the Golden Age of Spanish literature (c. 1500–1650).
Garcilaso was born into an aristocratic family that had been prominent in Spanish letters and politics for several centuries. Entering court life at an early age, he distinguished himself as a soldier, serving Emperor Charles V in Rhodes, Tunis, and Pavia. After a brief imprisonment in 1532 for conspiring to marry his brother’s son to a prominent lady-in-waiting against the emperor’s wishes, he was released into the service of the viceroy, the Marqués de Villafranca. Serving under the viceroy in southern France, he was mortally wounded in an assault on a fortified position and died several days later.
