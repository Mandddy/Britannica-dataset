La Venta,  ancient Olmec settlement, located near the border of modern Tabasco and Veracruz states, on the gulf coast of Mexico. La Venta was originally built on an island in the Tonalá River; now it is part of a large swamp. After petroleum was found there, many of the artifacts were moved to an archaeological park on the outskirts of the city of Villahermosa, some 80 miles (129 km) to the west.
Between about 800 and 400 bc La Venta was the most important settlement in Mesoamerica. All its major structures are set on an axis 8° west of north; they were probably originally aligned with some star or constellation. The site is dominated by a 100-foot- (30-metre-) high clay mound shaped like a fluted cone, which some archaeologists believe represents a volcano. North of this is a plaza and a ceremonial enclosure containing a number of tombs. There were three mosaic pavements representing jaguar masks, each measuring about 15 by 20 feet (4.5 by 6 m); these were deliberately buried soon after completion. In addition, there were numerous carved basalt monuments, notably colossal heads weighing some 18 tons. The basalt was quarried about 80 miles west of La Venta. Smaller artifacts include jade ornaments and polished iron-ore mirrors.
