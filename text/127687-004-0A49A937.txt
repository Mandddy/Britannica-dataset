Robert Baldwin,  (born May 12, 1804, York, Upper Canada [now Toronto, Ontario, Canada]—died December 9, 1858, Toronto) statesman who was joint leader with Louis-Hippolyte LaFontaine (as the attorneys general of Canada West and East, respectively) of the first and second Reform administrations in the Province of Canada, which established the principle of responsible, or cabinet, government in Canada.
Called to the bar in 1825, Baldwin began his political career as a member (1829–30) of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for York. In 1836 he served briefly on the Executive Council of Upper Canada and supported the union of Canada, condemning the Rebellion of 1837. He served (1840) on the Executive Council under Charles Poulett Thomson (later Baron Sydenham) but resigned, joining the opposition. In 1842, under the governor-generalship of Sir Charles Bagot, Baldwin and LaFontaine formed a Reform administration for the newly constituted Province of Canada, a merger of Lower Canada (renamed Canada East; now Quebec) and Upper Canada (Canada West; now Ontario). They held office until Bagot’s successor, Sir Charles Metcalfe, caused several ministers to resign. In the 1843 election the governor-generalship was narrowly sustained, but in 1848 the Reformers were returned to power. Under James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, Baldwin and LaFontaine saw the realization of their aim of responsible government and the enactment of other reforms, including municipal self-government for Canada West and freeing of the University of Toronto from sectarian control.
