Sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekei), the most aquatic antelope, with elongated, splayed hooves and flexible foot joints that enable it to traverse boggy ground. Though common, even abundant, in African swamps and permanent marshes, the sitatunga is also one of the most secretive and least known of Africa’s large fauna. It is a member of the spiral-horned antelope tribe, Tragelaphini (family Bovidae), which also includes the nyala and kudu.
Female sitatungas stand 75–90 cm (30–35 inches) tall and weigh 40–85 kg (90–185 pounds); males stand 88–125 cm (35–49 inches) tall and weigh 70–125 kg (150–275 pounds). Both sexes have a woolly, bright rufous coat that is marked with 8–10 white stripes, spots on flanks and cheeks, and patches on neck and legs; they also have a white-to-brown spinal crest. Sitatungas develop shaggy, water-repellent pelage, which is brown to chestnut in females and gray-brown to chocolate-brown in males, that partially obscures the markings; coloration varies individually and regionally, with southern populations being the least colourful. Only males have horns, which are 45–90 cm (18–35 inches) long with one to one and a half turns. The sitatunga’s range is centred on rivers and swamps in the rainforest of the Congo basin. Isolated populations occur in wetlands that afford cover in the form of papyrus, reeds, bulrushes, or sedges on the borders of major rivers and lakes in sub-Saharan Africa.
