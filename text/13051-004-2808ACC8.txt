Sébastien-Roch Nicolas Chamfort,  (born June 1740?, Clermont, France—died April 13, 1794, Paris) French playwright and conversationalist, famous for his wit, whose maxims became popular bywords during the French Revolution.
Soon after his birth—the date of which differs between sources—Chamfort was adopted by a grocer and his wife. He later was educated as a free scholar and then supported by a worldly Parisian society that appreciated his conversational genius. His comedies La Jeune Indienne (produced 1764; “The Young Indian Girl”) and Le Marchand de Smyrne (produced 1770; “The Merchant of Smyrna”) and a tragedy, Mustapha et Zéangir (produced 1776), established his reputation. Eloge de Molière (1769) won him entry into the French Academy, but he later attacked academies with his Discours sur les Académies (1791).
