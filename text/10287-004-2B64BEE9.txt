Leaf roller moth, also called Bell Moth,  any member of the worldwide insect family Tortricidae (order Lepidoptera), named for the characteristic leaf rolling habit of the larvae. The name bell moth arises from the shape of the adultâ€™s folded, squarish forewings. These moths are characterized by their stout bodies, small antennae, reduced mouthparts, and broad, slightly fringed wings that can expand to 25 mm (1 inch).
The larvae usually feed from nests made of rolled leaves. Many species (e.g., those of Archips, Cacoecia) are gregarious, congregating and constructing large communal nests of silk, twigs, and leaves. The destructive larval tortricids include the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), one of the most destructive North American pests. It attacks evergreens, feeding on needles and pollen, and can completely defoliate spruce and related trees, causing much loss for the lumber industry. Other species are pests of evergreen and deciduous trees: the European oak roller, or pea-green, moth (Tortrix viridana) and the North American ugly-nest caterpillar (Archips cerasivoranus).
