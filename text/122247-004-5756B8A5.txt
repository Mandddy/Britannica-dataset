New York Botanical Garden, one of the leading centres of botanical research and floristics in the United States. The 250-acre (101-hectare) garden, located in Bronx Park, New York City, has a plant collection consisting of about 12,000 species from almost every part of the world. Many of the specimens are displayed throughout the year in a conservatory that covers nearly 1 acre (0.5 hectare). Outdoor exhibits include a pristine 40-acre woodland, a rock garden, and a garden of native plants, as well as special collections of conifers, lilacs, and magnolias. Also located at the garden is one of the largest botanical libraries in the country and an herbarium of 5,700,000 dried reference specimens. Varied educational programs, some involving the use of these facilities, are offered to the public.
The New York Botanical Garden was founded in 1891, largely through the efforts of Nathaniel Lord Britton, a professor of botany at Columbia University. It was opened to the public in 1900. As the gardenâ€™s first director, Britton initiated a program of botanical exploration that continues today, with studies being conducted in South America, especially the rainforests of the Atlantic Coast of Brazil and of the foothills of the Andes Mountains, and occasionally in other continents. In 1971 the garden acquired a large tract of land 70 miles (110 km) north of the city, for the establishment of the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum. The arboretum site covers 1,924 acres (778 hectares).
