Volkhov River,  also spelled Volchov, Russian Reka Volkhov,  river, northwestern Russia. It is the major outlet for Lake Ilmen, whence it flows past Novgorod and directly north-northeast into Lake Ladoga across a level, swampy basin. The river is 139 miles (224 km) long and drains a basin of 31,000 square miles (80,200 square km). It is frozen from mid-November to mid-April. At the town of Volkhov the first hydroelectric station in the Soviet Union was built in 1926. The Volkhov, in early times part of the important Baltic Seaâ€“Black Sea trade route, is navigable only by small craft.
