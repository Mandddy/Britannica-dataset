Phoebe, any of three species of New World birds of the family Tyrannidae (order Passeriformes). In North America the best-known species is the Eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), 18 cm (7.5 inches) long, plain brownish gray above and paler below. Its call is a brisk “fee-bee” uttered over and over. It makes a mossy nest, strengthened with mud, on a ledge, often under a bridge. In the open country of western North America is Say’s phoebe (S. saya), a slightly larger bird with buff-hued underparts. The most widely distributed is the black phoebe (S. nigricans), which occurs near water from the southwestern United States to Argentina. Measuring 16 cm (6.3 inches) long, S. nigricans is slightly smaller than S. phoebe, and it is dark above with a contrasting white belly. All phoebes have the habit of twitching their tails when perching.
