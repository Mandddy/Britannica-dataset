WWF, in full World Wide Fund for Nature,  international organization committed to conservation of the environment. In North America it is called the World Wildlife Fund.
In 1960 a group of British naturalists—most notably biologist Sir Julian Huxley, artist and conservationist Peter Scott, and ornithologists Guy Mountfort and Max Nicholson—led an effort to establish an organization that protected endangered species and their habitats. The following year the World Wildlife Fund was founded; the international name was subsequently changed to World Wide Fund for Nature in 1989, although in the United States and Canada it retained the founding name. The organization’s distinctive panda logo was created by Scott. In the face of growing environmental threats over the ensuing years, the WWF’s activities expanded in scope. Today its mission statement is threefold: to conserve the world’s biological diversity, to ensure that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable, and to promote the reduction of pollution and of wasteful consumption. The organization has long included both conservationists and businesspeople with the intention of combining solid scientific data with well-managed action. It also seeks cooperation between nongovernmental organizations, local governments, and local populations. The WWF works closely with the World Conservation Union and has formed partnerships with the United Nations, the World Bank, and the European Union.
