Beyoncé, in full Beyoncé Giselle Knowles  (born September 4, 1981, Houston, Texas, U.S.) American singer-songwriter and actress who achieved fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of the R&amp;B group Destiny’s Child and then launched a successful solo career.
At age nine Beyoncé formed the singing-rapping girl group Destiny’s Child (originally called Girl’s Tyme) in 1990 with childhood friends. In 1992 the group lost on the Star Search television talent show, and three years later it was dropped from a recording contract before an album had been released. In 1997 Destiny’s Child’s fortunes reversed with a Columbia recording contract and then an eponymous debut album that yielded the hit single “No, No, No Part 2.” Their follow-up album, The Writing’s on the Wall (1999), earned the group two Grammy Awards and sold more than eight million copies in the United States. Survivor (2001), the group’s third album, reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 chart.
