Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero,  (born March 16, 1585, Amsterdam, Neth.—died  Aug. 23, 1618, Amsterdam) poet and playwright who wrote folk songs, farces, and comedies treating cosmopolitan Dutch life.
The conflict between Bredero’s experiences of the medieval, full-blooded life of the backstreets of Amsterdam and the sophistication of the Renaissance intelligentsia was most evident in his earliest poetry, which is collected in Groot Liedt-Boeck (1622; “Great Songbook”). The humorous poems revealed the same power of observation for which some critics have praised the painters Jan Steen and Adriaen van Ostade. The sensuality of the amorous songs and sonnets contrasts with the sincerity and often the remorse of the devotional poetry.
