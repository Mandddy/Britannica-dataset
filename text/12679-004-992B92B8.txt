Peter Cornelius,  (born Dec. 24, 1824, Mainz, Hesse-Darmstadt [Germany]—died  Oct. 26, 1874, Mainz, Ger.) German composer and author, known for his comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad (The Barber of Bagdad).
The son of an actor and an actress, he acted at Mainz and at Wiesbaden in his youth. In 1845 he studied composition and was later music critic for two Berlin journals. From 1853 to 1858 he lived at Weimar in the circle of Franz Liszt and the Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein and translated articles by Liszt and Hector Berlioz for the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik. In 1857 he began Der Barbier von Bagdad, on a libretto of his own based on The Thousand and One Nights. It was conducted by Liszt at Weimar in 1858 but was a failure and led to Liszt’s resignation from the Weimar opera. It was successfully revived in 1884 in a reorchestrated version by Felix Mottl. From 1859 to 1864 Cornelius lived in Vienna, where he became a friend of Richard Wagner. In 1865 he accompanied Wagner to Munich and was reader to King Louis (Ludwig) II of Bavaria and professor at the royal school of music. He wrote two other operas, Der Cid (1865; libretto adapted by him from the play by Pierre Corneille) and Gunlöd (libretto adapted from the Edda), which was completed after his death by Carl Hoffbauer and Eduard Lassen and produced in 1891.
