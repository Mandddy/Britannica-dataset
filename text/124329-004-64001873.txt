Javier Bardem, in full Javier Ángel Encinas Bardem  (born March 1, 1969, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain) charismatic and versatile Spanish actor who first came to prominence in the 1990s.
Bardem, who was born into a family of actors and filmmakers, appeared in his first professional role at age five. After briefly studying painting in Madrid, he concentrated on an acting career. In 1992 he received much attention—especially from women—for his work in Jamón, jamón, in which he played an underwear model hired to romance a factory worker. Three years later he proved he was more than a sex symbol by winning a Goya Award (Spain’s national film award) for best supporting actor for his performance as a drug addict in Días contados (1994; Running Out of Time). In Boca a boca (1995; Mouth to Mouth) he garnered laughs and another Goya Award as an aspiring actor who falls in love with a customer while working for a telephone-sex company. Bardem later appeared as a wheelchair-bound policeman in Pedro Almodóvar’s Carne trémula (1997; Live Flesh).
