Jaunting car, also called jaunty car, or sidecar,  two-wheeled, open vehicle, popular in Ireland from the early 19th century. It was unusual in having lengthwise, back-to-back or face-to-face passenger seats. The light, horse-drawn cart carried four passengers (although the earliest versions carried more). It usually had a narrow, forward-facing driverâ€™s seat.
