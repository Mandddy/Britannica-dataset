Gerrit Smith,  (born March 6, 1797, Utica, New York, U.S.â€”died  December 28, 1874, New York, New York) American reformer and philanthropist who provided financial backing for the antislavery crusader John Brown.
Smith was born into a wealthy family. In about 1828 he became an active worker in the cause of temperance, and in his home village, Peterboro, he built one of the first temperance hotels in the country. He became an abolitionist in 1835, after witnessing the disruption of an antislavery meeting by a mob in Utica. In 1840 he took a leading part in the organization of the antislavery Liberty Party, and in 1848 and 1852 he was nominated for the presidency by the remnant of this organization that had not been absorbed by the Free Soil Party. In 1852 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as an independent. At the end of the first session in 1854 he resigned his seat.
