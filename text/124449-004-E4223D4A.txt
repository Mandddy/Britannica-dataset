Gandak River, also called Narayani River,  river in central Nepal and northern India. It is formed by the union of the Kali and Trisuli rivers, which rise in the Great Himalaya Range in Nepal; from this junction to the Indian border the river is called the Narayani. It flows southwest into India and then turns southeast along the Uttar Pradesh–Bihar state border and across the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It enters the Ganges (Ganga) River opposite Patna after a winding course of 475 miles (765 km). The Burhi (“Old”) Gandak flows parallel to and east of the Gandak River in an old channel. It joins the Ganges northeast of Munger.
