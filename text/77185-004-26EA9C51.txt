The Fortune Cookie, American screwball comedy film, released in 1966, that featured the first teaming of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.
Sports cameraman Harry Hinkle (played by Lemmon) is accidentally injured on the field during a football game. Although not seriously hurt, he is browbeaten by his shyster lawyer and brother-in-law, Willie Gingrich (Matthau), into feigning serious injury in order to collect an insurance payment. The plan goes awry when investigators suspect a fraud, and Hinkle has to pretend that he is a virtual invalid.
