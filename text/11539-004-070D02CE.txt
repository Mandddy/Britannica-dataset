Charles Gerhardt, in full Charles-Frédéric Gerhardt  (born Aug. 21, 1816, Strasbourg, France—died Aug. 19, 1856, Strasbourg) French chemist who was an important precursor of the German chemist August Kekule and his structural organic chemistry.
Gerhardt’s Swiss-born father, Samuel Gerhardt, initially worked in a bank. In 1825 Samuel Gerhardt became a manufacturer of white lead but had little understanding of the technical side of his factory, so in 1831 young Gerhardt was sent to learn chemistry at Karlsruhe Polytechnic in Germany. Afterward he went to a business school in Leipzig, where, however, he preferred to continue his chemical studies. After an unsuccessful attempt to work for his father, he resumed chemical studies with Justus Liebig at the University of Giessen in Germany from 1836 to 1837. A final attempt at reconciliation with his father failed, and Gerhardt left in 1838 to study chemistry under Jean-Baptiste-André Dumas at the University of Paris, from which he received a doctorate in 1841. Gerhardt’s chemical training provided perhaps the best that both Germany and France had to offer, and it put him in an almost unique intermediary position in an age of strong rivalries between their national schools of chemistry. His own strength of character (or, as critics would say, his argumentativeness) determined that he would make up his own mind on the questions of the day.
