Ventifact,  stone that has received one or more highly polished, flattened facets as a result of erosion by windblown sand. The facets are cut in sequence and correlate with the dominant wind direction. As one surface is cut, the stone may become out of balance and may turn to expose another surface to the wind. A ventifact that has been eroded to three curved facets is called a dreikanter. Ventifacts are produced under arid conditions and are generally formed from hard, fine-grained rocks such as obsidian, chert, or quartzite.
