Highland climate, major climate type often added to the Köppen classification, although it was not part of German botanist-climatologist Wladimir Köppen’s original or revised systems. It contains all highland areas not easily categorized by other climate types. It is abbreviated H in the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system.
The major highland regions of the world (the Cascades, Sierra Nevadas, and Rockies of North America, the Andes of South America, the Himalayas and adjacent ranges and the Plateau of Tibet of Asia, the eastern highlands of Africa, and the central portions of Borneo and New Guinea) cannot be classified realistically at this scale of consideration, since the effects of altitude and relief give rise to myriad mesoclimates and microclimates. This diversity over short horizontal distances is unmappable at the continental scale. Very little of a universal nature can be written about such mountain areas except to note that, as a rough approximation, they tend to resemble cooler, wetter versions of the climates of nearby lowlands in terms of their annual temperature ranges and seasonality of precipitation. Otherwise, only the most general characteristics may be noted.
