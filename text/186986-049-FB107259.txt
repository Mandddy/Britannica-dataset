Calorie, a unit of energy or heat variously defined. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of heat required at a pressure of 1 standard atmosphere to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1° Celsius. Since 1925 this calorie has been defined in terms of the joule, the definition since 1948 being that one calorie is equal to approximately 4.2 joules. Because the quantity of heat represented by the calorie is known to differ at different temperatures (by as much as 1 percent), it has consequently been necessary to define the temperature at which the specific heat of water is to be taken as 1 calorie. Thus the “15° calorie” (also called the gram-calorie, or small calorie) was defined as the amount of heat that will raise the temperature of 1 gram of water from 14.5° to 15.5° C—equal to 4.1855 joules. Other less common definitions in this series are the 20° calorie (4.18190 joules) from 19.5° to 20.5° C; and the mean calorie (4.19002 joules) defined as 1/100 of the heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water from 0° to 100° C.
Another calorie, a unit of heat energy, is the International Table calorie (IT calorie), originally defined as 1/860 international watt-hour. It is equal to 4.1868 joules and is used in engineering steam tables.
