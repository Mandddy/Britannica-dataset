Harry James, in full Harry Haag James  (born March 15, 1916, Albany, Ga., U.S.—died  July 5, 1983, Las Vegas, Nev.) American jazz musician and bandleader, and one of the most popular and dynamic trumpet players of the big band era.
The son of circus performers, James learned to play drums at age 4 and the trumpet at 8; when he was 12 he led one of the circus bands. As a young man he played with various orchestras, including a stint with Ben Pollack in 1935–36. He became a member of Benny Goodman’s orchestra in December 1936. In that band he joined trumpeters Ziggy Elman and Chris Griffin to form the “powerhouse trio,” one of the most celebrated big band trumpet sections in jazz history. James was the primary soloist in the section and soared to fame with his solo turns on such songs as “Ridin’ High,” “Sing, Sing, Sing,” and “One o’Clock Jump.” He also composed and arranged “Life Goes to a Party,” a tune that was regarded as one of the Goodman band’s best swing numbers.
