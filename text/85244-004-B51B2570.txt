Alicia Keys, original name Alicia Augello Cook  (born January 25, 1981, New York, New York, U.S.) American singer-songwriter, pianist, and actress, who achieved enormous success in the early 2000s with her blend of R&amp;B and soul music.
Keys began performing at age four and playing piano at age seven, concentrating on classical music and jazz. At age 14 she began composing, and two years later she graduated as valedictorian from the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan. Keys’s compositions showed modern influences but were rooted in the sounds of earlier soul artists, including Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. After attracting the attention of record mogul Clive Davis, she signed to his Arista Records in 1998, and, when Davis formed J Records in 2000, she was one of the first artists to sign with the new label. In 2001 Keys released Songs in A Minor, a hugely successful debut album that featured a number one hit with “Fallin’” and that went on to sell more than 10 million copies worldwide. She won five Grammy Awards in 2002, including those for song of the year and best new artist.
