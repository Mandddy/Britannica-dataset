Panamanian golden toad (Atelopus zeteki), also called Panamanian golden frog,  small, bright yellow toad, often with a few black spots or blotches, that is found at moderate elevations in the central part of Panama. Considered to be one of the most beautiful frogs in Panama, where it is endangered and legally protected, the golden toad has attracted so much attention that it has become a national symbol.
The Panamanian golden toadâ€™s skin contains a potent water-soluble toxin called zetekitoxin, which affects nerve cells and protects the toad from most predators. However, if minor precautions are taken, these toads can be safely handled.
