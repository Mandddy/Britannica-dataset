Clarence Birdseye,  (born December 9, 1886, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 7, 1956, New York) American businessman and inventor best known for developing a process for freezing foods in small packages suitable for retailing.
After working as a government naturalist, Birdseye went to Labrador as a fur trader in 1912 and again in 1916. There the people often froze food in the winter because of the difficulty of obtaining fresh food; this solution to their problem spurred Birdseye’s imagination.
