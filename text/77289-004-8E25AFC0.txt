Joseph L. Mankiewicz, in full Joseph Leo Mankiewicz  (born February 11, 1909, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died February 5, 1993, Mount Kisco, New York) American producer, director, and screenwriter known for his witty, literary, urbane dialogue and memorable characters. He worked with many of Hollywood’s major stars and earned the reputation of being a talented actor’s director, guiding such performers as Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, and Laurence Olivier to some of their most-memorable screen performances.
Before he was 20, Mankiewicz served as a foreign correspondent in Berlin for the Chicago Tribune. While in Germany, he worked for UFA as an English translator of subtitles for German-made films. In 1929 his older brother, Herman J. Mankiewicz, a successful screenwriter, introduced the younger Mankiewicz to Hollywood, where he got his start composing subtitles for silent versions of Paramount talkies, which were distributed to theatres not yet equipped for sound. Mankiewicz soon displayed his gift for comedy, writing material for comic actors Jack Oakie and W.C. Fields. His early writing credits include The Mysterious Dr. Fu Manchu (1929); Skippy (1931), a family comedy that earned him an Academy Award nomination; If I Had a Million (1932), for which he coined Field’s famous phrase “my little chickadee”; and Million Dollar Legs (1932).
