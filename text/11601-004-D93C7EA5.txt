Mary Garden,  (born Feb. 20, 1874, Aberdeen, Scot.—died  Jan. 3, 1967, Aberdeen) soprano famous for her vivid operatic portrayals. She was noted for her acting as well as her singing and was an important figure in American opera.
Garden went to the United States from Scotland with her parents when she was seven and began studying violin and piano and receiving voice lessons at an early age. In 1897 she traveled to Paris to continue her voice training. A soprano, she made her public debut there in April 1900 in Gustave Charpentier’s Louise at the Opéra-Comique when, as understudy, she filled in for the stricken regular soprano. She was an immediate success and subsequently sang in La traviata and other operas. In April 1902 she was chosen by Claude Debussy to sing the female lead in the premiere of his Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique, and her interpretation of that role became her most famous.
