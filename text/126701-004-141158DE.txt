University of St. Andrews, oldest university in Scotland, officially founded in 1413, located in Fife region. The university buildings, many of which date from the Middle Ages, include St. Salvator’s College (1450), St. Leonard’s College (1512), and the University Library, refounded by James VI in 1612. A third college, St. Mary’s (1537), has been limited (since 1579) to the teaching of theology. In 1747 St. Salvator’s and St. Leonard’s were merged. Among the famous teachers associated with St. Andrews in the 20th century was the zoologist Sir D’Arcy Thompson.
