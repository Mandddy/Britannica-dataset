John Wood the Elder, byname Wood of Bath  (baptized Aug. 26, 1704, Bath, Somerset, Eng.—died May 23, 1754, Bath) English architect and town planner who established the physical character of the resort city of Bath. Wood the Elder transformed Bath by adapting the town layout to a sort of Roman plan, emphasizing the processional aspect of social life during the period. Though some of his individual buildings were noteworthy exercises in Palladianism (a kind of 16th-century Italian Renaissance classicism), he was most highly regarded for his planning of streets and groups of houses as visual units.
After helping to build the Cavendish-Harley housing estate in London, Wood designed his first important “townscapes” in Bath, the North and South Parades (1728). These were followed by Queen Square (1735), Prior Park (1735–48), the Royal Mineral Water Hospital (1738), the Circus (completed in 1764, after his death, by his son John Wood the Younger), and the Royal Crescent (1767–75; executed by the younger Wood from his father’s design). Later a school, Prior Park was originally the residence of Ralph Allen, Wood’s chief patron and the principal supplier of Bath building stone (an oolitic limestone).
