 Frederick John Robinson, 1st earl of Ripon,  (born Nov. 1, 1782, London, Eng.—died  Jan. 28, 1859, Putney, Surrey) prime minister of Great Britain from August 1827 to January 1828. He received from the radical journalist William Cobbett the sardonic nicknames “Prosperity Robinson” (for his unwarranted optimism on the eve of the 1825 economic crisis) and “Goody Goderich.”
Educated at Harrow and Cambridge, he began his political career as private secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland and rose to be president of the Board of Trade (1818–23) and chancellor of the Exchequer (1823–27). In George Canning’s ministry (April–August 1827) he was secretary for war and the colonies and leader of the House of Lords. He succeeded Canning as prime minister but was unsuited to the position and was dismissed. In the ministry (1831–34) of Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, he was again secretary for war and the colonies and lord privy seal. He was created Earl of Ripon in 1833. In Sir Robert Peel’s second ministry he was president of the Board of Trade (September 1841–May 1843) and president of the India Board (May 1843–July 1846).
