Fernand-Gustave-Gaston Labori,  (born April 18, 1860, Reims, Franceâ€”died  March 14, 1917, Paris) French lawyer who served as defense counsel in the prosecution of Alfred Dreyfus for treason.
Educated at Reims and Paris, Labori spent several years in England and Germany. He was called to the bar in 1884 and rapidly made a reputation as a brilliant lawyer and advocate, being counsel for the defense in most of the important political trials of the day during a period of nearly 30 years. His conduct of the Dreyfus case placed him at the top of his profession. He fought with unremitting energy for his client during both the first and second revisions of the trial, in 1898 and 1899. Labori was shot at and wounded at Rennes on the eve of his cross-examination of the witnesses for the prosecution. Dreyfus was not finally declared innocent until 1906, and Labori never once relaxed his efforts on behalf of the unfortunate officer.
