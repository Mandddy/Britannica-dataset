Andrés Bello,  (born Nov. 29, 1781, Caracas [now in Venezuela]—died  Oct. 15, 1865, Santiago, Chile) poet and scholar, regarded as the intellectual father of South America.
His early reading in the classics, particularly Virgil, influenced his style and theories. At the University of Venezuela in Caracas he studied philosophy, jurisprudence, and medicine. Acquaintanceship with the German naturalist and traveller Alexander von Humboldt (1799) led to the interest in geography so apparent in his later writings. He was a friend and teacher of the South American liberator, Simón Bolívar, with whom he was sent to London in 1810 on a political mission for the Venezuelan revolutionary junta. Bello elected to stay there for 19 years, acting as secretary to the legations of Chile and Colombia and spending his free time in study, teaching, and journalism.
