Columbine, Italian Colombina,  stock theatrical character that originated about 1530 in Italian commedia dell’arte as a saucy and adroit servant girl; her Italian name means “Little Dove.” Her costume included a cap and apron but seldom a commedia mask, and she usually spoke in the Tuscan dialect. In French theatre the character became a lady’s maid and intrigant and assumed a variety of roles opposite Cassandre, Pantalone (Pantaloon), Harlequin, and Pierrot. In English comedies she was usually the daughter or ward of Pantaloon and in love with Harlequin. The soubrette of the 20th-century musical comedy is a version of the Columbine character.
