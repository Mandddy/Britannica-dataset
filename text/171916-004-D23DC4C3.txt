Dominique Pire, in full Dominique Georges Henri Pire   (born February 10, 1910, Dinant, Belgium—died January 30, 1969, Leuven) Belgian cleric and educator who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1958 for his aid to displaced persons in Europe after World War II.
Pire entered the Dominican monastery of La Sarte at Huy, Belgium, in 1928 and was ordained in 1934. From 1932 to 1936 he studied at the Dominican university in Rome and obtained his doctorate there in 1936. He returned to the monastery of La Sarte to teach moral philosophy (1937–47). He was active in the World War II resistance movement and later became deeply involved in the enormous refugee problem. In 1949 he founded Aid to Displaced Persons, which sought to guarantee moral and material aid to refugees, regardless of their nationality or religion, and soon had branches throughout Europe. Between 1950 and 1954 Pire founded four “homes of welcome” in Belgium for aged refugees. Seven European “villages” were subsequently founded in Germany, Belgium, and Austria (1956–62). Pire also initiated the system of sponsors that allowed a refugee to be helped by a person in another country.
