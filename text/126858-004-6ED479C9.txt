Charles Richard Drew,  (born June 3, 1904, Washington, D.C., U.S.—died  April 1, 1950, near Burlington, N.C.) African American physician and surgeon who was an authority on the preservation of human blood for transfusion.
Drew was educated at Amherst College (graduated 1926), McGill University, Montreal (1933), and Columbia University (1940). While earning his doctorate at Columbia in the late 1930s, he conducted research into the properties and preservation of blood plasma. He soon developed efficient ways to process and store large quantities of blood plasma in “blood banks.” As the leading authority in the field, he organized and directed the blood-plasma programs of the United States and Great Britain in the early years of World War II, while also agitating the authorities to stop excluding the blood of African Americans from plasma-supply networks.
