Agni, (
        Sanskrit: “Fire”) fire-god of Hinduism, second only to Indra in the Vedic mythology of ancient India. He is equally the fire of the sun, of lightning, and of both the domestic and the sacrificial hearth. As the divine personification of the fire of sacrifice, he is the mouth of the gods, the carrier of the oblation, and the messenger between the human and the divine orders. Agni is described in the scriptures as ruddy-hued and having two faces—one beneficent and one malignant. He has three or seven tongues, hair that stands on end like flames, three legs, and seven arms; he is accompanied by a ram, the usual sacrificial animal. In the Rigveda he is sometimes identified with Rudra, the forerunner of the god Shiva. Though Agni has no sect in modern Hinduism, his presence is invoked in many ceremonies, especially by Agnihotri Brahmans (who perform fire rites), and he is the guardian of the southeast.
