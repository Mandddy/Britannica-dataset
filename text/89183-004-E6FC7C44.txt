Porgy, any of about 100 species of marine fishes of the family Sparidae (order Perciformes). Porgies, sometimes called sea breams, are typically high-backed snapper- or grunt-like fishes. They have a single dorsal fin, and their small mouths, equipped with strong teeth, can handle a diet of fishes and hard-shelled invertebrates.
Porgies are generally shallow-water fishes and are found throughout tropical and temperate waters. Most do not exceed a size of about 30 cm (1 foot), but some may grow to four times that length. The family is represented by a number of food and game fishes. South Africa, with an exceptional variety of species, is the home of the musselcrackersâ€”popular sport fishes growing as heavy as 45 kg (100 pounds). In Australia several important food species are known as snappers and belong to the genus Chrysophrys; in Japan a related species, the red tai (C. major), is another important food fish.
