Michael VII Ducas, also called Michael VII Parapinaces   (born c. 1050, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died c. 1090, Constantinople) Byzantine emperor (1071–78) whose policies hastened the conquest of Asia Minor by the Turks.
The eldest son of Constantine X Ducas, Michael was a minor on his father’s death (May 21, 1067), and his mother assumed the regency. Because of the dangerous military and political situation, she soon married the military commander Romanus Diogenes, who was crowned coemperor as Romanus IV in January 1068. On the defeat of Romanus by the Seljuq Turks at Manzikert in 1071, Michael was proclaimed sole emperor (October 24).
