Battle of the Pyramids, also called Battle of Embabeh,  (July 21, 1798), military engagement in which Napoleon Bonaparte and his French troops captured Cairo. His victory was attributed to the implementation of his one significant tactical innovation, the massive divisional square.
Bonaparte, then a general and key military adviser for the French Revolutionary government (Directory), had proposed the invasion of Egypt in early 1798. Control of Egypt would provide France with a new source of income while simultaneously blocking the Red Sea, a major route of English access to India, thus disrupting a significant source of revenue for France’s main European opponent. The plan was quickly approved. Napoleon set sail for Egypt on May 19, 1798, with approximately 400 ships and 30,000 men. The invaders landed near Alexandria, on July 1, only narrowly missing British Adm. Horatio Nelson, who had been searching the area for them just days earlier. The French easily took possession of the weakly defended city the next day. Ostensibly an Ottoman territory, Egypt was then ruled by the Mamlūks, descendants of Muslim slave soldiers, who had infiltrated the Ottoman ranks through military advancement. They had left Alexandria, at that point sparsely populated, with only a paltry garrison, leaving the citizens to defend themselves.
