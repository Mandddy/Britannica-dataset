Ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), 45-cm (18-inch) black-and-white bird with a flaring crest (red in the male) and a long whitish bill. It belongs to the family Picidae (order Piciformes). The species was thought to be extinct, though there were unconfirmed sightings of the bird in the southern United States in the late 1990s. In 2005 a team of researchers announced that the ivory-billed woodpecker had indeed been sighted in eastern Arkansas. The speciesâ€™ decline coincided with the logging of virgin forest, where it had subsisted on deadwood insects. A subspecies, the Cuban ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis bairdii), was last officially sighted in the late 1980s and is believed to be extinct. A related species, the imperial woodpecker (C. imperialis) of Mexico, is the largest woodpecker in the world. It is critically endangered and possibly extinct. All these birds appear to require large trees and isolation from disturbance.
