Willie Pep, original name Guglielmo Papaleo, byname Will o’ the Wisp  (born Sept. 19, 1922, Middletown, Conn., U.S.—died Nov. 23, 2006, Rocky Hill, Conn.) American professional boxer, world featherweight (126 pounds) champion during the 1940s. Pep specialized in finesse rather than slugging prowess and competed successfully in the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s. His rivalry with American Sandy Saddler is considered one of the greatest of 20th-century American pugilism.
Pep began his professional boxing career in 1940. He won his first 63 fights before losing a 10-round decision (a fight whose outcome is determined by judges’ scoring) to a former lightweight champion, American Sammy Angott (Salvatore Engotti), in an nontitle fight on March 19, 1943. Pep then went on a 73-bout undefeated streak over the next five years. Before his loss to Angott, Pep had won the world featherweight championship by beating American Albert (“Chalky”) Wright in a 15-round decision on Nov. 20, 1942. After defending this title with a 15-round decision over American Sal Bartolo on June 8, 1943, Pep served in the U.S. Army and then the U.S. Navy before being honourably discharged in 1945. His military service did not prevent him from boxing, and his next title defense was a 15-round decision over Wright on Sept. 29, 1944. Pep made two more successful defenses in 1945 and 1946, before he was severely injured in a plane crash in January 1947. He resumed boxing in June and won all 10 of his matches that year, defending his title once. He made another successful defense by knocking out Humberto Sierra (in their second fight) in the 10th round on Feb. 24, 1948, but on Oct. 29, 1948, Pep was knocked out for the first time in his career, falling to Saddler in the fourth round of their match. Pep regained the title with a 15-round decision over Saddler on Feb. 11, 1949, and he was successful in his next three title matches. However, Saddler knocked him out in the eighth round of their third fight on Sept. 8, 1950, to take away the title, and when Pep tried to regain it on Sept. 26, 1951, Saddler scored a ninth-round knockout. Pep retired in 1959, but he returned to the ring in 1965 and won all nine of his matches. His career ended after he lost by decision to American Calvin Woodland in a six-round match on March 16, 1966. It was the 11th loss of a 242-bout career in which Pep won 230 matches, 65 by knockout, and was involved in 1 draw. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.
