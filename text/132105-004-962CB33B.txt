John Goodman, in full John Stephen Goodman  (born June 20, 1952, Affton, Missouri, U.S.) American actor who is perhaps best known for his long-running role as Dan Conner in the television series Roseanne (1988–97). His imposing physical stature often garnered him movie roles playing over-the-top, larger-than-life figures.
Goodman attended Southwest Missouri State University on a football scholarship. An injury, however, ended his chances of a football career, and he began studying drama. After graduating in 1975, he moved to New York City to pursue acting jobs. He took roles in tiny dinner theatres and in television commercials before being cast in the Broadway production of Loose Ends in 1979. A few years later he again performed on Broadway in Big River (1985) as Huck Finn’s father, the role for which he first received critical attention. Goodman began to regularly appear in films in the early 1980s, and in 1987 he played an escaped convict in the Coen brothers’ quirky comedy Raising Arizona. His breakthrough, however, came when he was cast as the all-American blue-collar family man in the hit comedy television series Roseanne. His performances in this role earned him seven Emmy Award nominations and a Golden Globe Award (1993).
