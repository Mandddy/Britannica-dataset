Limpkin, also called Courlan, orCrying Bird,   (species Aramus guarauna), large swamp bird of the American tropics, sole member of the family Aramidae (order Gruiformes). The bird is about 70 cm (28 inches) long and is coloured brown with white spots. The limpkin’s most distinctive characteristics are its loud, prolonged, wailing cry and its peculiar halting gait. The species ranges the lowlands from the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, and Hispaniola south to central Argentina.
The limpkin is found along borders of wooded streams, bayous, and sloughs, or in open marshes and sometimes in uplands, where it runs through brush with long strides or perches on small trees. The limpkin flies like a crane, with short concave wings slowly flapping, neck extended, and legs dangling. It feeds on mollusks, crustaceans, aquatic insects, frogs, and worms. In the Florida Everglades it feeds chiefly on large, greenish, freshwater snails (Ampullaria). These, carried to its nest or favourite feeding perch and held firmly in one foot, are struck several powerful blows with the bill, which is then forced into the spiral opening of the shell to pull out the snail. The limpkin’s bulky nest of leaves, twigs, and Spanish moss is found among grasses or shrubs, or in a low tree over or near water. Its eggs, four to six, rarely eight, are buff, splashed with brown and drab.
