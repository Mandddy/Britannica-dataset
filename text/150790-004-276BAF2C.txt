Baḥr al-Jabal, also spelled Bahr el-Jebel, English Mountain Nile,  that section of the Nile River between Nimule near the Uganda border and Malakal in South Sudan. Below Nimule the river flows northward over the Fula Rapids, past Juba (the head of navigation), and through Al-Sudd, the enormous papyrus-choked swamp where half its water is lost. It receives the Baḥr al-Ghazāl at Lake No and then turns east to join with the Sobat River of western Ethiopia above Malakal, thereafter forming the White Nile. Much of the river’s 594-mile (956-km) course winds between walls of high papyrus, reeds, and elephant grass, which during the dry season provide grazing for cattle.
