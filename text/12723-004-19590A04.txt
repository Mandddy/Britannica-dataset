John M. Cooper, in full John Montgomery Cooper  (born Oct. 28, 1881, Rockville, Md., U.S.—died  May 22, 1949, Washington, D.C.) U.S. Roman Catholic priest, ethnologist, and sociologist, who specialized in studies of the “marginal peoples” of southern South America, northern North America, and other regions. He viewed these peoples as having been pushed back into less desirable territories by later migrations and as representing cultural survivals from prehistoric times.
Ordained in 1905, Cooper became a part-time instructor at the Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., in 1909. His first ethnological work, An Analytical and Critical Bibliography of the Tribes of Tierra del Fuego and Adjacent Territory (1917), marked the beginning of his writing on marginal cultures. Concerned with group social work and varied sociological questions from 1917 to 1925, he became an associate professor (1923) and a professor (1928) of sociology and he served as chairman of the first department of anthropology in a Catholic university (1934–49).
