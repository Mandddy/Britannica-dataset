Jo Jones, byname of Jonathon Jones   (born Oct. 7, 1911, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—died  Sept. 3, 1985, New York, N.Y.) black American musician, one of the most influential of all jazz drummers, noted for his swing, dynamic subtlety, and finesse.
Jones grew up in Alabama, studied music for 12 years, and became a skilled trumpeter and pianist; he toured with carnivals as a tap dancer as well as an instrumentalist. He played with Southwestern “territory bands” (i.e., those in the South, Southwest, and Midwest), including Walter Page’s Blue Devils, before joining Count Basie’s Kansas City band in 1934. With few breaks, most notably his U.S. Army service (1944–46), he remained with Basie until 1948, after which he led a freelance career. He made the first of several “Jazz at the Philharmonic” tours in 1947, occasionally led his own groups, and recorded with swing-era contemporaries such as Billie Holiday, Teddy Wilson, Buck Clayton, and Lester Young.
