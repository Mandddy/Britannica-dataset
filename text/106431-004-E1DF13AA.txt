Ken Livingstone, in full Kenneth Robert Livingstone  (born June 17, 1945, Lambeth, London, England) British politician, who made constitutional history on May 4, 2000, when he was elected mayor of London—the first time that British voters had directly elected a candidate to an executive office at any level of government. He served as mayor until May 2008.
Livingstone was born in Lambeth, an inner London borough. He left school at age 17 and started work as a laboratory technician. By his early 20s he was an active Labour Party member. He was elected to the Lambeth Borough Council in 1971 and to the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1973. Between 1977 and 1981, when the GLC was run by members of the Conservative Party, Livingstone led a left-wing faction within Labour’s group in the GLC. In the GLC elections of May 1981, Labour won a majority. Livingstone immediately challenged the party’s moderate GLC leader, Andrew McIntosh, who had led the party to victory. Backed by a majority of Labour GLC councillors, Livingstone took over the running of the council.
