Cape Breton Highlands National Park, park on Cape Breton Island, in northern Nova Scotia, Canada, that was established in 1936, when 367 square miles (951 square km) of the islandâ€™s northern section were reserved for public use. It lies between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and its highest point is over 1,700 feet (518 metres) above sea level. Its irregular topography resulted from long erosion by rivers, followed by Ice Age glacial action. The area is covered by forest, predominantly fir, spruce, birch, and poplar, except for a central plateau, which features muskeg, lakes, and heath. There are various mammals and birds, including seabirds. A scenic highway, the Cabot Trail, runs around three sides of the park and connects with the Nova Scotia mainland via a causeway.
