Saiga (Saiga tatarica), medium-sized hoofed mammal of the family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla) that lives in herds in treeless steppe country. Once common from Poland to western Mongolia, it has been greatly reduced by hunting and habitat destruction and now exists in locations in southwestern Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. Since 2002 the saiga has been considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be critically endangered.
The most outstanding feature of the saiga is its swollen snout with downward-directed nostrils. The snout serves to warm and moisten inhaled air; it may be related to the animal’s keen sense of smell, and it may also work as a sounding chamber for rutting calls. The adult saiga stands about 76 cm (30 inches) at the shoulder and weighs 31 to 43 kg (68 to 95 pounds). Females are roughly three-quarters the size of males. The saiga’s coat is short and pale brown in summer and thick and whitish in winter. During rut, an adult male attempts to control a group of 5 to 10 females, preventing females from leaving and attacking any intruding male. After a gestation of five months, females give birth to one or two young, which remain crouched and hidden in the grass for four to eight days.
