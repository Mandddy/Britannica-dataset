John Hill,  (born c. 1714, Peterborough?, Eng.â€”died  Nov. 21, 1775, London) English writer and botanist who compiled the first book on British flora to be based on the Linnaean nomenclature.
After serving as an apprentice to an apothecary, Hill set up his own apothecary shop in London and studied botany in his spare time. Employed by the Duke of Richmond and Lord Petre to arrange their collections of plants, he travelled extensively to collect rare species for them. When these efforts failed to increase his income, he turned to writing plays, novels, and papers on natural history, medicine, astronomy, and geology. He edited the monthly British Magazine from 1746 to 1750 and contributed a daily society-gossip column to The London Advertiser and the Literary Gazette. His satirical writings often involved him in bitter quarrels.
