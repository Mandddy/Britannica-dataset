Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, marquise de Pompadour,  byname Madame de Pompadour, also called (1741–45) Jeanne-Antoinette Le Normant d’Étioles  (born Dec. 29, 1721, Paris, France—died April 15, 1764, Versailles) influential mistress (from 1745) of the French king Louis XV and a notable patron of literature and the arts.
Her parents were on the fringes of a class gaining in importance, speculators in the world of finance. Some of these people made immense fortunes, but many ended in the gutter if not in prison. Her father, François Poisson, involved in a black-market scandal, had to flee the country in 1725; his beautiful wife and two small children were then looked after by a more fortunate colleague, Le Normant de Tournehem. Both children were clever, and the girl was fascinating; she was educated to be the wife of a rich man. In those days rich men, even if they came from a low class, were interested in art and literature, and they expected their wives to share these interests.
