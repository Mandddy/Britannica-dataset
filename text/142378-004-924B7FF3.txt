Laki,  volcanic fissure and mountain in southern Iceland, just southwest of Vatna Glacier (Vatnajokull), the island’s largest ice field. Mount Laki was the only conspicuous topographic feature in the path of the developing fissure eruption that is now known as Lakagígar (English: “Laki Craters”).
The fissure, which extends northeast-southwest, is divided into two nearly equal halves by the 2,684-foot (818-metre) mountain, which rises some 650 feet (200 m) above its immediate surroundings. Mount Laki was not completely breached by the fissure; between the fissure cuts on the slopes of the mountain, there are only a few very small craters that extruded small amounts of lava. The eruption began on June 8, 1783. Until July 29 activity was confined to the fissure southwest of Mount Laki. On July 29 the fissure northeast of the mountain became active, and from that time almost all activity was confined to that half of the fissure. The eruption lasted until early February 1784, and it is considered to be the greatest lava eruption on Earth in historical times. The commonly accepted figure for the volume of lava extruded is about 2.95 cubic miles (12.3 cubic km); that for the area covered, about 220 square miles (565 square km). The enormous quantity of volcanic gases that was released caused a conspicuous haze over most of continental Europe; haze was even reported in Syria, in the Altai Mountains in western Siberia, and in North Africa. The vast quantities of sulfurous gases stunted crops and grasses and killed most of the domestic animals in Iceland; the resulting Haze Famine eventually killed about one-fifth of Iceland’s population.
