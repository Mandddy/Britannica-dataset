Weapons system,  any integrated system, usually computerized, for the control and operation of weapons of a particular kind. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, long-range bombers, and antiballistic missiles are the weaponry of the strategic weapons system. Guided missiles operating at shorter range, e.g., anti-aircraft or battlefield weapons and air-to-air or air-to-surface attack-type missiles, constitute a tactical weapons system.
