Basilica of Guadalupe, officially Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Spanish Basílica de Guadalupe, or Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe,  Roman Catholic church that is the chief religious centre of Mexico, located in Villa de Guadalupe Hidalgo, a northern neighbourhood of Mexico City. The church was erected near the spot where two apparitions of the Virgin are said to have appeared to an Indian convert named Juan Diego in December 1531 and commanded that a church be built. The second apparition resulted in a painted image that became known as the Virgin of Guadalupe, and the entire incident did much to hasten the conversion of the Indians of Mexico to Christianity. In 1754 a papal bull made the Virgin of Guadalupe the patroness and protector of New Spain, and in 1810 she became the symbol of the Mexican independence movement when the patriot-priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla raised her picture to his banner.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to the church, the holiest in Mexico, which was given the status of a basilica by Pope Pius X in 1904. The present church, or Old Basilica, was constructed on the site of an earlier 16th-century church and was finished in 1709. When this basilica became dangerous owing to the sinking of its foundations, a modern structure called the New Basilica was built nearby; the original image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is now housed in the New Basilica.
