David E. Kelley,  (born April 4, 1956, Waterville, Maine, U.S.) American writer and producer who was best known for creating television series set among the legal profession and populated with quirky characters. His notable shows include Ally McBeal (1997–2002), The Practice (1997–2004), and Boston Legal (2004–08).
Kelley attended Princeton University, where he graduated with a degree in politics in 1979. Thereafter, he enrolled at Boston University Law School, where he received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1983 and then joined a Boston law firm. That same year he began working on a feature film, From the Hip (1987), which explored the ethics of a young lawyer and was moderately successful at the box office. When the script was brought to the attention of television producer Steven Bochco, who at the time was looking for writers with legal backgrounds for his new show, Kelley was hired almost immediately as the story editor of L.A. Law in 1986. He quit the law firm and moved to California, and, at age 33 and after the show’s third season, he became executive producer. L.A. Law won the Emmy Award for outstanding drama series four of the years Kelley worked on the show. In 1989 he helped create Doogie Howser, M.D., a dramedy about a teenaged doctor, and he wrote many of its early scripts.
