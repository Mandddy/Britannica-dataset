Guo Moruo, Wade-Giles romanization Kuo Mo-jo, original name Guo Kaizhen  (born November 1892, Shawan, Leshan county, Sichuan province, China—died June 12, 1978, Beijing) Chinese scholar, one of the leading writers of 20th-century China, and an important government official.
The son of a wealthy merchant, Guo Moruo early manifested a stormy, unbridled temperament. After receiving a traditional education, he in 1913 abandoned his Chinese wife from an arranged marriage and went to Japan to study medicine. There he fell in love with a Japanese woman who became his common-law wife. He began to devote himself to the study of foreign languages and literature, reading works by Spinoza, Goethe, the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, and Walt Whitman. His own early poetry was highly emotional free verse reminiscent of Whitman and Percy Bysshe Shelley. The new-style poems that Guo published in Shishi xinbao (“New Journal on Current Affairs”) were later compiled into the anthology Nü shen (1921; “Goddess”). Its publication laid the first cornerstone for the development of new verse in China. In the same year, Guo, together with Cheng Fangwu, Yu Dafu, and Zhang Ziping, gave impetus to the establishment of the Creation Society, one of the most important literary societies during the May Fourth period in China. Guo’s translation of Goethe’s Sorrows of Young Werther gained enormous popularity among Chinese youth soon after its publication in 1922. He became interested in the philosophy of the Japanese Marxist Kawakami Hajime, one of whose books he translated in 1924, and Guo soon embraced Marxism. Although his own writing remained tinged with Romanticism, he declared his rejection of individualistic literature, calling for a “socialist literature that is sympathetic toward the proletariat.”
