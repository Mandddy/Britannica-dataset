Charles Frohman,  (born June 17, 1860, Sandusky, Ohio, U.S.—died May 7, 1915, at sea) leading American theatrical manager of his time.
Frohman became interested in theatrical activities through his older brothers, Daniel and Gustave. After several years of part-time positions with local newspapers and theatres, Frohman in 1883 managed the Wallack Theatre Company on tour. He later opened a theatrical booking office in New York and laid the foundation of the Theatrical Syndicate, which for several years controlled U.S. theatres. Frohman’s initial success was Bronson Howard’s Shenandoah in 1889. In 1892 he engaged John Drew as his star and established the Empire Stock Company. Frohman’s encouragement of such playwrights as Clyde Fitch, David Belasco, and Augustus Thomas and stars such as Maude Adams, Ethel Barrymore, Julia Marlowe, Billie Burke, William Gillette, and Otis Skinner was indicative of his ability to perceive theatrical talent. He dominated the American theatre during 25 of its most expansive years. When he drowned in the sinking of the Lusitania, an era ended.
