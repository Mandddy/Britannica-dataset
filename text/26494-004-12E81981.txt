Alberto Santos-Dumont,  (born July 20, 1873, Cabangu, near Palmyra [now Santos-Dumont], Minas Gerais, Braz.—died July 23, 1932, Guarujá, São Paulo) Brazilian aviation pioneer who captured the imagination of Europe and the United States with his airship flights and made the first significant flight of a powered airplane in Europe with his No. 14-bis.
Santos-Dumont, the son of a wealthy coffee planter, traveled to France to study engineering, and he soon became fascinated by flight. His first balloon design was the Brazil, which he flew in 1898. However, he quickly turned his attention to powered airships. A total of 11 dirigibles emerged from Santos-Dumont’s workshop over the next decade.
