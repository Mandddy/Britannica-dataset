George Ticknor,  (born August 1, 1791, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died January 26, 1871, Boston) American author and educator who helped modernize the curriculum at Harvard University.
Educated at Dartmouth College, Ticknor first practiced law but then went to Europe to study (1815–19), returning to the United States to become professor of French and Spanish languages and literatures and professor of belles-lettres at Harvard. During his 16 years at Harvard, Ticknor introduced the study of contemporary writers (the curriculum having previously been confined almost exclusively to the classics) and was the first to suggest that Harvard be organized on departmental lines, a suggestion that was adopted a few years later. From 1835 to 1838 Ticknor traveled in Europe, returning to work on his monumental History of Spanish Literature, which was published in three volumes in 1849. It was the first comprehensive study of Spanish literature. Ticknor was a founder of the Boston Public Library in 1848 and bequeathed to the library his valuable collection of books on Spanish literature. He was the author of a number of other works, of which the chief was a biography (1864) of historian William H. Prescott.
