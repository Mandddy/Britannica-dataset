Christy Mathewson, in full Christopher Mathewson, also called Matty and Big Six  (born Aug. 12, 1880, Factoryville, Pa., U.S.—died Oct. 7, 1925, Saranac Lake, N.Y.) American professional baseball player, regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the game.
Mathewson was one of the first “college men” to enter the major leagues, having played football and baseball at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa. After pitching for teams in various independent leagues during the summers following his freshman and sophomore years, his contract was purchased by the New York Giants of the National League (NL), and Mathewson made his major league debut at age 19 in July 1900. He appeared in only six games during his first season, but he entered the Giants’ starting pitching rotation in 1901, when he placed sixth in the NL in both earned run average (ERA) and wins.
