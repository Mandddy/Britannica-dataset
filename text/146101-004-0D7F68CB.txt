Verulamium, also called (Celtic) Verlamio or Verlamion,  pre-Roman and Romano-British town in the territory of the Catuvellauni, across the River Ver from what is now St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England.
Before the Roman conquest, Verlamion was the capital of Tasciovanus, king of the Catuvellauni (c. 20 bc–ad 5). The Romans occupied the site with soldiers in 44–45 but built a regular town, which may have been a municipium, by 50. This town was destroyed in ad 60–61 by Boudicca (Boadicea), queen of the Iceni, and was rebuilt 15 years later, under Vespasian, to whom the new forum was dedicated in 79. An inscription mentions the governor, Julius Agricola, Tacitus’s father-in-law and the subject of his Agricola. Among the ruins of Varulamium are the forum, a theatre associated with a Romano-Celtic temple, a market hall, two triumphal arches, fragments of the town wall, and many well-appointed houses with fine mosaics and wall paintings. Devastated by a fire under Antonius Pius, the city again was rebuilt before the end of the 2nd century. St. Alban was martyred here c. 208–209. The site was deserted in the late 5th century. The growth of a new settlement in nearby St. Albans has left the Roman town open to excavation.
