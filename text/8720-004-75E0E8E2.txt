Wood frog (Rana sylvatica), terrestrial frog (family Ranidae) of forests and woodlands. It is a cool-climate species that occurs from the northeastern quarter of the United States and throughout most of Canada to central and southern Alaska.
The wood frog is tan to brown with a distinctly dark facial mask. Its maximum length is approximately 8.25 cm (3.25 inches), and its maximum weight is approximately 8 grams (0.3 ounce). It is an early spring breeder, using the vernal pools created by meltwater and late winter rains. Breeding occurs between early March and early May, during which females lay a globular mass of several hundred to a few thousand eggs. Development is moderately fast and temperature-dependent. Metamorphosis takes place over the subsequent two to three months. The maleâ€™s voice is a ducklike quack.
