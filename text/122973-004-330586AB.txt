Numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus), also called banded anteater,  marsupial mammal of the family Myrmecobiidae, of which it is the sole living representative.
The numbat forages by day for termites in woodlands of Australia; it is one of the few diurnal (active by day) Australian marsupials. It has a squat body and a small pointed head with a very long snout; the head and body together are about 20–27 cm (roughly 8–11 inches) long, and there is a 13–20-cm (5–8-inch) bushy tail. Its coat generally is reddish brown, becoming blacker toward the rump, and there are about seven or eight transverse white stripes on the body from behind the forelegs to the rump, where they are most clearly marked. The teeth are small, and there are extra molars, giving a total number of 50–52 teeth. The tongue is long and sticky, and the forefeet are strong-clawed, for digging. The numbat is pouchless; it normally has four young a year.
