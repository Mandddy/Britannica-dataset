Mandu, also called Mandava or Mandogarh,  ruined city, southwestern Madhya Pradesh state, central India. It lies at an elevation of 2,079 feet (634 metres) above sea level in the Vindhya Range, 38 miles (60 km) southwest of Indore.
Mandu is thought to have been founded in the 6th century ce by an individual named Munjadeva. It was ruled for a time by the Paramaras, a Rajput (warrior caste) clan, until they were defeated in the early 14th century by Muslim invaders. Mandu then became famous as the 14th–15th-century capital of the Muslim Malwa kingdom. The city reached its zenith under Hoshang Shah (ruled 1405–34), but it declined with the advent of the Mughals. Mandu underwent a period of conquest and annexation by Humayun (1534), Shēr Shah of Sūr (1542), Akbar (1561), and others. It also served as the headquarters of a district (sarkar) under the Mughals, who made it a retreat locale. The Marathas captured Mandu in 1732, after which it remained part of the territory of the Pawars of Dhar.
