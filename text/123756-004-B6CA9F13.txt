Silica gel,  a highly porous, noncrystalline form of silica used to remove moisture from gases and liquids, to thicken liquids, to impart a dull surface to paints and synthetic films, and for other purposes.
Silica gel was known as early as 1640, but it remained a curiosity until its adsorbent properties were found useful in gas masks during World War I. It is generally prepared by acidification of a solution of a silicate, such as water glass; the resulting silicic acid forms either a rigid mass or a gelatinous precipitate from which soluble materials are removed by washing with water. The water is finally removed by heating, leaving a glassy, granular solid. For highest activity as a desiccant, the gel is not completely dehydrated but is left with a small percentage of combined water.
