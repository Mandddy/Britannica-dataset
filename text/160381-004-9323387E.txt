Sándor Petőfi, Hungarian form Petőfi Sándor  (born January 1, 1823, Kiskőrös, Hungary, Austrian Empire—died probably July 31, 1849, Segesvár, Transylvania, Austrian Empire [now Sighișoara, Romania]) one of the greatest Hungarian poets and a revolutionary who symbolized the Hungarian desire for freedom.
Petőfi had an eventful youth; he studied at eight different schools, joined for a short time a group of strolling players, and enlisted as a private soldier, but because of ill health he was soon dismissed from the army. He traveled extensively in Hungary, mostly on foot. As a schoolboy, he displayed a keen interest in the stage and in literature, and his first poem was published in 1842. After years of vicissitudes, in 1844, on the recommendation of Mihály Vörösmarty, then the leading Hungarian poet, he became an assistant editor of the literary periodical Pesti Divatlap. His first volume of poetry, Versek, appeared in the same year and made him famous at once, though the tone of his poems scandalized many. In 1847 he married Julia Szendrey, who inspired his best love poems.
