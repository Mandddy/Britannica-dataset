Gomati River, also called Gumti,  tributary of the Ganges (Ganga) River, central Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. It rises in northern Uttar Pradesh about 32 miles (51 km) east of Pilibhit and is intermittent for the first 35 miles (56 km) of its course, becoming perennial after its junction with the Joknai. Below this point it flows generally southeastward for some 500 miles (800 km), receiving its only major tributary, the right-bank Sai River, near Jaunpur and emptying into the Ganges near Saidpur. It drains a basin of about 7,240 square miles (18,750 square km).
