Kyrgyz literature, the written works of the Kyrgyz people of Central Asia, most of whom live in Kyrgyzstan. A smaller population of Kyrgyz in China also produces works of literary significance.
The literary history of the modern-day Kyrgyz begins in the early 19th century, notwithstanding disputed attempts by scholars to identify as “Old Kyrgyz” the language of runic Turkic inscriptions from the Yenisey River basin (9th to 11th centuries). The language of the earliest surviving works of Kyrgyz literature in manuscript, including the 19th-century poems of Moldo Nïyaz, is Chagatai, the common Turkic literary language of Central Asia, modified with features drawn from spoken Kyrgyz. (See also Chagatai literature.) From the Russian Revolution of 1917 until the 1930s, written Kyrgyz continued to develop under influences from the related Kazakh, Uzbek, and Tatar languages, owing in part to the slow development of Kyrgyz-language instruction. Prerevolutionary Kyrgyz was written in the Arabic alphabet; this was reformed and standardized in 1924. In 1927 the Kyrgyz writing system was switched to one based on the Latin alphabet, and in 1941 this was replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet, which continues in use today in Kyrgyzstan. (The Kyrgyz of the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang in China still use an Arabic alphabet.)
