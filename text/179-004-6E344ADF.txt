Lamoraal, graaf van Egmond, Egmond also spelled Egmont  (born Nov. 18, 1522, La Hamaide, Hainaut [now in Belgium]—died June 5, 1568, Brussels) leader in the early opposition to the policies of Philip II of Spain in the Netherlands. Although Egmond did not favour the overthrow of Spanish sovereignty, he became one of the first and most illustrious victims of the duke of Alba’s repressive regime (1567–73). He is the hero of J.W. von Goethe’s drama Egmont.
Belonging to a powerful family of the Netherlands, Lamoraal succeeded to the countship, in Holland, in 1541 and three years later married Sabina of Bavaria, daughter of John II, count palatine of Simmern. A trusted adviser of the emperor Charles V, Egmond represented the emperor’s son, Philip II, in asking for the hand of Mary I, the Roman Catholic queen of England. He had a distinguished military record, most notably in the victories over the French at Saint-Quentin (1557) and Gravelines (1558). In 1559 he was named stadtholder (chief provincial executive) of Flanders and Artois and a member of the advisory council of the regent, Margaret of Parma.
