Sir Seretse Khama,  (born July 1, 1921, Serowe, Bechuanaland [now Botswana]—died  July 13, 1980, Gaborone, Botswana) first president of Botswana (1966–80), after the former Bechuanaland protectorate gained independence from Great Britain.
Seretse Khama was the grandson of Khama III the Good, who had allied his kingdom in Bechuanaland with British colonizers in the late 19th century. Seretse Khama succeeded his father to the chieftainship of the Ngwato (Mangwato, or Bamangwato) people at age four. He was educated in South Africa and studied law at the University of Oxford. His marriage to Ruth Williams, a British woman, in 1948 caused considerable controversy in both Britain and Bechuanaland and was among the reasons the British government forced his exile from Bechuanaland until he agreed to renounce the chieftainship in 1956.
