Liu Xiaobo,  (born Dec. 28, 1955, Changchun, Jilin province, China) Chinese literary critic, professor, and human rights activist who called for democratic reforms and the end of one-party rule in China. In 2010 he became the first Chinese citizen to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Liu graduated from Jilin University in 1982, and he continued his studies at Beijing Normal University, earning a Ph.D. in 1988. By then Liu had already established himself as a prolific and erudite critic, rising to prominence in 1986 with a stinging examination of modern Chinese literature. He undertook a lecture tour of Norway and the United States in 1988â€“89, returning to Beijing as the pro-democracy movement in that city began to gather strength.
