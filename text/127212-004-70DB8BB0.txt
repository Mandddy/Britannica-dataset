Christian Louboutin,  (born 1964, Paris, France) French shoe designer whose creations—identifiable by their brilliant red soles—were sold in exclusive upscale boutiques in major cities worldwide.
As a teenage apprentice in the dressing rooms of the Folies-Bergère, the famed Parisian music hall, Louboutin was impressed with the ability of the showgirls to remain sure-footed while wearing huge headdresses; it was then, in the early 1980s, that he realized the strength of his interest in footwear design. Following his apprenticeship at the Folies-Bergère, Louboutin gained experience through periodic work for the venerable Paris shoe brand Charles Jourdan with the master shoe designer Roger Vivier—who became Louboutin’s mentor—and as a designer for the fashion houses formed by Coco Chanel, Maud Frizon, and Yves Saint Laurent.
