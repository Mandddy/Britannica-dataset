Parnassian butterfly,  any member of the insect subfamily Parnassiinae of the cosmopolitan family Papilionidae (order Lepidoptera). The parnassian (Parnassius), also known as apollo, found in mountainous alpine regions in Asia, Europe, and North America, is a medium-sized butterfly, generally with translucent white, yellow, or gray wings with dark markings and usually a red or orange spot on the hindwing.
Unlike most butterflies, parnassians pupate inside cocoon-like webs, usually constructed among leaves or in rubbish piles. They are prized among butterfly collectors because of their coloration. Parnassians are sometimes separated into their own family, Parnassiidae.
