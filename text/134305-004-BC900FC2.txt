Catalysis, in chemistry, the modification of the rate of a chemical reaction, usually an acceleration, by addition of a substance not consumed during the reaction. The rates of chemical reactions—that is, the velocities at which they occur—depend upon a number of factors, including the chemical nature of the reacting species and the external conditions to which they are exposed. A particular phenomenon associated with the rates of chemical reactions that is of great theoretical and practical interest is catalysis, the acceleration of chemical reactions by substances not consumed in the reactions themselves—substances known as catalysts. The study of catalysis is of interest theoretically because of what it reveals about the fundamental nature of chemical reactions; in practice, the study of catalysis is important because many industrial processes depend upon catalysts for their success. Fundamentally, the peculiar phenomenon of life would hardly be possible without the biological catalysts termed enzymes.
In a catalyzed reaction, the catalyst generally enters into chemical combination with the reactants but is ultimately regenerated, so the amount of catalyst remains unchanged. Since the catalyst is not consumed, each catalyst molecule may induce the transformation of many molecules of reactant. For an active catalyst, the number of molecules transformed per minute by one molecule of catalyst may be as large as several million.
