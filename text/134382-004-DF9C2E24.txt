Mossi, also spelled Mosi, also called Moore,  people of Burkina Faso and other parts of West Africa, especially Mali and Togo. They numbered some six million at the start of the 21st century. Their language, Moore, belongs to the Gur branch and is akin to that spoken by the Mamprusi and Dagomba of northern Ghana, from whom the Mossi ruling class trace their origin.
The Mossi are sedentary farmers, growing millet and sorghum as staples. Some artisans, such as smiths and leatherworkers, belong to low-status castes.
