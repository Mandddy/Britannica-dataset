Belgian literature, the body of written works produced by Belgians and written in Flemish, which is equivalent to the Standard Dutch (Netherlandic) language of the Netherlands, and in Standard French, which are the two main divisions of literature by language of Belgium. A lesser-known literature of Belgium, Walloon literature, is written in local dialects of French and Latin origin that are spoken in Wallonia (the provinces of Hainaut, Liège, Namur, Luxembourg, and Walloon Brabant). Flemish literature is often discussed with Dutch literature and Belgium’s French-language literature with other French literature. The French-, Flemish-, and Walloon-language literatures of Belgium are discussed in this article.
 Any consideration of the Dutch-language literature of Belgium must take into account that the Belgian territories were broadly united with the Netherlands politically, economically, and culturally until 1579, when, as a result of the Reformation, the northern (Reformed) provinces seceded from the Roman Catholic south. Thus until the early 17th century the literature of Flanders and Holland must be considered as a whole (see Dutch literature). It was in Flanders that the literature of the medieval Low Countries flowered most profusely. It was, moreover, in Flanders and Brabant that learning showed new vigour under the influence of the Renaissance and the Reformation. In literature inspired by the Reformation the tone was set by the glowing satiric verse of the Catholic Anna Bijns and the polemical satire, Biencorf der H. Roomsche Kercke (1569; “The Beehive of the Roman Catholic Church”), of the Calvinist Philips van Marnix, heer van Sint Aldegonde. The Renaissance in the Netherlands began with Lucas de Heere, Carel van Mander, and Jan Baptista van der Noot, all of whom, significantly, had fled from the south for religious reasons.
