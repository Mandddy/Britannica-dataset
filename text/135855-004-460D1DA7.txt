Nancy Huston,  (born Sept. 16, 1953, Calgary, Alberta, Can.) Canadian novelist and nonfiction author who wrote in French and English and made prizewinning translations of her own works, which explore the themes of cultural dislocation and personal identity.
As a child, Huston lived in Canada, Germany, and the United States. She left Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., to attend the École des Hautes Études in Paris, where she studied linguistics and semiotics with the French philosopher and critic Roland Barthes. She was active in the women’s movement in the 1970s and taught at Columbia University’s Institute for Feminist Studies in Paris in the 1980s. Following Barthes’s death in 1980, she focused on writing novels. She continued to live and work in France, and she married Franco-Bulgarian literary theorist and philosopher Tzvetan Todorov.
