Daedalic sculpture, type of sculpture attributed to a legendary Greek artist, Daedalus, who is connected in legend both to Bronze Age Crete and to the earliest period of Archaic sculpture in post-Bronze Age Greece. The legends about Daedalus recognize him both as a man and as a mythical embodiment. The writer Pausanias thought that wooden images were referred to as daidala even before Daedalusâ€™s time. Daedalic sculpture reveals Eastern influences, known as Orientalizing in Greek art. Orientalizing is particularly noticeable in the head seen from the front; it resembles an Eastern head, with wiglike hair, but is more angular, having a triangular face, large eyes, and a prominent nose. The female body is rather flatly geometric, with high waist and formless drapery. Early sculpture exhibiting these attributes is known as Daedalic; it was used for figurines, on clay plaques, and in relief decorations on vases. It seems to have had a marked influence in the Peloponnese, Dorian Crete, and Rhodes.
