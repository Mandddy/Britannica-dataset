Chatelaine,  ornament, used by both men and women and usually fastened to belt or pocket, with chains bearing hooks on which to hang small articles such as watches, keys, seals, writing tablets, scissors, and purses. The word chatelaine is derived from a word meaning the keeper of a castle, thus the person entrusted with the keys. During the 18th century, chatelaines were particularly popular. The finest were made of gold; cheaper ones of a yellow alloy were named pinchbeck, after the inventor of the material. Some chatelaines were decorated with repoussé or enamel and depicted biblical, mythological, or genre scenes. Others were inlaid with agate, and, toward the end of the 18th century, some were adorned with cameos in a pseudoclassical style. The most luxurious were decorated with precious gems, especially diamonds. A fine example of a diamond, gold, and silver chatelaine is that made in 1767 by the French jeweler Jean-François Fistaine for Queen Caroline Mathilda of Denmark.
