Gwich’in, also called Kutchin,  a group of Athabaskan-speaking North American Indian tribes inhabiting the basins of the Yukon and Peel rivers in eastern Alaska and Yukon—a land of coniferous forests interspersed with open, barren ground. The name Gwich’in, meaning “people,” is given collectively to an indefinite number of distinct American Subarctic peoples, there being no precise agreement among authorities on whom to include under this cover name, which is as much linguistic as cultural.
In traditional Gwich’in social organization, men became chiefs by demonstrating leadership or prowess in hunting or war. Men’s major pursuits included battle, fishing, and hunting caribou, moose, and other game. Women’s pursuits included making nearly all household goods, gathering wild plant foods, and transporting their families and material possessions during frequent moves from one camp to another.
