Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke,  (born October 3, 1554, Beauchamp Court, Warwickshire, England—died September 30, 1628, Warwick) English writer who, on his tomb, styled himself “Servant to Q. Eliz., councellor to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney,” but who is best remembered as a powerful philosophical poet and exponent of a plain style of writing.
Greville’s Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney (1652) is a valuable commentary on Elizabethan politics. His sonnet collection Caelica (first printed 1633) differed in tone from most Elizabethan cycles, its treatment being realistic and ironic. His mind was melancholy and Calvinistic, emphasizing the “wearisome condition of humanity,” torn between this world and God’s commands. His tragedies on Oriental themes traced the political results of this division, and his verse treatises showed how statesmen can best keep order in a naughty world. His poem “Humane Learning” was skeptical about the instruments and aims of earthly knowledge and, in stressing practical improvements, probably owed something to his friend Francis Bacon. Greville was a favourite of Queen Elizabeth.
