Neil Young,  (born November 12, 1945, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) Canadian guitarist, singer, and songwriter best known for his eclectic sweep, from solo folkie to grungy guitar-rocker.
Young grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with his mother after her divorce from his father, a well-known Canadian sportswriter. Having performed in bands since his teens and later as a soloist in Toronto coffeehouses, Young was both folkie and rocker, so when he arrived in Los Angeles in 1966 he was ready for Buffalo Springfield, the versatile and pioneering group he joined. His material defied categorization and tested unusual forms and sounds. Fuzztone guitar duels with Stephen Stills offset Young’s high-pitched, nasal vocals; his lyrics veered from skewed romanticism to metaphoric social commentary, but his voice’s naked, quavering vulnerability remained the constant in Young’s turbulent, shape-shifting explorations.
