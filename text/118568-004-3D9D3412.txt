Salomon de Brosse,  (born 1571, Verneuil-sur-Oise, Fr.—died  Dec. 9, 1626, Paris) most influential French architect of the early 17th century, whose works facilitated the development of the classical châteaus designed by the generation that followed him.
De Brosse was born into a family of Protestant architects. He trained under his father and then quickly achieved success on his own. As architect to the queen regent, Marie de Médicis, from 1608, he prepared designs for the Palais du Luxembourg (built c. 1614–30), which featured a rusticated facade influenced by those of Italian Renaissance palazzi. This work and three châteaus—Coulommiers (1613), Montceaux (completed 1615), and especially Blérancourt (completed prior to 1619)—strongly influenced later architects, particularly François Mansart, who worked under de Brosse at Coulommiers.
