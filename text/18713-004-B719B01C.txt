Burlington, county, central New Jersey, U.S., bounded by Pennsylvania to the west (the Delaware River constituting the border) and the mouth of Great Bay in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mullica River to the southeast and south. It consists of a coastal lowland drained by the Bass, Batsto, Mullica, Oswego, and Wading rivers. The county contains the stateâ€™s largest area of timberland (primarily shortleaf pine), which includes Wharton, Penn, Lebanon, and Bass River state forests. Other public facilities are Rancocas State Park and McGuire Air Force Base.
European colonists upon their arrival in the 17th century encountered Algonquian-speaking Delaware Indians. The city of Burlington, settled by Quakers in 1677, was the capital of the West Jersey colony from 1681 and then alternated as provincial capital of New Jersey with Perth Amboy from 1702 to 1790. Another historic Quaker settlement was Mount Holly, the county seat. The city of Bordentown was attacked by British forces in May 1778 during the American Revolution. Batsto Village is a restoration of an 18th- and 19th-century iron-making village. Other communities are Willingboro, Pemberton, Mount Laurel, and Medford.
