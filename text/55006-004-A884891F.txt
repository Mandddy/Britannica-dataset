Growth ring, in a cross section of the stem of a woody plant, the increment of wood added during a single growth period. In temperate regions the growth period is usually one year, in which case the growth ring may be called an “annual ring.” In tropical regions, growth rings may not be discernible or are not annual. Even in temperate regions, growth rings are occasionally missing, and a second, or “false,” ring may be deposited during a single year—for example, following insect defoliation. Growth rings are distinct if conducting cells produced early in the growth period are larger (spring, or early, wood) than those produced later (summer, or late, wood) or if growth is terminated by a layer of relatively thick-walled fibres or by parenchyma. In temperate or cold climates the age of a tree may be determined by counting the number of annual rings at the base of the trunk or, if the trunk is hollow, at the base of a large root. Annual rings have been used in dating ancient wooden structures, especially those of the American Indians in the dry southwestern regions of the United States; fluctuation in ring width is a source of information about ancient climates.
