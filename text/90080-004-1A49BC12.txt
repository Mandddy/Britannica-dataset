Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber of Sydmonton, also called (1992–97) Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber  (born March 22, 1948, London, England) English composer and theatrical producer, whose eclectic rock-based works helped revitalize British and American musical theatre beginning in the late 20th century.
Lloyd Webber studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, and at the Royal College of Music. While a student, he began collaborating with Timothy Rice on dramatic productions, with Rice writing the lyrics to Lloyd Webber’s music. Their first notable venture was Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat (1968), a pop oratorio for children that earned worldwide popularity in a later full-length version. It was followed by the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1971; filmed 1973), an extremely popular though controversial work that blended classical forms with rock music to tell the story of Jesus’ life. That show became the longest-running musical in British theatrical history. Lloyd Webber’s last major collaboration with Rice was on Evita (1978; filmed 1996), a musical about Eva Perón, wife of the Argentine dictator Juan Perón. The Broadway production won seven Tony Awards, including best musical and best score.
