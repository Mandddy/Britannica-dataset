James J. Walker, in full James John Walker, byname Jimmy Walker   (born June 19, 1881, New York City—died  Nov. 18, 1946, New York City) flamboyant mayor of New York City (1925–32), a frequenter of Broadway theatre and the upper-class speakeasies, such as the Central Park Casino. His administration was marred by corruption.
The son of Irish Catholic immigrants who lived in New York’s Greenwich Village, Walker attended Saint Francis Xavier College and graduated from New York Law School in 1904. After graduation, however, he began frequenting Broadway’s theatres and vaudeville, writing popular songs and eventually marrying (in 1912) a musical comedy singer. In that same year he was admitted to the New York State bar.
