Ingrid Betancourt,  (born December 25, 1961, Bogotá, Colombia) Colombian politician whose long captivity as the hostage of Marxist guerrillas and eventual rescue in 2008 made headlines throughout the world. She served as a senator from 1998 to 2002, and, while running for president in the latter year, she was kidnapped.
Betancourt, who holds dual French and Colombian citizenship, spent her formative years in Paris, where her father served for a time as Colombia’s ambassador to UNESCO. She studied at the Institute for Political Studies (Institut d’Études Politiques) and in 1983 married Fabrice Delloye, a French diplomat. She returned to Colombia in 1989 and ran for Congress five years later, winning a seat in the lower house.
