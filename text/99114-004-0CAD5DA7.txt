Arnold Palmer, in full Arnold Daniel Palmer  (born September 10, 1929, Latrobe, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died September 25, 2016, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) professional American golfer who was the first to win the Masters Tournament four times and the first to earn $1 million in tournament prize money. During his professional career (1954–75) he won 92 tournaments, 60 of which were on the Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA) tour. As a leading figure in world golf from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s, he attracted a vast following known as Arnie’s Army.
Palmer, who grew up in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, won the Pennsylvania State High School golf championship twice before attending Wake Forest University on a golf scholarship. After quitting school in 1950, he served in the U.S. Coast Guard. He returned to Wake Forest in 1954 but left again after winning the U.S. Amateur Championship. He turned professional following his U.S. Amateur title and earned his first victory as a professional at the 1955 Canadian Open. In 1958 he won his first Masters Tournament and placed first on the official earnings list for the PGA tour. In 1960 he emerged as a sports superstar, winning eight tournaments, often in dramatic fashion. At the Masters he birdied the last two holes to win by a single stroke, and at the U.S. Open he entered the final round in 15th place but birdied six of the first seven holes en route to victory. That year he also finished in the top five on 19 occasions. His success continued in 1961 as he recorded six victories, including a win at the British Open (Open Championship). In 1962 he prevailed in the first three-way playoff in Masters’ history to win his third championship at Augusta. That same year Palmer captured his second consecutive British Open with a four-round total of 276, which was two strokes better than the tournament’s previous record. In 1964 he won his fourth Masters Tournament with a four-round total of 276, the second lowest score in the Masters up to that time. Palmer joined the Senior PGA Tour (later renamed the Champions Tour) on its founding in 1980, and he retired from competitive golf in 2006.
