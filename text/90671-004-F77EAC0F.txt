The Public Enemy, American gangster film, released in 1931, that became a classic and propelled its lead, James Cagney, to stardom.
The story traces the life of an impoverished young man, Tom Powers (played by Cagney), as he escalates from being a petty criminal to heading a murderous bootlegging ring. Although he achieves tremendous power, he is haunted by family conflicts and a sense of overconfidence that ultimately ends in tragedy. Jean Harlow played the small but memorable role of Cagneyâ€™s glamorous moll.
