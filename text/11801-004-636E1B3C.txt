Anthony Herman Gerard Fokker,  (born April 6, 1890, Kediri, Java, Netherlands East Indies [now Indonesia]â€”died Dec. 23, 1939, New York City, N.Y., U.S.) Dutch airman and pioneer aircraft manufacturer who during World War I produced more than 40 types of airplanes (designed by Reinhold Platz) for the German High Command. Initially he offered his designs to both combatants, but the Allies turned him down.
Fokker built his first plane in 1910 and taught himself to fly. In 1912 he established a small aircraft factory at Johannisthal, near Berlin. During World War I he introduced the gear system that made it possible to fire a machine gun through the propeller arc without hitting the blades; the propeller itself, by means of levers and gears, operated the gun at properly timed intervals.
