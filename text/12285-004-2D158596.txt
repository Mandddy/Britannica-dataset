Arnold Dolmetsch,  (born Feb. 24, 1858, Le Mans, Fr.—died  Feb. 28, 1940, Haslemere, Surrey, Eng.) French-born British musician whose lifework, pursued in the face of prolonged indifference and misunderstanding, established the modern search for authenticity in the performance and instrumentation of early music. His craftsmanship in restoring and reproducing early musical instruments, his insistence on consultation of source material, coupled with his intuitive understanding, gave him remarkable insight into the problems of presenting music of J.S. Bach’s generation and earlier.
Dolmetsch learned piano and organ building from his father and grandfather, and, after study at the Brussels Conservatory and the Royal College of Music in London, he taught violin. He discovered British Museum manuscripts of viol music by early English composers, began investigating how to perform their music in authentic style, and in 1890 gave his first viol concert.
