Condor, either of two large New World vultures—the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus)—that are two of the largest flying birds. Wingspans of up to 3.2 metres (10.5 feet) have been reported for male Andean condors, and adult California condors typically reach 2.9 metres (9.5 feet). From beak to tail, the body of each is about 1.2 metres (4 feet) long. Male Andean Condors may weigh up to 15 kg (33 pounds), and female Andean and both sexes of California condors may reach 11 kg (24 pounds) in weight.
The male Andean condor is a black bird with grayish white wing feathers, a white fringe of feathers around the neck, and a bare red or pinkish head, neck, and crop. Males have a large caruncle, or fleshy protuberance, on the forehead and top of the beak, and turkeylike neck wattles. The species ranges throughout the Andes Mountains of South America, frequenting open country and feeding on carcasses. In Peru and Chile it descends to the Pacific Coast, where it feeds on dead marine animals such as seals and fish. Andean condors are rare in northern South America but still relatively common in the southern part of their range. They breed every other year unless the hatchling dies, in which case the pair breeds again the following year. The young are raised on remote ledges and in caves at altitudes above 3,000 metres (10,000 feet), using no nesting material. The white egg measures about 12 cm (4.5 inches) long.
