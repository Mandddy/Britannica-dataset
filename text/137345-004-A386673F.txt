Torrent duck,  (species Merganetta armata), long-bodied duck, found along rushing mountain streams in the Andes. It is usually classified as an aberrant dabbling duck but is sometimes placed in its own tribe, the Merganettini, family Anatidae (order Anseriformes). The torrent duck clings to slippery stones with its stiff tail or dives to probe beneath rocks with its narrow soft bill for insect larvae. All races show sex differences in plumage; drakes are white headed, with black eye and neck stripes, and are gray to black below, while hens are rusty and dark gray. All have a spur at the wing bend, as do many perching ducks.
