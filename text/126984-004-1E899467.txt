Tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus), also called Central American mud-puddle frog,  terrestrial, toadlike frog common in moist, lowland sites from Mexico to northern South America.
The frog is cryptically coloured, its rough brown skin matching the leaf litter in which it lives. Although a mere 25–35 mm (1–1.4 inches) in length, this small amphibian consumes a wide range of insects; unlike many frogs of its size, it does not specifically feed on ants.
