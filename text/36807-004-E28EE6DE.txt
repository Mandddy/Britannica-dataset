Mesia, also called Silver-eared Mesia, or Silver-ear,   (species Leiothrix argentauris), songbird of the babbler family Timaliidae (order Passeriformes). It is found from Pakistan through the Indochinese peninsula in scrub and secondary jungle. This 15-centimetre- (6-inch-) long bird is olive above and yellow below, with a black crown, silver ear patches, and some crimson on the tail. In groups of 6 to 30 it travels about the forest bushes and canopy seeking berries and peering under leaves for insects. Four eggs are laid in a cup-shaped nest. The mesia has a sweet, whistling song and is sometimes kept as a cage bird.
