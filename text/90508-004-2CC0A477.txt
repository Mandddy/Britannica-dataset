All Quiet on the Western Front, novel by German-American writer Erich Maria Remarque, published in 1929 as Im Westen nichts Neues. An antiwar novel set during World War I, it was written after the war and reflects the disillusionment of the period. The book is an account of a young man’s experiences in battle and of his short career as a soldier. It details the daily routine of soldiers who seem to have no past or future apart from their life in the trenches. Its title, the language of routine communiqués, is typical of its cool, terse style, which records the daily horrors of war in laconic understatement. Its casual amorality was in shocking contrast to patriotic rhetoric. The book was an immediate international success.
