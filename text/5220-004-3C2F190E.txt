Wormwood, any bitter or aromatic herb or shrub of the genus Artemisia of the family Asteraceae, distributed throughout many parts of the world. These plants have many small, greenish yellow flower heads grouped in clusters. The leaves are usually divided and alternate along the stem; they may be green, grayish green, or silvery white.
The leaves of the common wormwood (A. absinthium), probably the best-known species, have been used in medicines and such beverages as absinthe. Common wormwood is native to Europe but has become naturalized in Canada and the United States. The leaves of the tarragon (A. dracunculus), another well-known species, are employed as a seasoning, and those of the mugwort (A. vulgaris) are often used to flavour beverages.
