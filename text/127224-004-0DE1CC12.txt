Lindsey Vonn, née Lindsey Kildow  (born October 18, 1984, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.) American Alpine skier who won four women’s World Cup overall championships (2008–10 and 2012) and is the all-time leader in World Cup race victories.
Kildow burst onto the international skiing scene in 1999 at age 14 when she won the slalom race at Italy’s Trofeo Topolino competition for skiers aged 11–14, becoming the first American female to capture the event. She skied in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, racing in Alpine combined and slalom, but she managed only a sixth-place finish in combined. She won a silver medal in downhill at the 2003 Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) junior world ski championships and again took silver in downhill one year later at the U.S. championships.
