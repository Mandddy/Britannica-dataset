Farouk I, also spelled Faruk, Arabic Fārūq al-Awwal   (born Feb. 11, 1920, Cairo, Egypt—died  March 18, 1965, Rome, Italy) king of Egypt from 1936 to 1952. Although initially quite popular, the internal rivalries of his administration and his alienation of the military—coupled with his increasing excesses and eccentricities—led to his downfall and to the formation of a republic.
Farouk, the son and successor of King Fuʾād I, was educated in Egypt and England before ascending the throne in 1936. As king he continued his father’s rivalry with the popular-based Wafd party, with which he clashed over many issues, including administrative functions, appointments, and even the form used for his coronation.
