Cee Lo Green, byname of Thomas Callaway, original name Thomas DeCarlo Burton, also known as Cee-Lo  (born May 30, 1974, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.) American singer, rapper, and songwriter known for his soulful voice and flamboyant persona, both as a solo performer and as part of the rap group Goodie Mob and the eclectic duo Gnarls Barkley.
He was born Thomas Burton and grew up in Atlanta as the son of two ordained Baptist ministers, both of whom died when he was young; sometime after his father’s death, he assumed his mother’s maiden name, Callaway. As an adolescent, he engaged in gang activity and committed petty theft, and, after dropping out of school in the ninth grade, he was sent to a military academy, where he eventually earned a GED. Having early displayed an affinity for music—he sang in his church and played the piano at home—by his late teenage years he sought to pursue it as a career.
