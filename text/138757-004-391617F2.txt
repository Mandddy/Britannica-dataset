Hawkesbury River,  river rising in the Great Dividing Range north of Lake George, New South Wales, Australia, and flowing 293 miles (472 km) north and east to the Tasman Sea at Broken Bay. It drains an area of about 8,390 square miles (21,730 square km). Known as the Wollondilly in its rugged upper course and as the Warragamba after receiving the Nattai and, later, the Nepean rivers, it becomes the Hawkesbury after its junction with the Grose. It then continues on a meandering course for 100 miles (160 km), becoming a salt tidal stream after receiving the Colo River. Riparian towns include Camden, Penrith, and Windsor, and there are many scenic valley resorts. The riverâ€™s fertile alluvial flats are subject to floods. Explored in 1789 by Captain Arthur Phillip, first governor of the Australian colony, it was named for Baron Hawkesbury (later 2nd Earl of Liverpool).
