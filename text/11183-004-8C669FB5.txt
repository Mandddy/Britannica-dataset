Hatchetfish,  any member of two unrelated groups of hatchet-shaped fishes—deep-sea forms of the family Sternoptychidae or freshwater fishes of the family Gasteropelecidae.
Deep-sea hatchetfishes are small, shining silver fishes. They are abundant in warm and temperate regions throughout the world, usually at depths of about 200–1,000 m (650–3,000 feet). Deep-bodied and flattened from side to side, they have slender tails and rows of light organs along the lower edge of each side of the body. The eyes are large and in the genus Argyropelecus are mounted on tubes pointed upward. Of about 15 species of sternoptychids, none exceeds a length of 10 cm (4 inches). The fishes are carnivorous.
