Molly Picon,  (born June 1, 1898, New York, New York, U.S.—died April 6, 1992, Lancaster, Pennsylvania) American actress and singer, the “Sweetheart of Second Avenue” in Yiddish theatre in New York City during the 1920s and ’30s, who was known for her impish charm and comedic talents, notably in such productions as Yankele, Raizele, Oy, iz dos a meydl! (“Oh, what a girl!”), and Hello Molly.
A child star, Picon first appeared in vaudeville (1904) before joining a Yiddish theatre managed by playwright Jacob Kalich (1919). Picon and Kalich married in 1919 and toured Europe in 1921 so that she could perfect her Yiddish. After returning to the United States, she starred in more than 200 Yiddish productions, performing comic renditions of “The Working Goil” and “The Story of Grandma’s Shawl.” She made her Broadway debut in Morning Star (1940), her first English-speaking starring role, and then toured internationally during World War II. She earned critical acclaim in London opposite Robert Morley in the comedy A Majority of One. As Yiddish theatre declined, she accepted more mainstream stage and film roles. She played an American widow searching for a husband in Israel in the Broadway musical Milk and Honey (1961). Her film credits include Yiddle with His Fiddle (1937), Mamele (“Little Mother”; 1938), Come Blow Your Horn (1963), and Fiddler on the Roof (1971). A Jewish theatre was named for her in 1931. She continued to perform into her 80s.
