Gus Van Sant, in full Gus Greene Van Sant, Jr.  (born July 24, 1952, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.) American film director and writer, known for focusing on marginalized and isolated characters.
The son of a traveling businessman and a housewife, Van Sant lived an itinerant childhood. He began making amateur films in high school, and he later studied film at the Rhode Island School of Design (B.A., 1975). His early releases were short films, notably The Discipline of D.E. (1982), an adaptation of a William S. Burroughs short story. Mala Noche (1985), his first feature-length film, centres on a drugstore clerk obsessed with a young Mexican immigrant. The theme of homosexual love apparent in the story would manifest with varying degrees of subtlety in many of Van Santâ€™s later films.
