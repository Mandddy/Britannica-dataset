Risshō-Kōsei-kai,  (Japanese: “Society for Establishing Righteousness and Friendly Relations”), lay religious group in Japan based on the teachings of the Nichiren school of Buddhism. The Risshō-Kōsei-kai is an offshoot of the Reiyū-kai, from which it separated in 1938. It was founded by Niwano Nikkyō, a milk dealer, who became its leader, and a devout housewife, Naganuma Myōkō, who died in 1957. Like other sects that follow the teachings of Nichiren, it emphasizes devotion to the Lotus Sūtra and the efficacy of chanting its name. Daily services in the Tokyo headquarters of the sect are attended by up to 10,000 people who chant in unison. This service is followed by daily hōza, or group counseling sessions, in which the application of faith to the problems of daily life is stressed.
