Yeoman warder, also known as Beefeater,  the official guardian of the Tower of London. The office of yeoman warder has existed since the Tower was constructed in the 11th century; it is one of the oldest such offices in the world (compare Swiss Guards). In early times yeoman warders were charged with guarding the Towerâ€™s typically prestigious prisoners and assisting in their punishment, which often involved torture.
Contemporary yeoman warders act as historians and guides in the Tower of London. Prior to being named a yeoman warder, a candidate must have served a minimum of 22 years in the British Army, the Royal Marines, or the Royal Air Force and must have achieved the rank of senior noncommissioned officer. All Yeoman Warders (and their families) live in the Tower so that warders may attend to duties at any time of the day or night. The first female yeoman warder was installed in 2007.
