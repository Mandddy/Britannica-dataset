Lou Gehrig, in full Henry Louis Gehrig, original name Ludwig Heinrich Gehrig, byname the Iron Horse  (born June 19, 1903, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 2, 1941, New York City) one of the most durable players in American professional baseball and one of its great hitters. From June 1, 1925, to May 2, 1939, Gehrig, playing first base for the New York Yankees, appeared in 2,130 consecutive games, a record that stood until it was broken on September 6, 1995, by Cal Ripken, Jr., of the Baltimore Orioles. A quiet, gentle man, Gehrig was somewhat overshadowed by his colourful teammate Babe Ruth, whom he followed in the Yankees’ batting order.
Gehrig attended Columbia University before joining the Yankees organization. In each of seven major league seasons, he batted in 150 or more runs, and in 1931 he established the American League record of 184 runs in a season. On June 3, 1932, he hit four consecutive home runs in one game, becoming the first player of the 20th century to do so. In 1934 he achieved the “Triple Crown” of baseball, leading his league in batting average (.363), home runs (49), and runs batted in (RBIs; 165). He hit 49 home runs again in 1936.
