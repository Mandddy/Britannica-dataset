Oilbird (Steatornis caripensis), also called guácharo,  nocturnal bird of South America that lives in caves and feeds on fruit, mainly the nuts of oil palms. The oilbird is an aberrant member of the order Caprimulgiformes; it comprises the family Steatornithidae. About 30 centimetres (12 inches) long, with fanlike tail and long broad wings, it is dark reddish brown, barred with black and spotted with white. It has a strong hook-tipped bill, long bristles around the wide gape, and large dark eyes.
The oilbird uses echolocation, like a bat, to find its way within the caves where it roosts and nests from Trinidad and Guyana to Bolivia. The sounds the bird emits are within the range of human hearing: bursts of astonishingly rapid clicks (as many as 250 per second). It also utters hair-raising squawks and shrieks that suggested its Spanish name, guácharo (“wailer”). At night it flies out to feed, hovering while it plucks fruit from trees.
