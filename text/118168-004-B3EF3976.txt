International Committee of the Red Cross , (ICRC), French Comité International de la Croix-Rouge,  international nongovernmental organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, that seeks to aid victims of war and to ensure the observance of humanitarian law by all parties in conflict. The work of the ICRC in both World Wars was recognized by the Nobel Prize for Peace in both 1917 and 1944. It shared another Nobel Peace Prize with the League of Red Cross Societies in 1963, the year of the 100th anniversary of the ICRC’s founding.
The International Committee of the Red Cross was formed in response to the experiences of its founder, Jean-Henri Dunant, at the Battle of Solferino in 1859. Dunant witnessed thousands of wounded soldiers left to die for lack of adequate medical services. Soliciting help from neighbouring civilians, Dunant organized care for the soldiers. In 1862 he published an account of the situation at Solferino; by 1863 he had garnered so much support that the Geneva Society for Public Welfare helped found the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded. In 1875 this organization became the International Committee of the Red Cross.
