Harold H. Burton, in full Harold Hitz Burton  (born June 22, 1888, Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, U.S.—died October 28, 1964, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1945–58).
Burton was the son of Alfred E. Burton, a dean and professor of civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Gertrude Hitz Burton. He graduated from Bowdoin College (where he also played quarterback for the football team) in 1909 and received a law degree from Harvard in 1912. That year he married Selma Florence Smith and was admitted to the bar, whereupon he secured employment in the law office of his wife’s uncle in Cleveland, Ohio, a city that had been headed (1901–09) by Burton’s idol, reform mayor Tom L. Johnson. Burton practiced law in Cleveland for two years before moving to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he practiced law until 1914. His experience in Salt Lake City led to further corporate law opportunities in Boise, Idaho, where he worked as counsel for a public utility.
