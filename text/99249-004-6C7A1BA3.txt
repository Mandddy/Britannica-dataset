Hooded seal (Cystophora cristata), also called bladdernose seal,  large grayish seal with dark spots that is found in open waters of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. Hooded seals range from the Svalbard archipelago and the Barents Sea to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Average-sized adult males measure about 2.6 metres (8.5 feet) long and typically weigh between 300 and 400 kg (660 and 880 pounds), whereas average-sized females measure 2.2 metres (7 feet) and weigh between 160 and 230 kg (350 and 500 pounds). Hooded seals are named for the nasal ornamentation occurring in sexually mature males. Hanging like a wrinkled sac when relaxed, the appendage can be inflated to become a hood that covers the front of the face and the top of the head. Adult males also have an elastic nasal septum that can be inflated to become a reddish balloon in front of their face. These two unusual features have a role in attracting females and, when competing for females, advertising strength to other males.
Hooded seals are gregarious only during molting and breeding season. Breeding typically occurs between April and June, and pups are born on the pack ice during the following March and April. Pups weigh roughly 25 kg (55 pounds) at birth and already possess a thin layer of blubber. Their coloration is gray on the belly, with darker, almost bluish fur on their back. For this reason they are often referred to as “bluebacks.” Lactation lasts only four days, and pups drink 10 litres (2.6 gallons) of milk daily to gain 7 kg (15 pounds) per day during that period. Weaned pups weigh up to 60 kg (130 pounds). After weaning, pups fast for several weeks until hunger drives them to enter the water and start feeding on their own. Females reach sexual maturity between three and six years of age, whereas males become sexually mature between five and seven years of age. Hooded seals may live for 25–30 years.
