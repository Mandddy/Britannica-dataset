Thomas Pennant,  (born June 14, 1726, Downing, Flintshire, Wales—died  Dec. 16, 1798, Downing) Welsh naturalist and traveler, one of the foremost zoologists of his time.
Pennant was a landowner of independent means. His books were valued for their highly readable treatment of the existing knowledge of natural history. His volume on British Zoology (1766) stimulated zoological research, particularly in ornithology, in Great Britain, and his History of Quadrupeds (1781) and Arctic Zoology, 2 vol. (1784–85), were also widely read. His travel books presented valuable information on the local customs, natural history, and antiquities of Scotland, Wales, England, and the European continent.
