Pius VI, original name Giannangelo Braschi   (born December 25, 1717, Cesena, Papal States—died August 29, 1799, Valence, France) Italian pope (1775–99) whose tragic pontificate was the longest of the 18th century.
Braschi held various papal administrative positions before being ordained a priest in 1758. Progressing rapidly, he became treasurer of the apostolic chamber in 1766, under Pope Clement XIII, and in 1773 was made cardinal by Pope Clement XIV, after whose death a four-month conclave elected Braschi on February 15, 1775.
