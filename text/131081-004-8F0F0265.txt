Drum, also called croaker,  in biology, any of about 275 species of fishes of the family Sciaenidae (order Perciformes); drums are carnivorous, generally bottom-dwelling fishes. Most are marine, found along warm and tropical seashores. A number inhabit temperate or fresh waters. Most are noisemakers and can “vocalize” by moving strong muscles attached to the air bladder, which acts as a resonating chamber, amplifying the sounds.
Drums have two dorsal fins and are usually silvery in colour. The weakfishes, seatrouts, and squeteagues (Cynoscion) have large mouths, jutting lower jaws, and canine teeth, but most drums have underslung lower jaws and small teeth. Some have whiskerlike barbels on the chin. The largest member of the family, weighing up to 100 kg (225 pounds), is the totuava (Totoaba macdonaldi) of the Gulf of California; most other species are much smaller.
