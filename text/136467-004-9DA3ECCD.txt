Tujia, Wade-Giles romanization Tâ€™u-chia, self-designation Bizika,  any member of a people distributed over western Hunan and southwestern Hubei provinces in China. The Tujia numbered more than eight million in the early 21st century. Their language, which remains unwritten and is spoken by only a few hundred thousand of the total population, belongs to the Tibeto-Burman group of Sino-Tibetan languages, and, two dialects, northern and southern, are often distinguished. Most Tujia, however, speak and write Chinese, and, many also understand the language of the neighbouring Miao people, to whom they are related. Like the Miao, the Tujia grow corn (maize) on small terraced fields in the foothills and narrow valleys of their homeland. They also cultivate beets, ramie, cotton, tea oil, tea, and tung oil, and sell tung oil and medicinal herbs. They are noted for their handicrafts, particularly weaving and embroidery, and for several traditional dances, especially a hand dance in which some 70 hand gestures are used to describe daily life. The Tujia are known to have been a distinct group as early as the 10th century ad.
