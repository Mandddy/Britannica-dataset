Max Ophüls, original name Max Oppenheimer  (born May 6, 1902, Saarbrücken, Germany—died March 26, 1957, Hamburg, West Germany) German motion-picture director whose mastery of fluid camera movement gave his films a characteristic lyrical flow. He was one of the first truly international directors, sensitive to national differences and to the human qualities common to all his characters.
Ophüls was an actor, stage director, and producer in Germany and Austria from 1921 to 1930. He was a veteran of some 200 plays by the time he began work in films in 1929. His first important films were Die verkaufte Braut (1932; The Bartered Bride), regarded as one of the best film adaptations of an opera, and Liebelei (1932; “Love Affair”), a bittersweet love story set in Vienna. Both films included several of Ophüls’s trademark elements: lavish settings fitted with ornate and glistening decor, elaborate camera movement, a strong female protagonist, the use of musical motifs, and mise-en-scènes composed in a unique parallel manner. After Leibelei, Ophüls, cognizant of the growing influence of the Nazis, left Germany and directed popular but undistinguished films in France, Russia, Italy, and the Netherlands until 1940. He became a French citizen in 1938 and moved to the United States in 1940 after again fleeing the Nazis.
