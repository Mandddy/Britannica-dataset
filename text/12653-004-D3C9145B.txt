François Coty,  (born May 3, 1874, Ajaccio, Corsica—died  July 25, 1934, Louveciennes, Fr.) French perfume manufacturer who acquired newspaper interests to advance his right-wing political and social views.
By 1900 Coty’s small perfume business had become highly successful. In 1905 he opened a plant near Paris and during World War I became one of the wealthiest men in France. He gained control in 1922 of Le Figaro, a conservative Paris daily. To check the growth of French Socialism and Communism, he founded two other daily papers in 1928. Subsidized by the perfume business, both papers sold at half the price of other dailies and enjoyed wide circulation. In later years his wealth was much reduced.
