Céline Dion, in full Céline Marie Claudette Dion  (born March 30, 1968, Charlemagne, Quebec, Canada) French Canadian pop singer, known for her vocal prowess and her passionate showmanship, who achieved international superstardom in the 1990s. Working primarily in the pop ballad tradition, she recorded numerous hit albums in both French and English and was the recipient of several prestigious awards.
The youngest of 14 children raised in a small town near Montreal, Dion began singing with her musically inclined family when she was five years old. At age 12 she came to the attention of impresario René Angélil—whom she eventually married in 1994—and he launched her career with the album La Voix du bon Dieu (1981; “The Voice of God”). Dion subsequently won an award at the World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo in 1982, and the following year she received the first of many Félix awards (for musicians from Quebec). Also in 1983 she became the first Canadian recipient of a gold record in France. Invited to represent Switzerland at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1988, Dion won with her performance of “Ne partez pas sans moi” (“Do Not Leave Without Me”). By the end of the 1980s, she had recorded eight studio albums in French. As she transitioned into adulthood, she shed her image as a winsome naïf in favour of a more worldly look and sound.
