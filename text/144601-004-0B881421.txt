Susan Sarandon, original name Susan Abigail Tomalin  (born October 4, 1946, New York, New York, U.S.) American film actress who transcended the early roles of her career, in which she often played characters who were highly sensual but little else, to become a performer of considerable versatility and emotional depth. In 1996 she won an Academy Award for her unglamorous yet engaging performance as a nun counseling death-row prisoners in Dead Man Walking (1995).
After graduating with a degree in drama from Catholic University of America (B.A., 1968) in Washington, D.C., Sarandon worked as a model and appeared in small film roles and television work, notably in the soap opera A World Apart. In 1975 she shined as the ingenue in the cult favourite The Rocky Horror Picture Show and starred opposite Robert Redford in The Great Waldo Pepper.
