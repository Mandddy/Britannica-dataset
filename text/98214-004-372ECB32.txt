Tibetan terrier, also called Dhokhi apso ,  breed of nonsporting dog that originated in Tibet to aid shepherds. It was believed to bring luck to its owner. The name terrier was adopted in reference to the dogâ€™s size; unlike other dogs called terriers it was not bred to dig for game. Its profuse double coat is very thick and fine and may be straight or wavy, appearing in any colour or combination of colours. The Tibetan terrier has dark brown eyes that are covered by a fall of long hair. Its feet are large and flat, producing a snowshoe effect that provides traction. Its tail curls over its back. Medium-sized, it stands 14 to 17 inches (36 to 43 cm) and weighs 18 to 30 pounds (8 to 14 kg). Tibetan terriers are noted for their intelligence and devotion to their owners.
