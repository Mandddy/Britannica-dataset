Colossal order, also called Giant Order,  architectural order extending beyond one interior story, often extending through several stories. Though giant columns were used in antiquity, they were first applied to building facades in Renaissance Italy. Any of the orders (the major types being Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite) could be treated in this manner. The colossal order was revived in 18th-century Europe, notably in England in the grandly theatrical classicism of Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor. See also order.
