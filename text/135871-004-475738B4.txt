Alison Krauss ,  (born July 23, 1971, Champaign, Illinois, U.S.) American bluegrass fiddler and singer who—alone and in collaboration with her band, Union Station—performed folk, gospel, country, pop, and rock songs in the unamplified bluegrass style and played a major role in the early 21st-century revival of interest in bluegrass music.
Krauss began studying classical violin at age five but proved to be a bluegrass prodigy. A flamboyant fiddler, she won several contests, led a band when she was 10, won the Illinois State Fiddling Championship two years later, and signed a recording contract at age 14. In 1990 she won a Grammy Award for her third album, I’ve Got That Old Feeling. Krauss’s first incarnation of Union Station included her bass-playing older brother, Viktor, who later joined Lyle Lovett’s backing band. As Union Station evolved and changed, Krauss’s soprano singing became a primary element in its success. By 1995 the ensemble was a leading bluegrass act with the breakthrough album Now That I’ve Found You and the hit single “When You Say Nothing at All.” Each of Krauss’s successive efforts became best sellers as well, and her performances on the sound tracks for the films O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) and Cold Mountain (2003) helped to introduce bluegrass to a new audience.
