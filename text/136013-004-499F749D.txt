Gray mold rot, also called gray mold blight or botrytis blight,  disease of plants growing in humid areas that is caused by fungi in the genus Botrytis, usually B. cinerea. The disease primarily affects flowers and buds, though infections on fruits, leaves, and stems can occur. Most vegetables, fruits, flowers, and woody plants are susceptible. Gray mold rot is characterized by soft, tan to brown spots or blotches that become covered with a dusty mold and can cause seedlings, young shoots, and leaves to wither and collapse and buds, flowers, and fruits to become flecked and rotten.
Control involves the removal of infected parts. Proper cultivation, including spacing for ventilation, judicious fertilizing, and watering at the soil line, is helpful in reducing the chances of gray mold rot. Harvested fruits and vegetables should be stored as close to 0 °C (32 °F) as is practical and sprayed with a fungicide at least weekly in damp cool weather.
