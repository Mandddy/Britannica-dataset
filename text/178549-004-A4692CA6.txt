John Henry Patterson,  (born December 13, 1844, near Dayton, Ohio, U.S.â€”died May 7, 1922, near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) American manufacturer who helped popularize the modern cash register by means of aggressive and innovative sales techniques.
Patterson began his career as a toll collector for the Miami &amp; Erie Canal and then went into business selling coal with his brother. Convinced that petty pilfering by clerks was cheating him of profits, he bought three new machines called cash registers, invented in 1879 by a Dayton tavern owner, James Ritty. The store eventually showed a profit, and Patterson bought Ritty out and renamed the firm the National Cash Register Company, later to be known familiarly as NCR.
