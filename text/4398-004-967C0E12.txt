Sprint,  in bicycle racing, a competition over a 1,000-metre (1,094-yard) course (500-metre for women) with time taken only over the last 200 metres (219 yards).
Racers compete in groups of two (sometimes called a match sprint) or three, and they frequently spend the early laps of the race moving relatively slowly and trying to manoeuvre their opponents into the lead, while at the same time following close behind and conserving energy for the final high-speed dash to the finish line. Olympic medals are awarded in the individual sprints for men (from 1896) and for women (from 1988).
