Piero della Francesca, original name Piero di Benedetto dei Franceschi  (born c. 1416/17, Sansepolcro, Republic of Florence [Italy]—died October 12, 1492, Sansepolcro) painter whose serene, disciplined exploration of perspective had little influence on his contemporaries but came to be recognized in the 20th century as a major contribution to the Italian Renaissance. The fresco cycle The Legend of the True Cross (1452–66) and the diptych portrait of Federico da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, and his consort (1465) are among his best-known works.
The documented facts of Piero della Francesca’s life, which are few, permit a reasonably accurate reconstruction of his career and interests but not an exact chronology of his surviving paintings. His father, Benedetto de’ Franceschi, was apparently a tanner and shoemaker, prosperous enough for his son to become well educated and literate in Latin. Nothing is known about Piero’s early training as a painter, though it is assumed that he was instructed by local masters who had been influenced by Sienese art.
