Mountain ecosystem, complex of living organisms in mountainous areas.
Mountain lands provide a scattered but diverse array of habitats in which a large range of plants and animals can be found. At higher altitudes harsh environmental conditions generally prevail, and a treeless alpine vegetation, upon which the present account is focused, is supported. Lower slopes commonly are covered by montane forests. At even lower levels mountain lands grade into other types of landform and vegetationâ€”e.g., tropical or temperate forest, savanna, scrubland, desert, or tundra.
