Houseplant, any plant adapted for growing indoors. The most common are exotic plants native to warm, frost-free parts of the world that can be grown indoors in colder climates in portable containers or miniature gardens. Most houseplants are, therefore, derived from plants native to the tropics and near tropics. Those that make the best indoor subjects are the species that adjust comfortably to the rather warm, dry conditions that generally prevail in indoor living spaces.
Although many plants can be grown successfully indoors, there are certain groups that, because of their attractiveness and relative ease of maintenance, are generally considered the best houseplants. These include the aroids, bromeliads, succulents (including cacti), ferns, begonias, and palms, all of which have long been favourites. Somewhat more demanding are those that are grown primarily for their flowersâ€”African violets, camellias, gardenias, geraniums (Pelargonium species), and orchids.
