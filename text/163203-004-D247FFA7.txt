Samuel A. Alito, Jr., in full Samuel Anthony Alito, Jr.  (born April 1, 1950, Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.) associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 2006.
Alito earned a bachelor’s degree (1972) from Princeton University and a law degree (1975) from Yale University, where he served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal. In the Republican administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, he served as assistant to the U.S. solicitor general (1981–85), deputy assistant to the U.S. attorney general (1985–87), and U.S. attorney for the district of New Jersey (1987–90). During his time in the attorney general’s office, Alito argued several cases before the Supreme Court. In 1990 he was appointed by Bush to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. His judicial philosophy was generally considered conservative—many referred to him by the nickname “Scalito,” a reference to similarities with conservative associate justice Antonin Scalia. Alito voted in favour of restrictions on abortion rights and in favour of the right of local governments to display religious symbols (such as a nativity scene) during holidays and voted against federal gun-control legislation. In 2005 he was appointed associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by President George W. Bush to fill the seat of retiring justice Sandra Day O’Connor; he was confirmed (58–42) by the U.S. Senate the following year.
