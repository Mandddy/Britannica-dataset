William Holmes McGuffey,  (born September 23, 1800, Washington county, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 4, 1873, Charlottesville, Virginia) U.S. educator who is remembered chiefly for his series of elementary school reading books popularly known as the McGuffey Readers.
With little formal education, McGuffey mastered the school arts and began teaching in the Ohio frontier schools at the age of 14. While teaching, he continued his own education intermittently—under private tutors, at Greersburg Academy, and as a student of philosophy and language at Washington (Pennsylvania) College. During his 10 years (from 1826) on the faculty of Miami University, Oxford, Ohio, McGuffey took great interest in public education and assisted the teachers of the local elementary schools. In his own home he established a model school for neighbourhood children.
