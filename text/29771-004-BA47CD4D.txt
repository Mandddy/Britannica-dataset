George Nicoll Barnes,  (born Jan. 2, 1859, Dundee, Scot.—died  April 21, 1940, London, Eng.) trade-union leader, socialist, a founder (1900) and chairman (1910) of the British Labour Party, and member of David Lloyd George’s coalition ministry during World War I.
A clerk in a jute mill at the age of 11, Barnes later became an engineer and was assistant secretary (1892–96) and general secretary (1896–1908) of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He led a nationwide strike (July 1897–January 1898) of the engineers, at that time the strongest labour union in Great Britain. Although forced to capitulate in its demands for an eight-hour working day, the union established the principle of collective bargaining over employment conditions.
