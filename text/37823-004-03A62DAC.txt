Igor Moiseyev, in full Igor Aleksandrovich Moiseyev  (born Jan. 21 [Jan. 8, Old Style], 1906, Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empireâ€”died Nov. 2, 2007, Moscow, Russia) Russian choreographer and founder of the State Academic Folk Dance Ensemble of the U.S.S.R. (Gosudarstvenny Akademichesky Ansambl Narodnogo Tantsa S.S.S.R.), popularly called the Moiseyev Ensemble (Ansambl Moiseyeva). He re-created for theatrical presentation numerous national dances of the Soviet Union.
Trained in Moscow by the Bolshoi ballet school, from which he graduated in 1924, Moiseyev was admired both as a character dancer and as a choreographer at the Bolshoi Theatre. In 1936 he was appointed head of the choreography department of the newly established Theatre of Folk Art in Moscow. After organizing a national folk dance festival, he founded (1937) the State Academic Folk Dance Ensemble, which featured 35 dancers, principally amateurs, and dances from the 11 republics then forming the U.S.S.R. Subsequently he built a company of about 100 professional dancers trained by either the Bolshoi Theatre School or its National Dance Department, which Moiseyev headed; all ensemble dancers have background in classical ballet.
