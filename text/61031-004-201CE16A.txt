Yamoussoukro Basilica, in full Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro Basilica,  Roman Catholic basilica in Yamoussoukro, Côte d’Ivoire, that is the largest Christian church in the world. The basilica’s rapid construction in 1986–89 was ostensibly paid for by Côte d’Ivoire’s president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, and the building is situated in his birthplace, the city of Yamoussoukro. The basilica’s form is roughly based on that of Saint Peter’s in Rome, with a dome surmounting a colonnade that is in the form of a Latin cross. The basilica is fronted by a large plaza encircled by two more colonnades. The 272 Doric columns that support the colonnades are made of cement and rise as high as 101 feet (31 metres). The basilica’s gigantic dome dwarfs that of Saint Peter’s and rises to a height of 489 feet (149 metres). The basilica has the capacity to hold 18,000 worshipers, while the esplanade can accommodate a crowd of 300,000.
