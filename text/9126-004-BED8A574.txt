Lorado Taft,  (born April 29, 1860, Elmwood, Illinois, U.S.—died October 30, 1936, Chicago) American sculptor of portrait busts and monumental, allegorical works. He was also an influential teacher and writer.
Taft graduated from the University of Illinois in Champaign and from 1880 to 1883 attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he received a conservative, traditional art education with an emphasis on mythological and literary subjects. Although Taft began his career as a sculptor of portrait busts and monuments dedicated to soldiers, his best- known work consists largely of gracefully idealized, allegorical figures—e.g., Fountain of the Great Lakes (1913; Art Institute of Chicago) and The Fountain of Time (1922; Washington Park, Chicago).
