Belmont Stakes, oldest and longest of the three classic horse races (with the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes) that constitute the Triple Crown of American horse racing. The Belmont Stakes originated in 1867 and is named after the financier, diplomat, and sportsman August Belmont. It has been run at various distances and tracks in its history. Since 1905, however, it has been held at Belmont Park, near New York City, and the course has been 1.5 miles (about 2,400 metres) in length since 1926. The race is held early in June and is the final race of the Triple Crown.
The Belmont has come to be known as the “Test of the Champion” by horse-racing professionals. By the time the race is run, the three-year-old Thoroughbred horses that compete in it have fully matured, and the field of competitors has been weeded out so that only the very best of the crop compete, which is why the field is usually the smallest of the three Triple Crown races.
