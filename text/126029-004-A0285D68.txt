Aquaculture, also called fish farming, fish culture, or mariculture,  an approximate equivalent in fishing to agricultureâ€”that is, the rearing of fish, shellfish, and some aquatic plants to supplement the natural supply. Fish are reared under controlled conditions all over the world.
Fish may be confined in earth ponds, concrete pools, barricaded coastal waters, or cages suspended in open water. In these enclosures, the fish can be supplied with adequate food and protected from many natural predators.
