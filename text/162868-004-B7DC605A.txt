Liturgical music, also called church music,  music written for performance in a religious rite of worship; the term is most commonly associated with the Christian tradition. Developing from the musical practices of the Jewish synagogues, which allowed the cantor an improvised charismatic song, early Christian services contained a simple refrain, or responsorial, sung by the congregation. This evolved into the various Western chants, the last of which, the Gregorian, reached its apogee in the Carolingian Renaissance. From the 10th century there also emerged a vast number of hymns.
Polyphony was at first restricted to major feasts. Solo ensembles of virtuoso singers were accompanied by the organ or, possibly, a group of instruments. By about 1200 the early polyphonic style culminated in the spectacular organa of the Notre-Dame school composers Léonin and Pérotin.
