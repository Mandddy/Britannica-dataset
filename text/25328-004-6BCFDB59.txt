George Wallace Melville,  (born July 31, 1841, New York City—died  March 17, 1912, Philadelphia) U.S. explorer and naval engineer who led the sole surviving party from George Washington De Long’s tragic North Polar expedition.
Melville entered the U.S. Navy in 1861 and in 1879 joined De Long’s crew on the “Jeanette.” When the vessel became lodged in the ice off northeastern Siberia, Melville’s engineering skill helped keep it afloat for almost two years until it was finally crushed. After a long, arduous journey by boat and sledge, Melville and a group of men reached the Siberian shore and obtained help at the mouth of the Lena River. He then led an expedition that found the remains of De Long and his party the following spring. The incredible hardships the searchers endured on their 500-mile (800-kilometre) trek are modestly told in Melville’s In the Lena Delta (1884). He was again chief engineer aboard the “Thetis” on a mission that in June 1884 rescued the survivors from Adolphus Washington Greely’s Arctic expedition.
