Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis), also called Rudolphi’s rorqual or pollack whale,  species of baleen whale capable of short bursts of speed that make it the swiftest of the rorquals. Usually attaining a length of about 13–15 metres (43–49 feet), this cetacean is bluish gray or blackish above with paler underparts and a relatively large hook-shaped (falcate) dorsal fin. The throat and chest have about 50 short ventral grooves running along their length, and the dark baleen plates have pale, silky inner fringes. Like those of the right whale, the sei’s baleen bristles are extremely fine (about the diameter of a human hair) and are used for feeding on small crustaceans such as copepods and krill.
The sei inhabits oceans from the Arctic to the Antarctic, spending the summer months in cold and temperate waters and then migrating to winter breeding grounds in warmer regions. Calves are slightly less than five metres long at birth.
