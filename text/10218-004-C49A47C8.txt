Loach,  any of the small, generally elongated freshwater fishes of the family Cobitidae. More than 200 species are known; most are native to central and southern Asia, but three are found in Europe and one in northern Africa. A typical loach has very small scales and three to six pairs of whiskerlike barbels around its mouth. In some species, such as the spined loach (Cobitis taenia) of Eurasia, there is also a short, movable spine near each eye.
Loaches are hardy, usually nocturnal fishes that inhabit both still and flowing waters. They use their barbels to comb the bottom for worms, insect larvae, and other food. In low and stagnant ponds, they may swallow air at the surface, their intestines then absorbing the oxygen and thus aiding respiration.
