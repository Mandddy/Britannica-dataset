Mink, either of two species of the weasel family (Mustelidae) native to the Northern Hemisphere. The European mink (Mustela lutreola) and the American mink (Neovison vison) are both valued for their luxurious fur. The American mink is one of the pillars of the fur industry and is raised in captivity throughout the world. In the wild, mink are small, discreet, and most often nocturnal, and they live in close proximity to water.
Both mink species measure about 30–50 cm (12–20 inches) in length, not including a 13–23-cm tail, and weigh 2 kg (4.5 pounds) or less; females are smaller. Like weasels, mink have short legs, a long, thick neck, and a broad head with short, rounded ears. The coat is deep, rich brown and sometimes has white markings on the throat, chest, and underparts. The pelage consists of a dense, soft underfur overlaid with dark and glossy guard hairs.
