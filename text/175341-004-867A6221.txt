Yellow Submarine, British animated film, released in 1968, that was based on the songs of the Beatles. It was designed to appeal more to hippies of the era and adult fans of the Beatles than to children, the traditional target of animated productions.
Based on the Beatles’ hit song of the same title, Yellow Submarine takes place in the fantasy world of Pepperland, a psychedelic paradise that faces imminent doom at the hands of the villainous Blue Meanies. The desperate residents call upon the Beatles to save the day, and they do so to the tune of various songs, including “When I’m Sixty-Four,” “Nowhere Man,” and “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” The film’s absurdist humour and lyrical allusions keep it in line with the band’s previous cinematic productions.
