Colin Wilson, in full Colin Henry Wilson  (born June 26, 1931, Leicester, Leicestershire, England—died December 5, 2013, St. Austell, Cornwall, England) English novelist and writer on philosophy, sociology, music, literature, and the occult.
Wilson left school at age 16. He subsequently worked as a laboratory assistant, civil servant, labourer, dishwasher, and factory worker. For a short while, until discharged on medical grounds, he served in the Royal Air Force (1949–50). He lived in Paris and Strasbourg (1950–51) and was working in a coffee bar while he wrote his first book, The Outsider (1956). The book was a study of alienation as glimpsed through the lives and writings of some of the principal intellectual figures of the 20th century. It was at first acclaimed for its brilliance, and this initial critical response catapulted Wilson to fame at the age of 24, in the process making The Outsider a best-seller.
