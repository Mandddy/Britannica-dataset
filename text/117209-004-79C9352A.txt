Barb, also called Barbel,   (genus Barbus), any of numerous freshwater fishes belonging to a genus in the carp family, Cyprinidae. The barbs are native to Europe, Africa, and Asia. The members of this genus typically have one or more pairs of barbels (slender, fleshy protuberances) near the mouth and often have large, shining scales. The species vary widely in size; certain barbs are only about 2.5–5 cm (1–2 inches) long, while the mahseer of India may be 2 m (6.5 feet) long. Several species are listed as endangered in the Red Data Book.
The barbel (B. barbus) of central and western European rivers is a slender, rather elongate fish with a thick-lipped, crescent-shaped mouth and four barbels, which it uses to search out fish, mollusks, and other food along the river bottom. The barbel is greenish and usually attains a length and weight of about 75 cm (30 inches) and 3 kg (6.5 pounds). It is a good sport fish.
