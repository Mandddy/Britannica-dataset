Clara Morris, original name Clara Morrison  (born March 17, 1848, Toronto, Ont., Can.—died Nov. 20, 1925, New Canaan, Conn., U.S.) American actress and writer, known chiefly for her realistic portrayals of unfortunate women in melodrama.
Morris was the eldest child of a bigamous marriage. When she was three her father was exposed, and her mother fled with her to Cleveland, Ohio, where they adopted her grandmother’s name, Morrison. Clara received only scanty schooling. About 1860 she became a dancer in the resident ballet company of the Cleveland Academy of Music and shortened her name to Morris. After nine years of training with that company, she played a season as leading lady at Wood’s Theatre, Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1869.
