Chrysler Building, office building in New York City, designed by William Van Alen and often cited as the epitome of the Art Deco skyscraper. Its sunburst-patterned stainless steel spire remains one of the most striking features of the Manhattan skyline. Built between 1928 and 1930, the Chrysler Building was briefly the tallest in the world, at 1,046 feet (318.8 metres). It claimed this honour in November 1929—when the building was topped off with a 180-foot (55-metre) spire—and held the record until the Empire State Building opened in 1931. The decorative scheme of the facade and interior is largely geometric; at the request of Walter P. Chrysler, who commissioned the building, stainless steel automobile icons (e.g., radiator caps in the form of Mercury) were incorporated in the frieze on the setback at the base of the tower and in decorative work on other parts of the building. The building’s pierless corners and sleek design are typical of the modernism of the 1920s. A major restoration of the landmark structure was conducted in the early 1980s.
