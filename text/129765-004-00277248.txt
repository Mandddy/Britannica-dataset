Larry David, in full Lawrence Gene David  (born July 2, 1947, Brooklyn, New York) American comedian and actor who was best known as the cocreator of the television series Seinfeld (1989–98) and as the star of Curb Your Enthusiasm (2000– ).
David attended the University of Maryland and graduated (1970) with a degree in history. He then returned to Brooklyn and found work with a bra wholesaler, one of the many David biographical details—including quitting a job and then returning to work as if the resignation never happened, stealing an answering machine tape so that a girlfriend would not hear the message he had left, and starting a soon-to-be infamous self-denial contest with his friends—that would later turn up in the life of Seinfeld’s “lovable loser” George Costanza.
