Bushbuck, also called Harnessed Antelope,   (Tragelaphus scriptus), African antelope of the family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), found in sub-Saharan forests and brush. It is nocturnal, shy, and usually solitary. The bushbuck stands about 1 m (39 inches) at the shoulder and ranges in colour from reddish brown to almost black, depending on the subspecies. Its markings vary but include white patches on the neck and throat and vertical stripes or rows of spots on the sides. Horns, present in males, are spirally twisted and relatively straight. The bushback inhabits areas of dense vegetation near bodies of water and feeds mainly on the leaves of shrubs and small trees.
