Crazy Horse, Sioux name Ta-sunko-witko  (born 1842?, near present-day Rapid City, South Dakota, U.S.—died September 5, 1877, Fort Robinson, Nebraska) Sioux chief of the Oglala tribe who was an able tactician and determined warrior in the Sioux resistance to the white man’s invasion of the northern Great Plains.
As early as 1865 Crazy Horse was a leader in his people’s defiance of U.S. plans to construct a road to the goldfields in Montana. He participated in the massacre of Captain William J. Fetterman and his troop of 80 men (December 21, 1866) as well as in the Wagon Box fight (August 2, 1867), both near Fort Phil Kearny, in Wyoming Territory. Refusing to honour the reservation provisions of the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), Crazy Horse led his followers to unceded buffalo country, where they continued to hunt, fish, and wage war against enemy tribes as well as whites.
