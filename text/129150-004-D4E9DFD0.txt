Balance, instrument for comparing the weights of two bodies, usually for scientific purposes, to determine the difference in mass (or weight).
The invention of the equal-arm balance dates back at least to the time of the ancient Egyptians, possibly as early as 5000 bc. In the earliest types, the beam was supported at the centre and the pans were hung from the ends by cords. A later improvement in design was the use of a pin through the centre of the beam for the central bearing, introduced by the Romans about the time of Christ. The invention of knife-edges in the 18th century led to the development of the modern mechanical balance. By the end of the 19th century the balance had developed in Europe into one of the worldâ€™s most precise types of measuring devices. In the 20th century, electronic balances were developed, depending on electrical compensation rather than mechanical deflection.
