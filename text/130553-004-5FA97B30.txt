Paraná, estado (state) of southern Brazil, bounded to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the state of Santa Catarina, on the southwest by Argentina, on the west by Paraguay, on the northwest by the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, and on the north and northeast by the state of São Paulo. Paraná was named for the Paraná River (Rio Paraná), which forms its western and northwestern border. Its capital, Curitiba, is in the eastern part of the state.
After a century of gradual penetration by bands of Spanish explorers from São Paulo and by Jesuit missionaries, the territory of the present state was occupied, to a large extent, by the forces of a Portuguese emissary, Gabriel de Lara, in the 1640s. Gold was discovered at several locations in the 17th century and attracted settlers. Eventually recognized as belonging to Portugal’s sphere of influence, rather than Spain’s, the territory was attached at first to the captaincy of São Paulo and subsequently to the province of the same name. Paraná became a separate province of the Brazilian Empire in 1853 and later a state of the Brazilian Republic in 1891.
