Les Diaboliques, (
        French: “The Devilish Ones”)  U.S. title Diabolique,  French suspense film, released in 1955, that is considered a classic of the genre. It was based on the novel Celle qui n’était plus (1952; “She Who Was No More”) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac.
The film is set in a decrepit French school for boys that is run by an irredeemably cruel headmaster (played by Paul Meurisse). His abusive treatment of both his wife (Véra Clouzot) and his mistress (Simone Signoret), both teachers at the school, drives them to conspire in his murder, which they disguise as an accidental drowning. When his body goes missing, however, and a ragtag detective (Charles Vanel) is assigned to the case, the women begin to witness chilling evidence that their tormentor may not be dead at all.
