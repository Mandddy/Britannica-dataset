Ramon Llull, also called Raymond Lully   (born 1232/33, Ciutat de Majorca [now Palma]?, Majorca [now in Spain]—died 1315/16, Tunis or near Majorca) Catalan mystic and poet whose writings helped to develop the Romance Catalan language and widely influenced Neoplatonic mysticism throughout medieval and 17th-century Europe. He is best known in the history of ideas as the inventor of an “art of finding truth” (ars inveniendi veritatis) that was primarily intended to support the Roman Catholic faith in missionary work but was also designed to unify all branches of knowledge.
Reared at the royal court of Majorca, Llull developed characteristics of a troubadour in his chivalrous upbringing. He wrote a manual of chivalry, which appeared in a 15th-century English version edited by William Caxton, the first English printer. From the large Moorish population in Majorca he acquired a knowledge of Arabic, which he used in some of his writings. His milieu also aroused in him an interest in Islamic Sufi mysticism and the Eastern contemplative spirit.
