Box set,  in Western theatre, realistically detailed, three-walled, roofed setting that simulates a room with the fourth wall (the one closest to the audience) removed. Authentic details include doors with three-dimensional moldings, windows backed with outdoor scenery, stairways, and, at times, painted highlights and shadows.
The box set was introduced in 1832 in Madame Vestrisâ€™ London production of The Conquering Game by William Bayle Bernard. It gained wide usage by the end of the 19th century and is a common feature of the modern theatre.
