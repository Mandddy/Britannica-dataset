Morton National Park,  national park in eastern New South Wales, Australia, lying in the coastal range 100 miles (160 km) south of Sydney. It has an area of 404 square miles (1,046 square km). It was established in 1938 and named for Mark Morton, a member of the state legislative assembly who campaigned vigorously for the reserve. The park is drained by the Shoalhaven and Kangaroo rivers and by several creeks. A notable feature is Fitzroy Falls. The sandstone summits in the park are covered with bloodwood-scribbly gum forest, and the sides and floors of the gorges are clothed in rain forest and hardwood trees. Among the forms of wildlife are platypus and native fish. Trails and rough roads lead from highways skirting the park.
