Marilyn Horne, in full Marilyn Bernice Horne   (born Jan. 16, 1934, Bradford, Pa., U.S.) American mezzo-soprano noted for the seamless quality and exceptional range and flexibility of her voice, especially in coloratura roles by Gioacchino Rossini and George Frideric Handel. She was also instrumental in reviving interest in their lesser-known operas.
Horne studied voice at the University of Southern California with William Vennard and at the Music Academy of the West, Santa Barbara, California, with Lotte Lehmann. In 1954 she dubbed the voice of Dorothy Dandridge in the film Carmen Jones; the same year, she made her opera debut with the Los Angeles Guild Opera as Hata in Bedřich Smetana’s The Bartered Bride. She left school and in 1956 performed the role of Giulietta in Jacques Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann at the Gelsenkirchen Opera in West Germany. In three seasons at the Gelsenkirchen she performed such roles as Fulvia in Handel’s Ezio and Marie in Alban Berg’s Wozzeck.
