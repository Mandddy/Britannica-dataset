Weddell Sea, deep embayment of the Antarctic coastline that forms the southernmost tip of the Atlantic Ocean. Centring at about 73° S, 45° W, the Weddell Sea is bounded on the west by the Antarctic Peninsula of West Antarctica, on the east by Coats Land of East Antarctica, and on the extreme south by frontal barriers of the Filchner and Ronne ice shelves. It has an area of about 1,080,000 square miles (2,800,000 square km).
The Weddell Sea is usually heavily iced, the pack generally extending north to about 60° S in the western and central sectors in early summer, a factor that severely hindered early ship exploration. On Feb. 23, 1820, the British brig “Williams,” on one of the first attempts at penetration, was stopped by ice off the coast of northeastern Graham Land. In the same year pack ice stopped the Russian ship “Vostok” just south of the South Sandwich Islands. On Feb. 20, 1823, a British explorer and sealer, James Weddell, on the brig “Jane,” found an unusually open route southeastward from the South Orkney Islands and reached a farthest south position of 74°15′ S, 34°17′ W. The name bestowed by Weddell, George IV Sea, was abandoned when, in 1900, it was proposed that the sea be named after its discoverer.
