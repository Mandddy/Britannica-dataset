Hiram R. Revels, in full Hiram Rhodes Revels  (born September 1, 1822, Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S.—died January 16, 1901, Aberdeen, Mississippi) American clergyman and educator who became the first black citizen to be elected to the U.S. Senate (1870–71), during Reconstruction.
Born of free parents, young Revels traveled to Indiana and Illinois to receive the education that was denied him in the South. He was ordained a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1845 and eventually settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he served as a church pastor and principal of a school for blacks. Soon after the Civil War began (1861), he helped organize two volunteer regiments of blacks for service in the Union army. Two years later he joined the Federal forces to serve as a chaplain to a black regiment stationed in Mississippi.
