Iceboating, also called Ice Yachting,  a winter sport of sailing and racing on ice in modified boats. An iceboat is basically a sailboat that travels on thin blades, or runners, on the surface of the ice. An iceboat consists first of a single fore-and-aft spar, called the backbone, which may be wide enough to have a cockpit in its hull to carry the crew. This spar, or hull, is securely mounted on a broad, flexible crosspiece, or runner plank, which is at a right angle to it and which has a steel runner at each of its two ends. A third runner, the steering runner, is mounted at either the fore or aft end of the hull and is controlled by the helmsman using a tiller. A vertical mast carries either one or two sails, usually a mainsail and a jib. Smaller iceboats dispense with a cockpit in the hull and instead have a shallow, elliptical tray mounted on the backbone and upon which the one- or two-man crew sits. The modern iceboatâ€™s structural elements are made of high-strength steel.
Although there are hints of iceboating in the archaeological past as far back as 2000 bc in what is now the Scandinavian region, iceboating as a means of winter transport dates firmly only to the 17th and 18th centuries on the frozen Gulf of Riga and on the canals of the Netherlands. In 1790 the first iceboat appeared on the Hudson River in New York.
