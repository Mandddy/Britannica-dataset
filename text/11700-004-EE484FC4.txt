Louis Fréron, in full Louis-marie-stanislas Fréron   (born Aug. 17, 1754, Paris, France—died  July 15, 1802, Santo Domingo, Hispaniola [now in Dominican Republic]) journalist of the French Revolution and leader of the jeunesse dorée (“gilded youth”) who terrorized Jacobins (radical democrats) during the Thermidorian reaction that followed the collapse of the Jacobin regime of 1793–94.
His father, Élie-Catherine Fréron, was the editor of L’Année Littéraire (“The Literary Year”), which combated the ideas of Voltaire and other Philosophes. Louis took over the management of the journal upon his father’s death in 1776, and, soon after the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he founded the newspaper L’Orateur du Peuple (“The Spokesman of the People”), which violently attacked the new system of constitutional monarchy.
