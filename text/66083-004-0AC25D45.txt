Danny Kaye, original name David Daniel Kaminsky, also spelled Kaminski, or Kominski  (born January 18, 1913, New York, New York, U.S.—died March 3, 1987, Los Angeles, California) energetic, multitalented American actor and comedian who later became known for his involvement with humanitarian causes.
The son of Ukrainian immigrants, Kaye began his performing career in the 1930s as a comic entertainer in hotels in the Catskill Mountains and in nightclubs across the United States. During this period he originated the pantomimes, rapid-fire scat singing, and physical antics that were to become his trademarks. Kaye soon achieved success on the Broadway stage beginning with The Straw Hat Revue (1939) and Lady in the Dark (1940), in which he upstaged the legendary Gertrude Lawrence with his performance of “Tchaikovsky,” a patter song in which he rattled off the names of more than 50 Russian composers in rapid succession. Such tongue-twisting tunes—most of them written by Kaye’s wife, Sylvia Fine—became a regular feature of Kaye’s films and live performances throughout the next two decades. During the early 1940s Kaye performed for American servicemen and became enormously successful as a headline star in New York City nightclubs. It was in one of these clubs that Hollywood producer Samuel Goldwyn caught Kaye’s act and offered him a film contract. Since Kaye was a star before he made his first film, Goldwyn spared no expense on Kaye’s lavish musical comedies.
