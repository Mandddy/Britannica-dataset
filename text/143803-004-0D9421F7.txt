George Mallory, in full George Herbert Leigh Mallory  (born June 18, 1886, Mobberley, Cheshire, Englandâ€”died June 8, 1924, North Face of Mount Everest, Tibet [now in China]) British explorer and mountaineer who was a leading member of early expeditions to Mount Everest. His disappearance on that mountain in 1924 became one of the most celebrated mysteries of the 20th century.
Mallory came from a long line of clergymen. While he was a student at Winchester College, one of the teachers recruited Mallory for an outing to the Alps, and he developed a strong aptitude for climbing. After graduating from the University of Cambridge, he became a schoolmaster, but he continued to refine his climbing skills in the Alps and in Wales. Other climbers of the era noted his natural, catlike climbing ability and his ability to find and conquer new and difficult routes.
