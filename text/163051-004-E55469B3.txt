Agasias,  (flourished c. 125â€“c. 75 bce, Ephesus [now in Turkey]) sculptor of Ephesus, known for his Borghese Warrior, a statue of a warrior on foot in combat with a warrior on horseback.
Agasias is known to have been the son of one Dositheus, but otherwise the only record of him derives from the inscription on the pedestal of the statue. The approximate dating is derived from the style of the work, which, along with the Apollo Belvidere, was discovered in the ruins of the imperial palace at Anzio (ancient Antium), Italy.
