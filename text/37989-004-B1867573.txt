Francis Poulenc,  (born Jan. 7, 1899, Paris, France—died  Jan. 30, 1963, Paris) composer who made an important contribution to French music in the decades after World War I and whose songs are considered among the best composed during the 20th century.
Poulenc was largely self-taught. His first compositions—Rapsodie Nègre (1917), Trois Mouvements Perpétuels, for piano, and Sonata for Piano Duet (1918) and his settings of Guillaume Apollinaire’s poem Le Bestiaire and Jean Cocteau’s Cocardes (1919)—were witty pieces with streaks of impudent parody. Humour remained an important characteristic of his music, as in the Surrealistic comic opera Les Mamelles de Tirésias (1947; The Breasts of Tiresias), based on a farce by Apollinaire.
