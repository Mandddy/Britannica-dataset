Spitting spider,  any member of the family Scytodidae (order Araneida). Most species have six pearly-white eyes rather than the usual eight. Spitting spiders ensnare their prey by spitting a mucilaginous saliva. They are most common in shady spots in the tropics. Scytodes thoracica, common in the eastern United States, is yellow with black spots. The body is 3 1/2–5 1/2 millimetres (1/8–1/4 inch) long.
