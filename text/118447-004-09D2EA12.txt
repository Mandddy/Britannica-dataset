Kent State was established in 1910 as the Kent Normal School; it was elevated to university standing in 1935. In May 1970 campus protests against the war in Vietnam led to the deaths of four students who were fired on by the Ohio National Guard; the event led to disorders at many American universities. The university, in connection with the Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls, organizes summer festivals of arts, music, and theatre.
