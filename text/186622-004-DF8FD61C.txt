Ermine (Mustela erminea), also called stoat, short-tailed weasel, or Bonaparte weasel,  northern weasel species in the genus Mustela, family Mustelidae. The species is called ermine especially during its winter white colour phase. The animal’s pelt was used historically in royal robes in Europe, and the term ermine also refers to the animal’s white coat, sold in the fur trade.
Widely distributed across northern North America and Eurasia, ermines are most abundant in thickets, woodlands, and semi-timbered areas. These slender, agile, voracious mammals measure 13 to 29 cm (5 to 12 inches) in head and body length, have a tail length of 5 to 12 cm, and weigh less than 0.3 kg (0.7 pound). Females are smaller than males, and members of northern populations are smaller than their southern counterparts.
