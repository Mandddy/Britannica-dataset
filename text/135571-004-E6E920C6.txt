Hugh Swinton Legaré,  (born Jan. 2, 1797, Charleston, S.C., U.S.—died  June 20, 1843, Boston) U.S. lawyer, a conservative Southern intellectual who opposed the attempts of South Carolina’s radicals to nullify the Tariff of 1832.
Legaré studied for a year under Moses Waddel before going on to become the valedictorian of his class at South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina, Columbia). Following three years of studying law in the United States, Legaré went to Europe to advance his education. In 1820 he returned to South Carolina, where he served in the state legislature for most of the decade.
