House of Wax, American horror film, released in 1953, that established Vincent Price as a leading actor in the genre. It was one of the first films shot in 3-D.
Price portrayed Prof. Henry Jarrod, an ingenious sculptor of wax statues and part owner of a wax museum that is burned down by his business partner in an attempt to collect insurance money. Soon thereafter, the partner and his girlfriend go missing, and Jarrod, who was thought to have died in the fire, shows up alive but disfigured and wheelchair-bound. He approaches a wealthy financier with a plan for a new wax museum, a “Chamber of Horrors” that will exhibit eerily lifelike wax figures. It is soon noticed, however, that the waxworks bear a striking resemblance to persons mysteriously missing from the community, and this leads to the horrific discovery that the figures on display are actual corpses dipped in wax. After a struggle in the museum, the murderous Jarrod (who had only feigned his paralysis) falls to his death into a cauldron of hot wax.
