Gwynedd, county of northwestern Wales, extending from the Irish Sea in the west to the mountains of Snowdonia in the east. It encompasses most of the historic counties of Caernarvonshire and Merioneth. Caernarfon is the administrative centre of the county.
The county is named for the medieval Welsh princedom of Gwynedd, which, under the Llewellyns, proudly held out against the territorial ambitions of Edward I of England in the late 13th century. From their great castles at Caernarfon and Conwy, the Normans did not penetrate inland. Gwynedd thus has remained a stronghold of Welsh culture, with a far higher proportion of Welsh-speaking people (two-thirds) than any other county in the principality. Apart from the concentrations at the coastal resorts, the present dispersed settlement pattern is a complex product of Welsh family homestead inheritance practices.
