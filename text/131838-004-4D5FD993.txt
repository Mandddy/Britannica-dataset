Helen Farnsworth Mears,  (born December 21, 1872, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, U.S.—died February 17, 1916, New York, New York)  American sculptor best remembered for her large-scale public commissions in bronze and bas-relief.
Mears attended Oshkosh State Normal School (now a branch of the University of Wisconsin). In 1892 she was commissioned to sculpt a design of a woman and winged eagle, titled Genius of Wisconsin, for the Wisconsin Building at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. While executing the work at The Art Institute of Chicago, she received some encouragement from the sculptor Lorado Taft. The success of the piece, which was later installed in the Wisconsin State Capitol, enabled Mears to travel to New York City and enroll in the Art Students League. Shortly afterward she became an assistant to and student of the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. From 1897 to 1899 she studied in France and Italy.
