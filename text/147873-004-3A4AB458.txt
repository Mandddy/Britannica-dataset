Peking duck, one of the most celebrated dishes of Beijing, or Mandarin Chinese, cuisine, with a history of more than 400 years. In its classic form, the dish calls for a specific breed of duck, the Imperial Peking, that is force-fed and housed in a small cage so that inactivity will ensure tender meat. The neck and head are left intact as the bird is killed (at about six weeks old) and dressed, and, after the entrails are removed, the lower opening is sewed shut. Air is forced between the skin and flesh to puff out the skin so that the fat will be rendered out during roasting and the skin, the choicest part of the dish, will be very crisp. The inflated bird is painted with a sweet solution, hung up to dry, then roasted suspended, traditionally, in a cylindrical clay oven.
Peking duck is usually served in three courses. The skin is accompanied by hoisin sauce (a commercially prepared, reddish brown, sweet, and spicy sauce), scallions cut into brushes, and thin wheat-flour pancakes or steamed wheat-flour “lotus buns,” all of which are eaten together as a sandwich. The meat of the duck is cut up and served with vegetables as a second course, and a soup of the duck’s bones with celery cabbage follows. Because of the complicated preparation, Peking duck is primarily restaurant fare.
