Proprietary colony, in British American colonial history, a type of settlement dominating the period 1660â€“90, in which favourites of the British crown were awarded huge tracts of land in the New World to supervise and develop. Before that time, most of the colonies had been financed and settled under the jurisdiction of joint-stock companies operating under charters granted by the crown. After the Restoration (1660), Charles II used proprietaries as a device to meet pent-up demands for territorial expansion as well as to repay political and economic debts incurred in the struggle for the throne. Vast tracts of land in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina and South Carolina were distributed in this way.
The first permanent European settlement in what became New Jersey was established by the Dutch at Bergen (now Jersey City) in 1660. The colony was brought under English rule in 1664 (although for the next nine years the Dutch disputed that claim), when Charles II granted the territory that later became New York and New Jersey to his brother James (later King James II), who conveyed New Jersey to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. In 1674 Berkeley sold western New Jersey to the Quakers John Fenwick and Edward Byllynge.
