Lionel Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild, in full Lionel Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild of Tring  (born February 8, 1868, London, England—died August 27, 1937, Tring, Buckinghamshire) British zoologist who became a great collector and founded the Rothschild Natural History Museum in London. The eldest son of Nathan Mayer Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild, he received his titles on the death of his father in 1915.
Rothschild studied at the University of Bonn and then at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his interests and ambitions in zoology developed under the influence of the distinguished zoologist Alfred Newton. Rothschild’s boyhood collections of insects increased to include birds and mammals, which he housed in buildings on his father’s estate at Tring. After joining the bank of N.M. Rothschild and Sons, he had less time to devote to his museum and, consequently, hired others to continue its development; the museum was opened to the public in 1892.
