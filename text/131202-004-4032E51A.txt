Geodesy,  scientific discipline concerned with the precise figure of the Earth and its determination and significance. Until the advent of satellites, all geodesic work was based on land surveys made by triangulation methods employing a geodesic coordinate system (one used to study the geometry of curved surfaces). It is now possible to use satellites in conjunction with the land-based system to refine knowledge of the Earthâ€™s shape and dimensions; this endeavour is sometimes termed satellite geodesy.
