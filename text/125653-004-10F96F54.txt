Lugworm,  (genus Arenicola), any of several marine worms (class Polychaeta, phylum Annelida) that burrow deep into the sandy sea bottom or intertidal areas and are often quite large. Fishermen use them as bait. Adult lugworms of the coast of Europe (e.g., A. marina) attain lengths of about 23 cm (9 inches). The lugworm of the coasts of North America (A. cristata) ranges in length from 7.5 to 30 cm.
The body is segmented, or ringed. The head end is dark red; behind it the body is fatter and lighter in colour. Toward the tail the body becomes thinner and yellowish red. The middle of the body has bristles and about 12 pairs of feathery gills.
