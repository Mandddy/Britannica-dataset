Béla Kun,  (born February 20, 1886, Szilágycseh, Transylvania, Austria-Hungary [now in Romania]—died November 30, 1939?, U.S.S.R.) communist leader and head of the Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919.
The son of a Jewish village clerk, Kun became active in Social Democratic politics early in life, working at first in Transylvania and later in Budapest. He was mobilized in the Austro-Hungarian army at the outbreak of World War I, became a prisoner of war in Russia in 1916, and joined the Bolsheviks. Attracting the attention of V.I. Lenin, Kun received training in revolutionary tactics and returned to Hungary after the collapse of the Central Powers in November 1918. He started a communist newspaper and founded the Hungarian Communist Party on December 20, 1918. Though imprisoned in February 1919 by the government of Mihály Károlyi, Kun was allowed to continue directing Hungary’s Communist Party from his cell. His extensive propaganda combined social agitation with promises that, if given power, he would secure Soviet aid against the Romanian forces then occupying parts of Hungary.
