Pindar, Greek Pindaros, Latin Pindarus  (born probably 518 bc, Cynoscephalae, Boeotia, Greece—died  after 446, probably c. 438, Argos) the greatest lyric poet of ancient Greece and the master of epinicia, choral odes celebrating victories achieved in the Pythian, Olympic, Isthmian, and Nemean games.
Pindar was of noble birth, possibly belonging to a Spartan family, the Aegeids, though the evidence for this is inconclusive. His parents, Daiphantus and Cleodice, survive only as names; his uncle Scopelinus, a skilled aulos player, doubtless helped with Pindar’s early musical training. The family possessed a town house in Thebes (to be spared by express command of Alexander the Great in the general destruction of that city by the Macedonians in 335 bc). Such a background would have given Pindar a ready entrée into aristocratic circles in other Greek cities.
