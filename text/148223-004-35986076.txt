Golden algae, also called golden-brown algae,  members of the class Chrysophyceae (about 1,200 species) found in both marine and fresh waters. Diverse in form, although most are primitive single-celled flagellates, they are characterized by the pigment fucoxanthin and oil droplets as the food-reserve. Sexual reproduction is rare; asexual reproduction is by the formation of motile and nonmotile spores and by cell division.
