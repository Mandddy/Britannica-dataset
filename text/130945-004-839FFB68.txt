Steny H. Hoyer, in full Steny Hamilton Hoyer  (born June 14, 1939, New York City, N.Y., U.S.) American Democratic politician, a representative from Maryland in the United States House of Representatives (1981– ), where he served as majority leader (2007–11) and minority whip (2011– ). In 2007 he became the longest-serving member of the House from Maryland.
Hoyer first became interested in politics when he heard John F. Kennedy give a campaign speech at the University of Maryland, College Park (B.A., 1963). He later attended law school at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. (J.D., 1966), and, campaigning on a platform of fair housing, ran a successful bid for the Maryland state senate in 1966. In 1975, at age 35, he became the youngest person ever to hold the office of president of the state senate. Hoyer joined the U.S. House of Representatives in 1981 through a special election after Rep. Gladys Noon Spellman’s seat was left vacant by illness; he subsequently won reelection.
