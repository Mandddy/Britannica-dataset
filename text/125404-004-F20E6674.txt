Charles Bronson, original name Charles Buchinsky   (born November 3, 1921, Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died August 30, 2003, Los Angeles, California) American motion-picture and television actor who was best known for his portrayal of tough guys.
Bronson was one of 15 children of a Lithuanian coal miner, became a miner himself at age 16, and during World War II claimed to have served in the air force as a tail gunner (later reports suggest that he was stationed in Arizona, working as a delivery man). After the war he held a series of odd jobs before being hired by a Philadelphia theatre company to paint scenery. That eventually led to small acting parts, and in 1949 he moved to California. Bronson made his big-screen debut in You’re in the Navy Now (1951), and the leathery-faced, muscular actor was soon playing tough-guy leads in B-films such as Machine Gun Kelly (1958) and appearing in several television series. More memorable roles followed in The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), The Dirty Dozen (1967).
