Living-rock cactus, any of the six species composing the genus Ariocarpus, family Cactaceae, and especially A. fissuratus. The members of the genus almost entirely lack spines but are covered by woolly hairs. They are native to Texas and Mexico and live on limestone-rich soil.
All the species are low-growing and have a rosette of tubercles that are flattened in A. fissuratus and A. kotschoubeyanus. In the other four species, the pointed tubercles protrude. Water is stored against the dry winter in the thickened taproot and in mucilage canals and reservoirs.
