After the Thin Man, American detective film, released in 1936, that was the second and perhaps most successful sequel in the Thin Man series. The films follow the adventures of retired detective Nick Charles and his wife, Nora.
Nick (played by William Powell) and Nora (Myrna Loy) return to their San Francisco home for a New Year’s Eve party after having just solved the “thin man” murder detailed in the first film (1934) in the series. They immediately get embroiled in solving another case, this time involving Nora’s cousin, Selma Landis (Elissa Landi), whose husband, Robert (Alan Marshal), has vanished. After agreeing to help, Nick promptly finds Robert at a nightclub with his mistress, the club’s star performer. Unbeknownst to Robert—who is trying to extort money from his wife’s former fiancé, David (James Stewart)—his mistress is in cahoots with one of the club’s owners, and the pair plans to abscond with the cash. Robert is later murdered, and Selma is discovered holding the gun. Murders continue until Nick finally reveals the culprit, the least likely suspect of them all: David. The film ends with Nora knitting a baby bootee. “And you call yourself a detective,” she says chidingly to Nick, who had failed to realize that she was pregnant.
