Brown four-eyed opossum (Metachirus nudicaudatus), also called rat-tailed opossum,  the only large American marsupial (family Didelphidae, subfamily Didelphinae) that lacks a pouch. It gets its name from its brownish to yellowish fur colour and the creamy white spot above each eye. This opossum inhabits lowland tropical forests from southern Mexico to northeastern Argentina. Adults average 57 cm (22 inches) in total length and weigh as much as 480 grams (1 pound). The ears are dark brown and naked. The tail is longer than the head and body, sparsely haired except at the base, and brownish above, paler below, and white on the terminal third.
Brown four-eyed opossums eat eggs, insects, small animals, and a variety of fruits. These opossums are primarily terrestrial, although they build nests in trees, as well as under logs, rocks, and thick leaf litter. Females reproduce throughout the year, and litters contain up to nine young.
