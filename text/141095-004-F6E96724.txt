Dalriada, Irish Dál Riada or Riata,  Gaelic kingdom that, at least from the 5th century ad, extended on both sides of the North Channel and composed the northern part of the present County Antrim, Northern Ireland, and part of the Inner Hebrides and Argyll, in Scotland. In earlier times, Argyll had received extensive immigration from the Irish (known as Scoti until the 12th century) of northern Ireland and had become an Irish (i.e., “Scottish”) area. In c. 500, the ruling family of Irish Dalriada crossed into Scottish Dalriada and made Dunadd and Dunolly its chief strongholds. Irish Dalriada gradually declined; and after the Viking invasions early in the 9th century, it lost all political identity. Heavy onslaughts from the Picts checked the Dalriada of the Scottish mainland. In the mid-9th century its king Kenneth I MacAlpin brought the Picts and Scoti permanently together, and thereafter the whole country was known as Scotland.
