Nam June Paik,  (born July 20, 1932, Seoul, Korea [now South Korea]—died Jan. 29, 2006, Miami Beach, Fla., U.S.) Korean-born composer, performer, and artist who was from the early 1960s one of postmodern art’s most provocative and innovative figures.
Paik studied art and music history at the University of Tokyo before moving to West Germany, where he continued his studies (1956–58) at the University of Munich. In the late 1950s, while working in West German Radio’s electronic music studio in Cologne, Paik met American avant-garde composer John Cage, whose inventive compositions and unorthodox ideas had a major influence on the budding artist. He also became involved during this time with the group Fluxus.
