Aḥmad Shawqī, Shawqī also spelled Shauqi   (born 1868, Cairo, Egypt—died  Oct. 13, 1932, Cairo) the amīr al-shuʿarāʾ (“prince of poets”) of modern Arabic poetry and a pioneer of Arabic poetical drama.
Shawqī, a member of a family attached to the khedivial court, was sent by the khedive to France to study at Montpellier and Paris universities. On his return the path of quick promotion lay open to him, and by 1914 he was the leading literary figure in Egypt. He spent 1914–19 in exile in Spain but on his return continued to dominate the Egyptian literary scene. In 1927 he was proclaimed amīr al-shuʿarāʾ.
