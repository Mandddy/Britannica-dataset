Blaise Cendrars, pseudonym of Frédéric Sauser   (born Sept. 1, 1887, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switz.—died  Jan. 21, 1961, Paris, Fr.) French-speaking poet and essayist who created a powerful new poetic style to express a life of action and danger. His poems Pâques à New York (1912; “Easter in New York”) and La Prose du Transsibérien et de la petite Jehanne de France (1913; “The Prose of the Trans-Siberian and of Little Jehanne of France”) are combination travelogues and laments.
Poetry, to Cendrars, was action sealed into words by bold new devices: simultaneous impressions in a jumble of images, feelings, associations, surprise effects, conveyed in a halting, syncopated rhythm. His novel Bourlinguer (1948; “Knocking About”) glorifies the dangerous life. His abundant, mainly autobiographical writings were a strong influence on his contemporaries.
