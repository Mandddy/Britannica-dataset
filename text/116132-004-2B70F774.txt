Perthshire, also called Perth,  historic county of central Scotland, including a section of the Grampian Mountains in the southern Highlands and a portion of the northern Scottish Lowlands, centred on the city of Perth. Most of Perthshire lies within the council area of Perth and Kinross. The southwestern portion of the county is part of the council area of Stirling, and a small section in the south around Yetts oâ€™ Muckhart lies within the council area of Clackmannanshire.
In ad 83 the Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola explored the lands beyond the Firth of Forth and in the following year penetrated to the Grampians. The growing lawlessness of the southern Picts and their frequent raids in the more settled country in the south later compelled the attention of the Roman emperor Severus. Though he led a strong army to the shores of the Moray Firth, he was unable to subdue the tribesmen. There were several Roman forts in the county, such as those at Bochastle, Dalginross, Bertha, and Fendoch, as well as a legionary fortress at Inchtuthil; along the Earn there were many signal stations, and a series of towers and forts are located on and around the Gask Ridge. However, the Roman occupation of the area was unsuccessful and brief.
