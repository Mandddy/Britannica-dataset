Sordariomycetes, class of several thousand species of sac fungi in the phylum Ascomycota (kingdom Fungi) characterized by a flask-shaped fruiting body (perithecium) that bears saclike structures (asci) and usually has a pore (ostiole) through which ascospores are discharged. Genera that parasitize higher plants include Ophiostoma (the cause of Dutch elm disease), Gnomonia (leaf spots), Diaporthe (stem and leaf blights), Cryphonectria (chestnut blight), Claviceps (ergot of rye), and the powdery mildew fungi. Fungal genetics have been extensively studied in Neurospora and Glomerella.
