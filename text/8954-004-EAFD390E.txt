Maarten Tromp,  (born April 23, 1598, Breille, Holland—died Aug. 9, 1653, at sea off Terheijde, near Scheveningen) Dutch admiral, the highest ranking sea commander (from 1636) under the stadholder during the Dutch wars with Spain and England during the first half of the 17th century. His victory over the Spanish in the Battle of the Downs (1639) signalled the passing of Spain’s power at sea.
At the age of nine, he sailed with his father, Harpert Maartenszoon, the captain of a small man-of-war. When his father changed to the merchant fleet, Maarten accompanied him, but in 1609 the ship was taken by an English pirate, his father was killed, and Maarten was forced to serve the pirate captain for two years.
