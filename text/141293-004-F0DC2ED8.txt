Chordate, any member of the phylum Chordata, which includes the vertebrates, the most highly evolved animals, as well as two other subphylaâ€”the tunicates and cephalochordates. Some classifications also include the phylum Hemichordata with the chordates.
As the name implies, at some time in the life cycle a chordate possesses a stiff, dorsal supporting rod (the notochord). Also characteristic of the chordates are a tail that extends behind and above the anus, a hollow nerve cord above (or dorsal to) the gut, gill slits opening from the pharynx to the exterior, and an endostyle (a mucus-secreting structure) or its derivative between the gill slits. (A characteristic feature may be present only in the developing embryo and may disappear as the embryo matures into the adult form.) A somewhat similar body plan can be found in the closely related phylum Hemichordata.
