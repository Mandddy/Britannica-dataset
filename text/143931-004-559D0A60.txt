The Hôtel Biron, covering 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of land in Paris, was completed in 1730 by Jean Aubert. Rodin moved into the Hôtel Biron in 1908 and continued his work there until his death.

Three years later the Hôtel Biron officially opened as the primary museum displaying Rodin’s artistic accomplishments.
