Eliza Maria Mosher,  (born Oct. 2, 1846, Cayuga county, N.Y., U.S.—died Oct. 16, 1928, New York, N.Y.) American physician and educator whose wide-ranging medical career included an educational focus on physical fitness and health maintenance.
In 1869, over the objections of friends and family, Mosher entered the New England Hospital for Women and Children as an intern apprentice. After a year she was forced to suspend her education to nurse her mother, and during that time she also assisted a woman doctor in Boston. In 1871 she entered the University of Michigan, where she completed the medical course and received her M.D. in 1875. From 1875 to 1877 she was in private practice with a classmate in Poughkeepsie, New York, after which she was appointed resident physician at the Massachusetts Reformatory Prison for Women, newly opened at the instigation of Ellen C. Johnson. After establishing hospital facilities in the prison, Mosher was responsible for virtually all medical, surgical, and dental care. In 1880 she was made superintendent of the prison, but an accidental injury three years later forced her to resign. She then returned to private practice in Brooklyn, New York, in partnership with Lucy M. Hall, a Michigan classmate and colleague at the reformatory. Mosher and Hall also alternated semesters as resident physician and associate professor of physiology and hygiene at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie (1883–87).
