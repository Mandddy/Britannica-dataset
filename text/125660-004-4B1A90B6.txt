Sea mouse,  (Aphrodita), any of a genus of marine worms of the class Polychaeta (phylum Annelida), named for their mouselike appearance and behaviour.
Sea mice are usually 7.5–15 centimetres (3–6 inches) long; however, some attain a length of 30 centimetres (12 inches). The slightly arched back is covered with a dense mat of hairlike setae about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long. The sea mouse burrows and creeps in a manner suggestive of a true mouse as it searches for dead and decaying bodies of animals—its main diet.
