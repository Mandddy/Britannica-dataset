Giovanni Verga,  (born Sept. 2, 1840, Catania, Sicily—died  Jan. 27, 1922, Catania) novelist, short-story writer, and playwright, most important of the Italian verismo (Realist) school of novelists (see verismo). His reputation was slow to develop, but modern critics have assessed him as one of the greatest of all Italian novelists. His influence was particularly marked on the post-World War II generation of Italian authors; a landmark film of the Neorealist cinema movement, Luchino Visconti’s Terra trema (1948; The Earth Trembles), was based on Verga’s novel I malavoglia.
Born to a family of Sicilian landowners, Verga went to Florence in 1869 and later lived in Milan, where the ideas of other writers much influenced his work. In 1893 he returned to Catania.
