The maned wolf has a foxlike head, long reddish brown fur, very long blackish legs, and an erectile mane. Its length ranges from 125 to 130 cm (50 to 52 inches), excluding the 30â€“40-centimetre tail. Its shoulder height is about 75 cm, and its weight is approximately 23 kg (50 pounds). A solitary animal, the maned wolf is primarily nocturnal and feeds on small animals, insects, and plant material. It attacks sheep but generally avoids human contact.
