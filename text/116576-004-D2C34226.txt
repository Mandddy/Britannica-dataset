Snowmobile, a one- or two-passenger motorized vehicle with one or two skis in front and an engine-driven single or double continuous track to propel it. Snowmobiles almost all follow the basic design of skis, fuel tank, engine, and seating for driver. They are steered by handlebars that control the skis and by shifting the position of the driver. Acceleration and braking are controlled by hand-squeeze throttle and brake controls on the handlebars.
In the 1920s a prototype snowmobile was a sled steered by skis and powered by an airplane propeller. Early vehicles, because of the weight of the engines available at that time, had to be large to spread the weight over the snow. In the early 1950s the advent of smaller, lighter weight engines enabled Joseph-Armand Bombardier, a Canadian, to develop a small snowmobile. In 1959 a commercially successful one- or two-passenger snowmobile was manufactured and marketed. The snowmobile soon became a popular recreational vehicle in North America.
