Foil, a sword with a light, flexible blade of rectangular cross section tapering to a blunt point. It was designed as a practice weapon for the smallsword fashionable in the 17th century and is now used primarily in the sport of fencing.
The modern fencing foil has a maximum overall length of 110 cm (3 feet 7 inches) and a maximum weight of 500 grams (about 17.5 ounces), although it is usually lighter for greater speed of movement. The blade is of finely tempered steel up to 90 cm (2 feet 11 1/2 inches) long, with a usually circular handguard up to 12 cm in diameter.
