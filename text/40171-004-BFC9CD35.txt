William Zorach, original name Zorach Garfinkel, Garfinkel also spelled Garfinkle or Gorfinkel, surname taken on immigration Finklestein  (born Feb. 28, 1889, Eurburg [now Jurbarkas], Lith.—died  Nov. 15, 1966, Bath, Maine, U.S.) traditionalist sculptor of simple, figurative subjects who was a leading figure in the early 20th-century revival of direct carving, whereby the sculptor seeks an image directly from the material to be carved, relying on neither the inspiration of models nor the aid of mechanical devices. Zorach’s mature work is monumental in form and makes skillful use of the natural colour, veining, and textures of the materials used—usually stone and wood. Often he left the marks of the sculptor’s tools to enrich the surface.
Zorach immigrated to the United States with his family when he was young and was reared in Cleveland. One of his grade-school teachers gave him the “more American” name Billy, and he dropped the name Finklestein later, at his wife’s suggestion. He studied painting at the Cleveland Institute of Art and in Paris (1910–11), where he painted with vivid colours and freely rendered forms in the manner of Henri Matisse and other painters of the Fauve movement (see Fauvism). While in Paris he met and later married Marguerite Thompson, also an artist. He took up sculpture in 1917 and gave up painting, except for watercolour, in 1922. From 1929 to 1960 Zorach taught sculpture at the Art Students League in New York City, where he inspired many students to take up wood carving. Among his major public commissions are Spirit of the Dance (1932), the Mayo Clinic relief Man and Work (1953), and Spirit of the Sea (1962).
