Edward de Vere, 17th earl of Oxford,  (born April 12, 1550, Castle Hedingham, Essex, England—died June 24, 1604, Newington, Middlesex) English lyric poet and theatre patron, who became, in the 20th century, the strongest candidate proposed (next to William Shakespeare himself) for the authorship of Shakespeare’s plays. Evidence exists that Oxford was known during his lifetime to have written some plays, though there are no known examples extant.
Succeeding to the earldom as a minor in 1562, Oxford lived for eight years as a royal ward under the care of William Cecil (later Lord Burghley) and in December 1571 married Burghley’s daughter, Anne Cecil. Along the way he studied with Arthur Golding (who translated Ovid’s Metamorphoses into English in the 1560s) and at Queens’ College and St. John’s College, Cambridge. By the early 1580s his financial position had become very straitened, perhaps chiefly through his lack of financial sense. His younger children were provided for by Burghley, with whom he remained friendly even after Anne’s death (June 1588) and his own remarriage in 1591 or 1592. In 1586 Queen Elizabeth granted him an annuity of £1,000.
