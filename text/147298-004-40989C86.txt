Total internal reflection, in physics, complete reflection of a ray of light within a medium such as water or glass from the surrounding surfaces back into the medium. The phenomenon occurs if the angle of incidence is greater than a certain limiting angle, called the critical angle. In general, total internal reflection takes place at the boundary between two transparent media when a ray of light in a medium of higher index of refraction approaches the other medium at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle. For a water-air surface the critical angle is 48.5Â°. Because indices of refraction depend on wavelength, the critical angle (and hence the angle of total internal reflection) will vary slightly with wavelength and, therefore, with colour. At all angles less than the critical angle, both refraction and reflection occur in varying proportions.
Glass prisms can be shaped to produce total internal reflection and as such are employed in binoculars, periscopes, telescopes, and other optical instruments. Light rays may be conducted over long, twisting paths by multiple total internal reflection in glass or plastic rods or fibres. See also fibre optics.
