Sadakichi Hartmann, in full Carl Sadakichi Hartmann  (born November 8, 1867, Nagasaki, Japan—died November 21, 1944, St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S.) American art critic, novelist, poet, and man of letters.
The son of a German father and Japanese mother, Hartmann went to the United States as a boy (he became a naturalized citizen in 1894). While living in Philadelphia from 1882 to 1885, he befriended the elderly Walt Whitman, visiting the author at his home in Camden, New Jersey. As a young man Hartmann became acquainted with many of the major artistic and literary figures in Europe and the United States. He was quick to appreciate the importance of French Symbolism and became friends with Stéphane Mallarmé, one of the leaders of the movement. He was also influenced by the Belgian Symbolist writer Maurice Maeterlinck.
