Hal Holbrook, in full Harold Rowe Holbrook, Jr.  (born February 17, 1925, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.) American actor best known for his exacting portrayal of author Mark Twain in his one-man show, Mark Twain Tonight!, for more than five decades.
Holbrookâ€™s parents abandoned him and his siblings when he was two years old, and they were raised thereafter by their grandparents. In 1942 Holbrook entered Denison University, Ohio, where he studied theatre arts. At the end of his first year, however, he joined the U.S. Army to serve in World War II. He worked as a military engineer for the next three years, during which time he participated in an amateur theatre group in Newfoundland. Following his service Holbrook returned to Denison, graduating with a B.A. in theatre arts in 1948.
