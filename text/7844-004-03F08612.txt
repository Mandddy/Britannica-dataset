Crop duster,  usually, an aircraft used for dusting or spraying large acreages with pesticides, though other types of dusters are also employed. Aerial spraying and dusting permit prompt coverage of large areas at the moment when application of pesticide is most effective and avoid the need for wheeled vehicles that might damage crops. The technique was greatly improved in the 1960s with the development of ultra-low-volume applicators, in which concentrated pesticides are distributed in amounts as small as 1 ounce per acre (70 grams per hectare). The method was used with outstanding success against desert locusts in East Africa, India, and elsewhere. See also spraying and dusting.
