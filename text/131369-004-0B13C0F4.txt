Jean-Antoine de Baïf,  (born 1532, Venice [Italy]—died  October 1589, Paris, France) most learned of the seven French poets who constituted the group known as La Pléiade.
Baïf received a classical education and in 1547 went with Pierre de Ronsard to study under Jean Dorat at the Collège de Coqueret, Paris, where they planned, with Joachim du Bellay, to transform French poetry by imitating the ancients and the Italians. To this program Baïf contributed two collections of Petrarchan sonnets and Epicurean lyrics, Les Amours de Méline (1552) and L’Amour de Francine (1555). In 1567 Le Brave, ou Taillebras, Baïf’s lively adaptation of Plautus’ Miles gloriosus, was played at court and published.
