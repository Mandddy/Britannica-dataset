Baby Dodds, byname of Warren Dodds  (born December 24, 1898, New Orleans, La., U.S.—died February 14, 1959, Chicago, Ill.) African-American musican, a leading early jazz percussionist and one of the first major jazz drummers on record.
At an early age Dodds played drums in New Orleans parade and jazz bands, and in 1918–21 he played in Fate Marable’s riverboat bands. In 1922 he went to San Francisco to join King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band. Dodds recorded with Oliver in Chicago the following year, and before the end of the decade, he appeared on classic recordings with other ex-New Orleans small-group leaders such as Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and Baby’s brother Johnny Dodds. He also played in Johnny’s bands during the 1920s and ’30s; during the 1940s traditional jazz revival, he was active in New York City as well as in Chicago, including a period with Bunk Johnson’s popular band (1944–45). Poor health led Dodds to perform only irregularly after 1949.
