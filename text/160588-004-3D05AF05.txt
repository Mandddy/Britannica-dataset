José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi,  (born November 15, 1776, Mexico City, Mexico—died June 21, 1827, Mexico City) Mexican editor, pamphleteer, and novelist, a leading literary figure in Mexico’s national liberation movement.
Largely self-taught, Fernández wrote as “the Mexican thinker,” taking this pseudonym from the title of his radical journal, El pensador mexicano (1812). For flouting both the monarchy and the papacy he was imprisoned and excommunicated. His El periquillo sarniento (1816; The Itching Parrot), the first picaresque novel of Spanish America, is a colourful tale that depicts the state of Mexican society in the early 19th century and reflects the ideas of the French Enlightenment and of Jean-Jacques Rousseau on education. He also wrote La Quijotita y su prima (1819; “Miss Quixote and Her Cousin”) and Las noches tristes y días alegres (1823; “Sad Nights and Happy Days”).
