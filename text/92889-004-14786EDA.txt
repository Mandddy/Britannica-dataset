Goldfinch, any of several species of the genus Carduelis (some formerly in Spinus) of the songbird family Fringillidae; they have short, notched tails and much yellow in the plumage. All have rather delicate sharp-pointed bills for finches. Flocks of goldfinches feed on weeds in fields and gardens. They have high, lisping calls, often given in flight. The 14-cm (5.5-inch) European goldfinch (C. carduelis) of western Eurasia has been introduced into Australia, New Zealand, and Bermuda and the United States (where it has not become established). It is brownish and black, with a red–white–black head pattern and gold in the wings (sexes alike). The 13-cm (5-inch) American goldfinch (C. tristis), also called wild canary, is found across North America; the male is bright yellow, with black cap, wings, and tail. The 10-cm (4-inch) dark-backed goldfinch (C. psaltria) ranges from the western U.S. (where it is called lesser goldfinch) to Peru.
