Chinese crested, breed of toy dog of ancient ancestry; it is one of the hairless breeds, its coat being confined to its head (crest), tail (plume), and lower legs (socks), although most litters also contain “powderpuff” pups with a full coat. The origin of the breed is uncertain; it may have originated in Africa, and it is thought to have been spread throughout the world by Chinese merchant ships. The gene that results in hairlessness is dominant but lethal, resulting in the death of fetal pups with two dominant genes before birth. Pups with two recessive genes for normal coats are powderpuffs.
The Chinese crested is a slender, fine-boned dog about 11 to 13 inches (28 to 33 cm) tall, weighing 5 to 10 pounds (2 to 4.5 kg). The coat that is present may be any colour, and the skin of hairless areas likewise may be variously coloured, and may be spotted and blotched or solid. Powderpuff dogs have a short, soft undercoat with longer, silky guard hairs. Hairless dogs must be protected from sunburn and cold temperatures and well maintained to avoid skin problems. The Chinese crested has an affectionate, playful nature and is valued as a pet.
