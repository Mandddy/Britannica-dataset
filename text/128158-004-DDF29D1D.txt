Hagenbeck Zoo, in full Carl Hagenbeck Zoo, German Carl Hagenbeck Tierpark,  zoological park in Hamburg, Ger., which pioneered the use of moated, barless, open-air enclosures that resemble the animalsâ€™ natural habitats. The zoo was founded in 1907 by Carl Hagenbeck, who originated the type of wild-animal acts characteristic of modern circus performances. Circuses and zoos the world over continue to purchase trained animals from the Hagenbeck Zoo, which maintains more than 2,000 specimens of about 300 species. The animals are exhibited on a geographic basis in the 67-acre (27-hectare) park. The zoo is privately owned by the Hagenbeck family.
