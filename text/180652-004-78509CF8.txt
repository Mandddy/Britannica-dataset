River Blackwater, Irish An Abhainn Mhór,  river rising in the uplands on the border of Counties Cork and Kerry, Ireland, and flowing 104 miles (167 km) to the sea at Youghal, County Cork. In its upper course the Blackwater flows between uplands and a sandstone ridge with summits above 2,200 feet (670 m). East–west lines of hills mark the entire upper course of the Blackwater, and so for most of its length the river flows west to east; but at Cappoquin, County Waterford, it suddenly turns southward and flows for the last 15 miles (24 km) of its course across the Drum Hills and the Youghal and Clashmore anticlines. Above Cappoquin the river’s broad valley is characterized by pastures, woodlands, and large estates. Below Cappoquin the river cuts across the grain of the land in a series of gorges and depressions. The Blackwater is noted for its trout and salmon fishing.
