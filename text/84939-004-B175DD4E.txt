Paris 1924 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Paris that took place May 4–July 27, 1924. The Paris Games were the seventh occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
The 1924 Games represented a coming of age for the Olympics. Held in Paris in tribute to Pierre, baron de Coubertin, the retiring president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and founder of the Olympic movement, the Games featured a high calibre of competition. International federations had gained more influence over their respective sports, standardizing the rules of competition, and national Olympic organizations in most countries conducted trials to ensure that the best athletes were sent to compete. More than 3,000 athletes, including more than 100 women, represented a record 44 countries. Fencing was added to the women’s events, although the total number of events decreased because of a reduction in the number of shooting and yachting competitions.
