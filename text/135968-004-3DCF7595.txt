Van Gogh Museum, museum in Amsterdam that is devoted to the life and work of Vincent van Gogh.
The Van Gogh Museum was opened in 1973 and consists of two buildings. Dutch architect Gerrit Rietveld, a member of the progressive art movement De Stijl, designed the main structure. In 1999 the museum opened the new Exhibition Wing, designed by the Japanese architect Kurokawa Kisho. Both buildings have an open design that emphasizes geometrical forms and allows much natural light into the exhibition space.
