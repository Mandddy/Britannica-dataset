Tate galleries, art museums in the United Kingdom that house the national collection of British art from the 16th century and the national collection of modern art. There are four branches: the Tate Britain and Tate Modern in London, the Tate Liverpool, and the Tate St. Ives in Cornwall.
The Tate Britain, located on the Millbank in the borough of Westminster, resulted from the benefaction of sugar tycoon Sir Henry Tate (1819–99), who gave both the building and his art collection to the nation. The Neoclassical building was designed by Sidney Smith and was opened to the public in 1897; it has received six extensions, the last of which, the Clore Gallery, opened in 1987 to house the world’s finest collection of works by the British painter J.M.W. Turner. Originally called the Tate Gallery, the museum changed its name to Tate Britain in 2000, when it began displaying only British art. The collection commences with Elizabethan and Jacobean examples. The 18th and 19th centuries are exceptionally well represented, including works by Reynolds, Gainsborough, Hogarth, Stubbs, Constable, Blake, and the Pre-Raphaelites.
