Wayne State University was formed in 1933 from the merger of several established colleges in Detroit. The oldest of these antecedents was the Detroit Medical College, founded in 1868 and now the School of Medicine. Detroit Teachers College (founded 1881) and the College of the City of Detroit (founded 1917) were also important antecedents of Wayne State. After the merger, the university was known as Wayne University, for Wayne county, which had been named for American Revolutionary War Gen. Anthony Wayne. It became Wayne State University in 1956. Notable alumni of Wayne State or its antecedents include writer Stephen Dobyns, poet and critic John Malcolm Brinnin, journalist Helen Thomas, and poet Robert Hayden.
