Populonia,  ancient Roman city that had originally been Etruscan and named Pupluna or Fufluna after the Etruscan wine god, Fufluns. It was situated on the western coast of central Italy on the Monte Massoncello Peninsula—the only large Etruscan city directly on the sea. The reason for the city’s existence is found in the vast slag remnants from the smelting of silver and iron ores from the nearby island of Elba. The city became wealthy and prominent and was the first city in Etruria to coin silver (second half of the 5th century bc).
The city was taken over by the Romans and suffered greatly in the wars between Rome and the Boii (282 bc) and later in the civil wars between Marius and Sulla in the 1st century bc. Afterward, the older part of the city, on the hills of Molino and Del Castello, was made a municipium. In the Middle Ages Populonia became a dependency of Lucca under the Lombards; at the end of the 8th century Charlemagne gave the city as a gift to Pope Hadrian I.
