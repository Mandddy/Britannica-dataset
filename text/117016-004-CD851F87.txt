Kennebec River, river in west-central Maine, U.S. The Kennebec rises from Moosehead Lake and flows south for about 150 miles (240 km) to the Atlantic Ocean. It was explored by Samuel de Champlain between 1604 and 1605. Fort St. George, founded in 1607 at the head of navigation on the river near present-day Augusta, was the state’s first English settlement. The river’s name is Algonquian for “long, quiet water” and describes the stretch of river below Augusta.
At one time, the Kennebec and Edwards Dam, built on the river in 1837, furnished hydropower at Bingham, Skowhegan, Waterville, and Gardiner. Growing environmental concerns, however, led the U.S. government to order the removal of the dam. After it was demolished in 1999, an upstream stretch of the river was reopened as an important spawning ground to such fish as the Atlantic salmon and short-nosed sturgeon. The Kennebec meets its main tributary, the Androscoggin River, northeast of Brunswick to form Merrymeeting Bay and then continues 16 miles (26 km) to the Atlantic Ocean.
