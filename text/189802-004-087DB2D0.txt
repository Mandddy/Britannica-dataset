Hari Krishen,  (born 1656, Kiratpur [now in Uttar Pradesh state], India—died 1664, Delhi) eighth Sikh Guru, who was installed at five years of age and reigned for only three years. He is said to have possessed vast wisdom and to have amazed visiting Brahmans (Hindu priests) with his great knowledge of the Hindu scripture Bhagavadgita. Many wondrous feats are attributed to him. A raja, Jai Singh, wishing to test the boy’s perception, sent one of his queens, disguised as a slave, to sit inconspicuously among slave girls at the Guru’s feet. Hari Krishen is said to have recognized her at once as the queen.
Hari Krishen’s older brother Ram Rai, already in favour with the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, protested Hari Krishen’s appointment as the Guru. Aurangzeb called the eight-year-old Hari Krishen to Delhi to decide the matter, and the boy arrived there during a severe cholera epidemic. After restoring many people to health, he himself fell ill with smallpox. As he was dying, the boy muttered the words “Baba Bakale,” meaning that his successor should be sought in the village of Bakala. After a search was conducted, Tegh Bahadur, son of Hargobind, the sixth Guru, was located in Bakala and anointed the ninth Guru.
