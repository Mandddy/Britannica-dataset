Sir Nevile Meyrick Henderson,  (born June 10, 1882, Horsham, Sussex, Eng.—died  Dec. 30, 1942, London) British ambassador in Berlin (1937–39) who was closely associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement toward Nazi Germany. Some observers believed that he was more influential in implementing the appeasement policy than Chamberlain himself.
Henderson joined the diplomatic service in 1905, serving as minister in Egypt (1924–28), France (1928–29), and Yugoslavia (1929–35). Promoted to ambassador to Argentina in 1935, he was transferred in 1937 to Germany. In Berlin he worked under severe nervous strain and was seriously ill in the winter of 1938. He was knighted in 1932 and made a privy councillor in 1937.
