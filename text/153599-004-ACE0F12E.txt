Aaron Rodgers, in full Aaron Charles Rodgers  (born December 2, 1983, Chico, California, U.S.) American professional gridiron football quarterback who led the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) to a Super Bowl championship in 2011.
Though Rodgers was a star quarterback at Pleasant Valley High School in Chico, he was not heavily recruited by college football teams. He played for a year at Butte College, a community college in nearby Oroville, before transferring in 2003 to the University of California, Berkeley. He soon took over as the starting quarterback for the school’s Golden Bears, and in 2004 he guided the team to a 10–2 record and a number nine ranking in the season’s final Associated Press poll. Rodgers was named first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference and was chosen by the Packers in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft. He then began a long apprenticeship as the team’s backup quarterback behind starter Brett Favre. In his first three seasons (2005–07) in the league, Rodgers saw only limited action, appearing in just seven games.
