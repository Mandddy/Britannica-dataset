Jean-Baptiste Bessières, duke d’Istrie,  (born Aug. 6, 1768, Prayssac, Fr.—died  May 1, 1813, Rippach, Saxony [Germany]) French soldier and, as one of Napoleon’s marshals, commander of the imperial guard after 1804. His appointment as marshal signaled Napoleon’s intention to develop the imperial guard.
In 1792 Bessières joined Louis XVI’s constitutional guard as a private. After serving in Catalonia as a captain, he was chosen to command Napoleon’s escort in Italy in 1796. He fought bravely at Aboukir, Egypt, in 1798 and two years later commanded 800 men of the consular guard at the Battle of Marengo (June 14). In 1805, with 9,000 guards, he led the famous charge against the Russian guard cavalry at Austerlitz (December 2).
