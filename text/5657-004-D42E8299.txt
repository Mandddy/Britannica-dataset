Echeveria,  genus of about 100 species of succulent plants, in the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae), native from Texas to Argentina. Many are popularly called hen-and-chickens because of the way new plantlets, or offsets, develop in a cluster around the parent plant. The usually broad fleshy leaves have waxy, velvety, or powdery surfaces and are often iridescent and sometimes red-edged when in bright sunlight. Echeverias are popular with collectors of succulent plants for their compact, symmetrical leaf rosettes and for the prominent stalked inflorescence (flower cluster), which usually rises high above the leaves.
The smaller species, such as the wax rosette (E. Ã— gilva), the pearl echeveria, also called Mexican snowball (E. elegans), and the plush plant (E. pulvinata), are handsome as small pot plants or in dish gardens along with other succulent species. Larger echeverias, such as E. gibbiflora, E. coccinea, and copper roses (E. multicaulis), are common in Mexican and southwestern American gardens.
