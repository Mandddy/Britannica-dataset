Sir Alexander Burnes,  (born May 16, 1805, Montrose, Forfarshire, Scotland—died November 2, 1841, Kabul, Afghanistan) British explorer and diplomat (of the same family as the poet Robert Burns) who gained renown for his explorations in what are now Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Iran. For his accomplishments he was knighted in 1839.
Burnes became interested in the geography of Afghanistan and central Asia while serving as an officer in the northwestern Indian state of Kutch (1823–29). He traveled in 1831 up the Indus River from Sind (Pakistan), delivering gifts to the local rulers, exploring the regions he visited, and eventually reaching the Punjab city of Lahore, now in Pakistan. The following year he began a journey that took him across Afghanistan, the Hindu Kush mountains, and Russian Turkistan to the city of Bukhara; his Persian travels led him to Meshed, Tehrān, and Bushire. The fame of his adventures preceded his return to London (1833) and earned him many honours, including a private audience with King William IV. In 1834 he published his Map of Central Asia and Travels into Bokhara. As a result of a political mission to Kabul (1836), he encouraged British India to support Dōst Moḥammed Khān on the Afghanistan throne. The government, however, chose to support the unpopular Shāh Shojāʿ’s claim to the throne (1839) and needed Burnes to help reinstate him.
