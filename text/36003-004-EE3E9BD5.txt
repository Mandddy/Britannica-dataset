François de La Mothe Le Vayer, pseudonym Orosius Tubero   (born 1588, Paris—died  1672, Paris) independent French thinker and writer who developed a philosophy of Skepticism more radical than that of Michel de Montaigne but less absolute than that of Pierre Bayle.
La Mothe Le Vayer became an avocat in the Parlement of Paris, taking over his father’s seat, but soon resigned when the attraction of belles lettres became stronger. His work La Contrariété d’humeur entre la nation française et l’espagnole (1636; “Conflicts of Interest Between the French and Spanish Nations”) and Considérations sur l’éloquence française (1638) earned him admission to the Académie Française in 1639. He was admired by the powerful Cardinal de Richelieu and was tutor to several noble youths, including from 1652 to 1657 Louis XIV, for whom he wrote a complete series of texts. The king rewarded him by appointing him historiographer of France and councillor of state.
