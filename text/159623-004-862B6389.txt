John Jay Chapman,  (born March 2, 1862, New York, New York, U.S.—died November 4, 1933, Poughkeepsie, New York) American poet, dramatist, and critic who attacked the get-rich-quick morality of the post-Civil War “Gilded Age” in political action and in his writings. Ancestors on both sides of his family had distinguished themselves in antislavery and other causes, and he sought to continue that tradition among the upper middle classes, whose integrity he felt had been eroded by the upsurge of big business.
Chapman’s father was a Wall Street executive who was for a time president of the New York Stock Exchange. At age 14 Chapman went to St. Paul’s School, Concord, New Hampshire, but he broke down physically and mentally and returned home to complete his preparatory education with tutors. After graduating from Harvard in 1885, he traveled in Europe and then returned to Harvard Law School. In 1887 he assaulted a man for his supposed insulting attentions to the woman who later became Chapman’s wife. In remorse Chapman plunged his left hand into a fire and injured it so severely that it had to be amputated.
