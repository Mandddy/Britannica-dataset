Trapezus, one of the most easterly of ancient Greek settlements, was probably founded in 756 bce by colonists from Sinope (modern Sinop). Like many other Black Sea sites, it is associated in legend with the Amazon women warriors. Trabzon is said to be the site on which the army called the Ten Thousand by the writer Xenophon, who was one of its members, reached the sea after its long march that followed defeat in 401 bce.
