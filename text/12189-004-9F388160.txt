John Graham of Claverhouse, 1st viscount of Dundee,  (born 1649?—died  July 17/18, 1689, Pass of Killiecrankie, Perth, Scot.) Scottish soldier, known as “Bonnie Dundee,” who in 1689 led an uprising in support of the deposed Roman Catholic monarch James II of Great Britain. Graham’s death at the outset of the revolt deprived the Scottish Jacobites, as James’s adherents were called, of any hope of success in their resistance to King William III and Queen Mary II.
Coming from a noble family, Graham began his military career as a soldier of fortune in France and the Netherlands. He returned to Scotland by 1678 and was made captain of the dragoons sent to the southwest to suppress Presbyterian insurgents who opposed the Anglican regime of King Charles II. Although beaten by the rebels at Drumclog Moss, Lanark, on June 1, 1679, Graham helped defeat them at Bothwell Bridge on June 22.
