Denbighshire, Welsh Sir Ddinbych,  county of northern Wales extending inland from the Irish Sea coast. The present county of Denbighshire includes the Vale of Clwyd along the River Clwyd and an inland area between the Clwydian Range in the east and the Clocaenog Forest in the west that ascends to the Berwyn mountains in the south. The lower Vale of Clywd and the seacoast are part of the historic county of Flintshire (Sir Fflint). The southernmost portion of the present county, bordering the Berwyn range, belongs to the historic county of Merioneth (Meirionnydd). The remaining central portion of the present county constitutes only a part of the historic county of Denbighshire, which also encompasses the eastern portion of the county borough of Conwy, most of the county borough of Wrexham, and a small northern section of the county of Powys. Ruthin is the county’s administrative centre.
The Vale of Clwyd and the upper reaches of the River Dee have been focuses of human settlement since ancient times. The discovery of the hill fort of Pen-y-Corddyn in the hills just south of the village of Llanddulas provides evidence of Iron Age settlement. An important ancient route along the North Wales coast passed through the historic county of Denbighshire, which was the site of two Roman roads. Evidence indicates that the Romans mined lead in the area. In the southeast is a section of Offa’s Dyke, an earthwork that marked the boundary between Wales (west) and England (east). Among the county’s medieval monuments is the beautiful, ruined Valle Crucis Abbey (founded by the Cistercians c. 1200), near Llangollen.
