Toy, plaything, usually for an infant or child; often an instrument used in a game. Toys, playthings, and games survive from the most remote past and from a great variety of cultures. The ball, kite, and yo-yo are assumed to be the oldest objects specifically designed as toys. Toys vary from the simplest to the most complex things, from the stick selected by a child and imagined to be a hobbyhorse to sophisticated and complex mechanical devices. Coordination and other manual skills develop from cumulative childhood experiences received by manipulating toys such as marbles, jackstones, and other objects that require the use of hands and bodies. Mental agility, beginning in childhood, is challenged by puzzles of spatial relationships.
Objects with human and animal forms that may have been toys have been found in deposits from ancient Sumer dating to 2600 bc. The earliest-known written historical mention of a toy comes from about 500 bc in a Greek reference to yo-yos made from wood, metal, or painted terra-cotta. It is believed, however, that the yo-yo originated in China at a much earlier date. In addition, the kite, still a popular plaything in China, existed as a toy there at least as early as 1000 bc. In India, clay animal-figures on wheels and other animal toys date to about 2500 bc. Later, brass and bronze horses and elephants were common playthings among Indian children from wealthy families.
