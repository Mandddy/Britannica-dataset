Paul Harvey, in full Paul Harvey Aurandt  (born Sept. 4, 1918, Tulsa, Okla., U.S.—died Feb. 28, 2009, Phoenix, Ariz.) American radio commentator and news columnist noted for his firm staccato delivery and his conservative but individualistic opinions on current events. He enjoyed an almost unparalleled longevity as a national broadcaster.
Harvey was descended from five generations of Baptist preachers. He and his sister were brought up by their mother after their father was shot to death under uncertain circumstances. At age 14 he landed a menial job at KVOO radio in Tulsa, and he was soon doing voice work there. He studied briefly at the University of Tulsa but quit to work full-time in radio; by age 25 he had gained experience at stations across the Plains and the Midwest and had covered the activities of the U.S. military for the Office of War Information. In 1940 he married Lynne (“Angel”) Cooper, who afterward took control of his business affairs. Following a medical discharge from the Army Air Corps in 1944, he shortened his name to Paul Harvey and began broadcasting for Chicago radio station WENR. Paul Harvey News and Comment proved immediately popular in Chicago and was nationally syndicated by the American Broadcasting Company in 1951. In 1976 the program spun off The Rest of the Story, whose brief biographical narratives were written by the Harveys’ only child, Paul Harvey Aurandt, Jr.
