Shrimpfish, also called razorfish,  any of four species of small, tropical marine fishes of the family Centriscidae (order Gasterosteiformes), found in the Indo-Pacific. The name razorfish derives from the shrimpfishesâ€™ characteristic sharp-edged belly. Shrimpfishes are nearly transparent, long-snouted, shrimplike fishes, flattened from side to side and covered with a cuirass of fused, transparent armour plates. The armour ends in a long spine (one of the dorsal fin spines), beneath which are the tail and the rest of the dorsal fins.
Shrimpfishes characteristically swim in a vertical position, with their head down, but in a cave or similar enclosure, they swim head-up, oriented toward the roof. The species vary in length from about 14 cm (5 1/2 inches) to about 30 cm (about 12 inches).
