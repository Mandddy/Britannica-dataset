Pearl White, in full Pearl Fay White  (born March 4, 1889, Green Ridge, Mo., U.S.—died Aug. 4, 1938, Paris, France) one of the most successful of the early American film stars, who gained international fame for her work in “chapter stories”—long-running melodramatic serials, such as The Perils of Pauline.
White left high school in her second year to join a local theatrical stock company, and at age 18 she joined a traveling theatrical troupe. In 1910, when her voice began to fail, she decided to seek a career in films and joined the Powers Film Company in the Bronx, New York City. In the next 13 years she made more than 100 comedies, serials, and westerns.
