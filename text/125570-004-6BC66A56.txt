Frying, the cooking of food in hot fats or oils, usually done with a shallow oil bath in a pan over a fire or as so-called deep fat frying, in which the food is completely immersed in a deeper vessel of hot oil. Because the food is heated through a greasy medium, some authorities consider frying to be technically a dry-heat cooking process.
The technique of frying is ancient, ubiquitous, and highly versatile; it has been used since antiquity and in most cultures to prepare meats and fish, vegetables, and breads. This popularity, together with the fairly low cost of large-scale frying, made fried foods the staples of the late 20th-century fast-food industry.
