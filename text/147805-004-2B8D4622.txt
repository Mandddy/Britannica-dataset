Bertrand Piccard,  (born March 1, 1958, Lausanne, Switzerland) Swiss aviator who on March 20, 1999, with copilot Brian Jones, completed the first nonstop circumnavigation of the globe by balloon. The trip, begun by Piccard and Jones on March 1 aboard the Breitling Orbiter 3, took 19 days 21 hours 55 minutes to complete. Starting in the Swiss Alps, the balloon carried the pair over Europe, Africa, Asia, Central America, and the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Piccard, the captain of the Breitling Orbiter 3, was the grandson of Auguste Piccard, who was the first person to reach the stratosphere by balloon, and the son of Jacques Piccard, who designed and piloted bathyscaphes for deep-sea exploration. He became an expert hang-gliding pilot as a child and later piloted ultralight planes and hot-air balloons. Although he trained as a psychiatrist and established a practice in Lausanne, he continued to devote a large part of his time to ballooning. In 1992 Piccard and Wim Verstraeten crossed the Atlantic Ocean, winning the Chrysler Transatlantic Challenge. The pair made two unsuccessful attempts to circle the globe: the first, in 1997, ended with a fuel leak that released toxic fumes into their cabin; and the second try, a 1998 flight in the Breitling Orbiter 2, ended in a rice paddy in Myanmar (Burma).
