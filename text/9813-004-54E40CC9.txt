Nippur, modern Niffer, or Nuffar,  ancient city of Mesopotamia, now in southeastern Iraq. It lies northeast of the town of Ad-Dīwānīyah. Although never a political capital, Nippur played a dominant role in the religious life of Mesopotamia.
In Sumerian mythology Nippur was the home of Enlil, the storm god and representation of force and the god who carried out the decrees of the assembly of gods that met at Nippur. Enlil, according to one account, created man at Nippur. Although a king’s armies might subjugate the country, the transference to that king of Enlil’s divine power to rule had to be sought and sanctioned. The necessity of this confirmation made the city and Enlil’s sanctuary there especially sacred, regardless of which dynasty ruled Mesopotamia.
