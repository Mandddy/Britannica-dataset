Ludvig Anselm Nordström,  (born Feb. 25, 1882, Härnösand, Swed.—died  April 15, 1942, Stockholm) Swedish writer whose realistic, socially conscious works are set in the Norrland region in which he matured.
Born of a Swedish father and an English mother, Nordström was much influenced by English writers, especially Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, Laurence Sterne, H.G. Wells, and G.K. Chesterton. He most delighted his readers with such freshly observed, idiomatic, and lively short stories as those found in Fiskare (1907; “Fishermen”), Borgare (1909; “Burghers”), Herrar (1910; “Gentlemen”), and Lumpsamlaren (1910; “The Junk Collector”). His three-volume Petter Svensks historia (1923–27; “The Story of Peter Svensk”) is the chief work in which he expounds his vision (which he called “totalism”) of an anti-individualistic, industrial society in which group and communal values are stressed. In this and other long works of fiction, his sociopolitical views were often put forward at the expense of his art, and most of his long fiction is not memorable. He was able to achieve a certain measure of political influence, however, with two journalistic essays: Bonde-nöden (1933; “The Distress of the Peasantry”) and Lort-Sverige (1938; “Dirt-Sweden”), dealing with the limits of common rural existence and with the filth of the supposedly “clean” Swedish countryside. Both aroused widespread discussion and, together with the contemporaneous economic studies of Gunnar and Alva Myrdal, helped to prompt subsequent reforms. Only two of Nordström’s novels, Landsorts-bohème (1928; “Small-town Bohemia”) and Planeten Markatten (1937; “The Monkey Planet”), are considered to be of value.
