Joe Namath, byname of Joseph William Namath, also called Joe Willie or Broadway Joe  (born May 31, 1943, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American collegiate and professional gridiron football quarterback who was one of the best passers in football and a cultural sports icon of the 1960s.
Namath excelled in several sports as a youth in the steel-mill town of Beaver Falls, near Pittsburgh. He played football at the University of Alabama (1962–64) under coach Bear Bryant, a famous developer of quarterbacks. While playing in college, he sustained the first of many knee injuries that ultimately shortened his career. The National Football League (NFL) and the American Football League (AFL) competed for him as a first-round draft choice, and he went to the AFL New York Jets with an unprecedented three-year contract for more than $400,000. He became the Jets’ starting quarterback midway through his first season, and in 1967 he threw for a record 4,007 yards.
