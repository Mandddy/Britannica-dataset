Umbrellabird,  any of three species of cotingas (family Cotingidae, order Passeriformes) of tropical American forests. They are notable for their unique, umbrella-like crest and for the pendant suspended from the throat, which is an inflatable wattle. When displaying, the male spreads the crest to cover his head and, at the same time, makes rumbling noises.
The three species are black and 38–50 cm (15–20 inches) long. All spend most of their lives in the canopies of tall trees. In the ornate umbrellabird (C. ornatus) of the Amazon basin, the wattle is short, triangular, and devoid of feathers on the hindside. In the long-wattled umbrellabird (Cephalopterus penduliger), found west of the Andes in Ecuador and Colombia, the wattle may be 28 cm (11 inches) long and is entirely shingled with short, black feathers. The bare-necked umbrellabird (C. glabricollis) of Panama and Costa Rica has a short, round wattle, which is bright red and unfeathered. The latter two species are considered by some authorities to be subspecies of C. ornatus.
