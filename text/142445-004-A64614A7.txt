Carnivore, also called predator,  animal whose diet consists of other animals. Adaptations for a carnivorous diet include a variety of hunting behaviours and the development of methods for grasping or otherwise immobilizing the prey. Wolves use their teeth for grasping, owls their claws, and bullfrogs their tongues. Some snakes (e.g., rattlesnakes) use venom to immobilize their prey, and many spiders wrap their victims in thread. Most carnivores are larger than their prey species, although some of the largest carnivores prey on even larger speciesâ€”for example, tigers on water buffalo and orcas on baleen whales.
Many well-known predators (e.g., lions, weasels, dogs) belong to the mammalian order Carnivora. However, carnivorous mammals are also found in many other orders, including the Insectivora, Cetacea, Marsupialia, and Chiroptera. Likewise, not all mammals in the classification Carnivora are exclusively carnivores.
