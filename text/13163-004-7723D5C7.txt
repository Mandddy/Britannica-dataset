True Cross, Christian relic, reputedly the wood of the cross on which Jesus Christ was crucified. Legend relates that the True Cross was found by St. Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land about 326.
The earliest historical reference to veneration of the True Cross occurs in the mid-4th century. By the 8th century the accounts were enriched by legendary details describing the history of the wood of the cross before it was used for the Crucifixion.
