Sand shark, any of about three species of sharks of the genera Carcharias and Odontaspis in the family Odontaspididae. Sand sharks are found in shallow water, usually at or near the bottom, along tropical and temperate coastlines of all oceans. They range from about 3 to 6 metres (10 to 20 feet) in length and are brown or gray above, paler below. Voracious, but generally sluggish, they have long, slim, pointed teeth and prey on fishes and invertebrates. Sand sharks are potentially dangerous to humans.
The ragged-tooth sharks, O. ferox and O. noronhai, are largely deep-water species and are infrequently encountered.
