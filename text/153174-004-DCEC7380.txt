J. Bruce Ismay, in full Joseph Bruce Ismay  (born December 12, 1862, Crosby, near Liverpool, England—died October 17, 1937, London) British businessman who was chairman of the White Star Line and who survived the sinking of the company’s ship Titanic in 1912.
Ismay was the eldest son of Thomas Henry Ismay, who owned the White Star Line, which operated a fleet of passenger ships. After his father’s death in 1899, he became chairman of the company. Under his direction, White Star became known for its luxury liners. In 1902 he oversaw the company’s acquisition by John Pierpont Morgan’s International Mercantile Marine Company (IMM). As part of the deal, Ismay continued as chairman of White Star, and in 1904 he also became president of IMM. In 1907 Ismay attended a dinner with William James Pirrie—who controlled the Belfast shipbuilding company Harland and Wolff, which constructed all of White Star’s vessels—and the two men reportedly devised a plan to build a class of large luxury ships to compete with the Cunard Line for the highly profitable transatlantic passenger trade. The Olympic was the first to be completed (1911), and it was an immediate success. The Titanic followed in 1912.
