Robert L. Stanfield, in full Robert Lorne Stanfield  (born April 11, 1914, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada—died December 16, 2003, Ottawa) Canadian politician who, as leader of the Progressive Conservative Association in Nova Scotia, served as that province’s premier from 1956 to 1967.
After graduating in 1939 from Harvard University Law School, Stanfield was called to the bar in 1940. From 1939 to 1945 he served on the Halifax staff of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. In 1947 he became president of the provincial Progressive Conservative Association, a party that held no seats in the local legislature. The following year he became provincial party leader, and in 1949 he was elected to the legislature for Colchester county. Noted for his honesty and intelligence, he led his party to victory in 1956, ending 23 years of uninterrupted Liberal rule. Stanfield took up the posts of premier, provincial treasurer, and minister of education. Among his accomplishments were the modernization of the education and health-care systems in Nova Scotia. After resigning in 1967, he served as a member of Parliament for Halifax, Nova Scotia, from 1968 to 1979. Until 1976 he led the federal Conservative party in the House of Commons and, as its leader, continuously attacked Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau’s economic policies. Known as the best prime minister Canada never had, Stanfield sought the office in 1968, 1972, and 1974 but was defeated by Trudeau in each election. Stanfield subsequently served as chairman of the Institute for Research on Public Policy.
