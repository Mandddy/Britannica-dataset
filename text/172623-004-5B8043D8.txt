Michiel Adriaanszoon De Ruyter,  (born March 24, 1607, Vlissingen, United Provinces [Netherlands]—died April 29, 1676, Syracuse, Sicily [Italy]) Dutch seaman and one of his country’s greatest admirals. His brilliant naval victories in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars enabled the United Provinces to maintain a balance of power with England.
Employed at sea at the age of nine, De Ruyter by 1635 had become a merchant captain. After serving as rear admiral of a Dutch fleet assisting Portugal against Spain in 1641, he returned to the merchant service for the next 10 years, fighting against the Barbary pirates off the north African coast. With the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54), he accepted a naval command, serving with distinction under Maarten Tromp and attaining the rank of vice admiral in 1653 after his victory off Texel. De Ruyter’s successes in battle have been attributed to his development of an effective combat order, stressing fleet discipline.
