Johann Strauss, the Younger,  (born Oct. 25, 1825, Vienna, Austria—died  June 3, 1899, Vienna) “the Waltz King,” a composer famous for his Viennese waltzes and operettas.
Strauss was the eldest son of the composer Johann Strauss the Elder. Because his father wished him to follow a nonmusical profession, he started his career as a bank clerk. He studied the violin without his father’s knowledge, however, and in 1844 conducted his own dance band at a Viennese restaurant. In 1849, when the elder Strauss died, Johann combined his orchestra with his father’s and went on a tour that included Russia (1865–66) and England (1869), winning great popularity. In 1870 he relinquished leadership of his orchestra to his brothers, Josef and Eduard, in order to spend his time writing music. In 1872 he conducted concerts in New York City and Boston.
