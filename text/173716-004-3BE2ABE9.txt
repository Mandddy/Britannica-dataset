Ulrich Ochsenbein, in full Johann Ulrich Ochsenbein   (born November 24, 1811, Schwarzenegg, Switzerlandâ€”died November 3, 1890, Bellevue, Bern) Swiss politician and military leader who headed the confederation government during the Sonderbund War (1847) and presided over the constitutional reform committee of 1848.
An ardent Bernese radical, Ochsenbein organized and directed an abortive military coup against the clerical government of Luzern (March 1845), precipitating the formation by Roman Catholic cantons of a conservative defense league, the Sonderbund. At Bern he championed the revision of the cantonal constitution (1846) and headed the department of the army. As president of the Bernese government (1847), he simultaneously presided over the confederation Diet during the proscription of the Sonderbund (July 1847) and the initial phase of the subsequent civil war.
