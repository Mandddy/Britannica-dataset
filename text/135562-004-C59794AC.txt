Silas Deane,  (born Dec. 24, 1737, Groton, Conn.—died  Sept. 23, 1789, at sea near Deal, Kent, Eng.) first U.S. diplomat sent abroad (1776), who helped secure much-needed French aid for the American Revolutionary cause.
Admitted to the bar in 1761, Deane served as a delegate from Connecticut to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia (1774–76). Congress then sent him to France as a secret agent to obtain financial and military assistance and to investigate the possibility of an alliance. He obtained and sent arms valued at more than 6,000,000 livres to America, an important contribution to the decisive victory over the British at Saratoga (October 1777). In November 1777 Congress recalled Deane, but before leaving Paris he signed the treaties of commerce and alliance (Feb. 6, 1778) that he and two other commissioners, Arthur Lee and Benjamin Franklin, had negotiated. Upon his return he was accused of embezzlement and disloyalty on the basis of insinuations by Lee that Deane was charging for supplies that France intended as gifts to America. Although never proved, the accusations led to his ruin.
