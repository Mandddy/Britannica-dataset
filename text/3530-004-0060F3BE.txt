Nicola Pisano,  (born c. 1220, Apulia?—died 1278/84, Pisa?) sculptor whose work, along with that of his son Giovanni and other artists employed in their workshops, created a new sculptural style for the late 13th and the 14th centuries in Italy.
Pisano’s origins are unclear. He is first recorded in 1260 in Pisa (or perhaps 1259, if corrections are made for the medieval Pisan calendar), but documents of 1266 twice call him “Master Nicola from Apulia,” Apulia being the province located in the southeastern section of the Italian peninsula. While most scholars now accept an Apulian birth for Pisano, there is still little known about his artistic training. His sculptural training, in line with medieval practices, was probably obtained through an apprenticeship in an already established workshop. If he began his training in Apulia he would most likely have been taught by one of the army of craftsmen whom the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II had employed to decorate his vast new building projects. Frederick’s artists consciously imitated an ancient Roman style of sculpture in order to give visual support to his role as the Holy Roman emperor. If on the other hand, Pisano had actually left Apulia before receiving his sculptural training, he might have apprenticed himself to either local Tuscan or Lombard workshops; strong echoes of both regional styles appear in his work.
