University of Cologne, German Universität Zu Köln,  autonomous, state-supported coeducational institution of higher learning in Cologne, Ger., founded in 1388 as a municipal university. In spite of Protestant influences, the university became a centre of German Roman Catholicism.
The University of Cologne was abolished by the French in 1798 after they had occupied Cologne. The university was refounded in 1919 as an autonomous, state-supported institution by Konrad Adenauer, who was then lord mayor of Cologne. It flourished until the loss of academic freedom under Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich (1933–45). The university was closed again in 1945 until 1953, when it was reopened under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education of North Rhine–Westphalia state. It has faculties of economics and social sciences, law, medicine, philosophy, mathematics and natural sciences, education, and special education and therapies.
