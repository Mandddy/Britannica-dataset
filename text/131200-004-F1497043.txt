Sea cave,  cave formed in a cliff by wave action of an ocean or lake. Sea caves occur on almost every cliffed headland or coast where the waves break directly on a rock cliff and are formed by mechanical erosion rather than the chemical solution process that is responsible for the majority of inland caves. Zones of weakness in the cliff give way under the force of the waves and are eroded out; these cavities are enlarged by the hydraulic pressure built up by each wave. Holes, commonly known as blowholes, may eventually be forced through the roof of the cave to allow the pressure created by each wave to be released as a jet of spray.
