Albertinum, museum in Dresden, Ger., displaying fine art and national treasures. It is one of several institutions associated with the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.
The Albertinum, named for King Albert of Saxony, was built on the foundations of a former armoury by Karl Adolf Canzler, who completed construction in 1887. The building was destroyed in World War II but reopened in 1953. The Albertinum is one of several historical buildings occupying Dresden’s famous Kultur Quartier (“Cultural District”). Other notable buildings include the Semper Opera House, the Royal Palace, and Dresden’s reconstructed Baroque cathedral, the Frauenkirche.
