The American copper (Lycaena phleas) is the most common species in North America. Its larvae feed on clover, dock, or sorrel. Adults are delicate, with an 18- to 38-mm (0.75- to 1.5-inch) wingspan. They are rapid fliers and are usually distinguished by iridescent wings. The male’s forelegs are reduced, but the female’s are fully developed.
