Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), large, potentially dangerous shark of the family Carcharhinidae. It is noted for its voracity and inveterate scavenging, as well as its reputation as a man-eater. The tiger shark is found worldwide in warm oceans, from the shoreline to the open sea. A maximum of about 5.5 metres (18 feet) long, it is grayish and patterned, when young, with dark spots and vertical bars. It has a long, pointed upper tail lobe and large, saw-edged teeth that are deeply notched along one side.
An omnivorous feeder that sometimes damages the nets and catches of fishermen, the tiger shark eats fishes, other sharks, sea turtles, mollusks, seabirds, carrion, and garbage. It has also been known to swallow coal, tin cans, bones, and clothing. It is of some commercial value as a source of leather and liver oil.
