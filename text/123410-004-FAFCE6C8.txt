Lorenzo Maitani,  (born c. 1275, near Siena, Republic of Siena [Italy]—died June 1330, Orvieto, Papal States) Italian architect and sculptor primarily responsible for the construction and decoration of the facade of Orvieto Cathedral.
Maitani established his reputation in Siena and was called to supervise the construction at Orvieto in 1308 when the unprecedented height and span of the cathedral’s vaults and arches presented unforeseen difficulties. In 1310 he received the title capomaestro of the cathedral and became, in addition, overseer of bridges and civic buildings.
