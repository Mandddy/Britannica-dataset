Doi Takako,  (born November 30, 1928, Kōbe, Japan—died September 20, 2014, Hyōgo prefecture) Japanese politician, educator, and head (1986–91) of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP; in 1991–96 called the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], later simplified to Social Democratic Party). She was the first woman ever to head a political party in Japan.
Doi attended Dōshisha University in Kyōto, and after her graduation she taught constitutional law there. She was elected to the House of Representatives (lower house of the Diet [parliament]) in 1969. After the JSP, the second largest party in Japan’s multiparty system, suffered a major defeat in the general elections of 1986, Doi was asked to lead the party. From the outset of her leadership she attempted to bring the party more into the mainstream on such divisive issues as national defense and nuclear power.
