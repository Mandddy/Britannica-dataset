Portico,  colonnaded porch or entrance to a structure, or a covered walkway supported by regularly spaced columns. Porticoes formed the entrances to ancient Greek temples.
The portico is a principal feature of Greek temple architecture and thus a prominent element in Roman and all subsequent classically inspired structures. The types of portico furnish the main terms for describing Greek temples. There are two basic plans. If the long walls of a temple extend past the cella, or sanctuary, to form the side walls of the porch or anteroom, these long walls often terminate with antas, an anta being a corner post or pilaster. The open end of the porch, or portico, is then supported by between one and four columns in antis, that is to say, “between the antas.” The temples so constructed are called henostyle (one column), distyle (two columns), tristyle (three columns), or tetrastyle (four columns). No more than four columns were ever used.
