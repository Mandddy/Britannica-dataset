Saint Thomas de Cantelupe, also called Thomas Of Cantelupe, or Thomas Of Hereford, Cantelupe also spelled Cantilupe  (born c. 1218, Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 25, 1282, Montefiascone, near Orvieto, Papal States; canonized 1320, feast day October 3) reformist, educator, English church prelate, bishop, and defender of episcopal jurisdiction who played an important role in the Barons’ War.
Thomas was of noble birth; after being ordained at Lyon, c. 1245, he continued his studies in France at Orléans and Paris. He then taught canon law at Paris and at Oxford, where in 1262 he became chancellor. When Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, won the Barons’ War (1264), he appointed Thomas chancellor of England in 1265. After Montfort’s death on the following August 4 and after the baronial party’s subsequent disintegration, Thomas was dismissed and returned to Paris (1265–72). He was then at Oxford for a second term as chancellor (1273–74). Known for his ascetic life, strict discipline, and martial spirit, he was made (1275) bishop of Hereford, which he found in a state of deterioration. He restored his see, began a reform, and became adviser to King Edward I of England.
