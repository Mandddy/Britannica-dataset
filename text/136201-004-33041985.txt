Susquehanna River, one of the longest rivers of the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. It rises in Otsego Lake, central New York state, and winds through the Appalachian Mountains in New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland before flowing into the head of Chesapeake Bay at Havre de Grace, Md. About 444 miles (715 km) long, the river and its tributaries (which include the Chemung, Lackawanna, West Branch of the Susquehanna, and Juniata rivers) drain an area of 27,570 square miles (71,410 square km). Though the river itself never served as an important waterway, because of rapids and other obstructions, its valley was significant as a land route to the Ohio River system and later as a focus of coal mining. The Susquehanna is the potential source of waterpower in the eastern United States; hydroelectric power plants have been built at Holtwood, York Haven, and Safe Harbor, Pa., and Conowingo, Md. Main riverine cities include Binghamton, N.Y., and Wilkes-Barre, Scranton (on the Lackawanna), Williamsport (on the West Branch), and Harrisburg, Pa.
