DeBrazza’s monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus), large brightly coloured guenon widely distributed through central Africa and into Ethiopia and western Kenya, particularly in forests near rivers and swamps. DeBrazza’s monkey is a white-bearded primate with speckled yellow-gray fur and a white stripe along each thigh. Hands, feet, and tail are black. On the forehead is a browband of white-tipped red hairs surmounted by a black band; the cheek fur is grizzled black and yellow. DeBrazza’s monkey is rather heavy-set, with females weighing 4 kg (9 pounds) and males 7.5 kg. It has a less lively nature than some of the other guenons and is less arboreal, living more on the forest floor.
