Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), lepidopteran that is a serious pest of both deciduous and evergreen trees.
The European strain was accidentally introduced into eastern North America about 1869, and by 1889 it had become a serious pest of deciduous forests and fruit trees. By the end of the 20th century the moth had spread to the western Great Lakes region. Damage is less severe in its original European range, where the moth has several natural enemies.
