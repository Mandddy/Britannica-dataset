Transport and General Workers’ Union (TGWU), also called T&amp;G,  labour union that was the largest in Great Britain throughout much of the 20th century. It originated in 1889 with the formation of the Dockers’ Union. In 1922 that union led the merger of 14 unions to form an organization representing more than 300,000 workers. A dominant influence in the TGWU’s formation and growth was Ernest Bevin, the union’s first general secretary (1922–40).
As a general union, the TGWU maintained a policy of enrolling workers who had been excluded by the rigid requirements of the craft unions. As a result, the TGWU underwent remarkable growth, with membership exceeding two million in the 1970s. Members came from nearly all of the transportation industries (except railroads) and from automobile, construction, chemical, textile, and other industries. By organizing both semiskilled and unskilled workers, especially in smaller manufacturing trades, the general unions such as the TGWU represented workers traditionally ignored by the craft unions and industrial unions.
