Rowboat,  boat propelled by oars alone, probably the most common type of boat found around waterfronts and at most fishing camps and docks on inland waters.
A true rowboat or sculling boat has an easy motion through the water and, most important, glides between strokes. Thus the boatâ€™s forward motion never ceases; each stroke of the oar keeps the boat underway, and a steady tempo of strokes can be kept up hour after hour. Boats are rowed in one of two ways: either the rower sits facing the stern and pulls with his arms and back, or he faces ahead, letting his weight fall forward on the oars. Sometimes the boat is sculled by one oar over the stern. A special type of rowboat, used solely in competitive racing, is the single-, double-, or eight-oared racing shell, a long frail craft, specially equipped with seats that enable the rower or rowers to put maximum power into each sweep of the long scull or oar.
