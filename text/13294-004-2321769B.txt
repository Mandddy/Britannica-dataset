Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville, countess d’Aulnoy,  Aulnoy also spelled Aunoy   (born 1650/51, near Honfleur, Fr.—died  Jan. 14, 1705, Paris) writer of fairy tales and of novels of court intrigue, whose personal intrigues were commensurate with those described in her books.
Shortly after her marriage as a young girl in 1666, Marie d’Aulnoy conspired with her mother and their two lovers to accuse falsely Marie’s husband, a middle-aged financier, of high treason. When the plot miscarried, she was forced to spend the next 15 years out of the country, leading a peripatetic existence in Spain, the Netherlands, and England before returning to Paris and beginning her literary career in 1685. Her best-remembered works are Contes de fées (1697; “Fairy Tales”) and Les Contes nouveaux ou les fées à la mode (1698; “New Tales, or the Fancy of the Fairies”), written in the manner of the great fairy tales of Charles Perrault but laced with her own sardonic touch. Her pseudo-historical novels, which were immensely popular throughout Europe, include Hippolyte, comte de Douglas (1690; Hippolitus, Earl of Douglas), Memoires de la cour d’Espagne (1690; Memoirs from the Court of Spain), and Relation du voyage d’Espagne (1691; Travels into Spain). An English-language translation of her works, including the fairy tales, was published in four volumes in 1707. The fairy tales were frequently reprinted.
