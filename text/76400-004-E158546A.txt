Tallulah Bankhead, in full Tallulah Brockman Bankhead  (born January 31, 1902, Huntsville, Ala., U.S.â€”died December 12, 1968, New York, N.Y.) American actress who was as famous for her offstage shenanigans as for her theatrical achievements.
Bankhead, the daughter of Alabama congressman and future speaker of the House William Brockman Bankhead, was named after the town of Tallulah Falls, Georgia. In spite of a strict convent education, Bankhead was a willful, headstrong child with a remarkable facility for attracting attention. After winning a local beauty contest at age 15, she submitted her photograph to a movie fan magazine and, as a result, landed bit roles in a few silent films made in 1918. That same year, she made her Broadway debut in Squab Farm. Though she lacked training and discipline, she possessed a dazzling stage presence, her husky voice providing fascinating contrast with her gorgeous face and figure. Quickly ascending to stardom, she just as easily gained renown for her quick-witted outspokenness and indefatigable partygoing.
