Tiruvalluvar, also spelled Thiruvalluvar, also called Valluvar  (flourished c. 1st century bc or 6th century ad, India) Tamil poet-saint known as the author of the Tirukkural (“Sacred Couplets”), considered a masterpiece of human thought, compared in India and abroad to the Bible, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, and the works of Plato.
Little is known about the life of Tiruvalluvar except that he is believed to have lived in Mylapore (now part of Chennai [formerly Madras], Tamil Nadu, India) with his wife, Vasuki. He was probably a Jain ascetic of humble origins who worked as a weaver. Both Buddhists and Shaivites, however, claim him as their own, and he is especially revered by those of low caste.
