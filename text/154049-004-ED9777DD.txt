Max von Sydow, original name Carl Adolf von Sydow  (born April 10, 1929, Lund, Sweden) Swedish stage and screen actor perhaps best known for his dour brooding characterizations in films of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.
Interested in the theatre from childhood, von Sydow studied at the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm (1948–51). He established his reputation as one of Sweden’s most promising young actors at the Norrköping-Linköping Municipal Theatre (1951–53). He then gained popularity at the Municipal Theatre in Helsingborg (1953–55), the Municipal Theatre of Malmö (1955–60), and the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm (1960–62), where he appeared in productions as varied as William Shakespeare’s King John and Arthur Miller’s After the Fall.
