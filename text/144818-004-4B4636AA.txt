Neosho River,  river rising north of Council Grove in Morris county, Kan., U.S., and flowing generally southeast into Oklahoma, where it is also known as the Grand, to join the Arkansas River, near Fort Gibson, after a course of about 460 miles (740 km).
It has a drainage area of 12,660 square miles (32,789 square km), and flow at its mouth varies from 133,000 cubic feet (3,800 cubic m) per second to as little as 35 cubic feet (1 cubic m).
