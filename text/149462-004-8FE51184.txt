Maine,  historic region encompassing the western French départements of Mayenne and Sarthe and coextensive with the former province of Maine. The two Gallo-Roman civitates of the Cenomani and of the Diablintes were merged in the middle of the 5th century into the single pagus, or district, of Le Mans. Hereditary counts, beginning with the warlord Roger in the 890s, acquired power in the province, but in the 11th century their countship was compressed between Normandy and Anjou. Maine fell to Anjou early in the 12th century and then, with Anjou and Normandy, to the French king Philip II Augustus at the beginning of the 13th. Later held by Naples, Maine reverted to the French crown in 1481. In the centuries before the Revolution in 1789, Maine was a province under a military governor, with his seat at Le Mans, but it was administered, with Anjou and Touraine, by the intendant of the généralité of Tours.
Maine comprises portions of the crystalline uplands of the Massif Armoricain and is drained southward by the Mayenne River and its tributaries. Livestock (cattle and pigs) are raised in the upland regions, while grains (wheat and corn [maize]) and forage crops are grown in the lowlands adjoining the Paris Basin. Maine is predominantly Roman Catholic, and most modern parishes date from the 13th century.
