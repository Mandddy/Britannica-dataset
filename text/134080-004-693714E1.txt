Tourmaline, borosilicate mineral of complex and variable composition. Three types of tourmaline, distinguished by the predominance of certain elements, are usually recognized: iron tourmaline (schorl), black in colour; magnesium tourmaline (dravite), brown; and alkali tourmaline, which may be pink (rubellite), green (Brazilian emerald), or colourless (achroite). Some crystals are pink at one end and green at the other; concentric colour zoning may also occur. The coloured varieties, when transparent and free from flaws, are cut as gems.
Tourmaline is very abundant and has the best-developed crystals in pegmatites and in metamorphosed limestones in contact with granitic magmas. Because tourmaline is resistant to weathering, it accumulates in detrital deposits and is a common accessory mineral in sedimentary rocks. Gem-quality pegmatites are found in the United States (southern California and Maine), Brazil, and Madagascar.
