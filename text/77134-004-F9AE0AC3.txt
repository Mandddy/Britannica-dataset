Norma Shearer, in full Edith Norma Shearer  (born August 1902, Montreal, Quebec, Canada—died June 12, 1983, Woodland Hills, California, U.S.) American motion-picture actress known for her glamour, charm, sophistication, and versatility. Shearer was dubbed the “First Lady of the Screen” by MGM because of her marriage to Hollywood producer Irving G. Thalberg.
Shearer, who had been a child model, won a beauty contest at age 14. After her once-wealthy family lost everything during World War I, Shearer’s ambitious mother took Norma and her sister to New York City, hoping that success in show business would restore the family fortunes. Despite failing an audition for Florenz Ziegfeld’s Follies—Ziegfeld said she was too short and had fat legs and a cast in one eye—Shearer worked as a model and landed a few small roles in New York-based movies. She was an extra in The Flapper and D.W. Griffith’s Way Down East in 1920, although Griffith, like Ziegfeld, saw no future for her as an actress. That same year, Shearer landed her first feature role in The Stealers, which caught the attention of talent scout and future MGM vice president Irving Thalberg, who secured a five-year contract for Shearer with the studio in 1923. Shearer and Thalberg were married in 1927, after which Shearer had her pick of films, parts, costars, and directors, and she used this advantage to avoid being typecast. Like her husband, Shearer understood the importance of packaging and publicity and demanded perfection in every detail of her costumes, makeup, and scenes.
