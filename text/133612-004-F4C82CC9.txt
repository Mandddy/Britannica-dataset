Sir Paul Gavrilovitch Vinogradoff, Russian Pavel Gavrilovich Vinogradov   (born Nov. 18 [Nov. 30, New Style], 1854, Kostroma, near Moscow, Russia—died  Dec. 19, 1925, Paris, France) Anglo-Russian legal scholar and medievalist who was perhaps the greatest authority in his time on the feudal laws and customs of England.
Educated at the University of Moscow (Ph.D., 1884), Vinogradoff was appointed professor there and became active in Russian educational reform. When university authorities curtailed the students’ freedom of expression, he resigned his professorship (1902) and left Russia for England, where in 1903 he became professor of jurisprudence at Oxford. He was knighted in 1917, one year before he became a British subject.
