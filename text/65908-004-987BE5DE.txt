Jacqueline Cochran, married name Jacqueline Cochran Odlum, also called Jackie Cochran, original name Bessie Lee Pittman  (born May 11, 1906, Muscogee, Florida, U.S.—died August 9, 1980, Indio, California) American pilot who held more speed, distance, and altitude records than any other flyer during her career. In 1964 she flew an aircraft faster than any woman had before.
Pittman grew up in poverty and had little formal education. (She later claimed to have been an orphan in a foster home, but she actually lived with her family.) At age eight her family moved to Georgia, where she went to work in a cotton mill. When she was 14, she married Robert Cochran, and they had a son, Robert, Jr., in 1921. Robert, Jr., died in 1925, and the couple divorced in 1927. Cochran had trained as a beautician and pursued that career in Montgomery, Alabama, in Pensacola, Florida, and from roughly 1931 in New York City, where she took the name Jacqueline. She took her first flying lessons in 1932 and got her pilot’s license in three weeks. She soon mastered the technical aspects of aviation and navigation, later studying privately with a navy pilot friend in San Diego, California. Meanwhile, in 1935 she organized a cosmetics firm, Jacqueline Cochran Cosmetics, which grew and prospered under her management until she sold it in 1963.
