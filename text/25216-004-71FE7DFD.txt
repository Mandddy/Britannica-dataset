Joseph Rucker Lamar,  (born October 14, 1857, Elbert county, Georgia, U.S.—died January 2, 1916, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1911–16).
In 1877 Lamar earned a bachelor’s degree from Bethany College in West Virginia. After studying law briefly at Washington and Lee University, he left there without earning a degree. Lamar was admitted to the Georgia bar in 1878, after which he taught Latin for a year at Bethany College and married the daughter of the college president. In 1880 he was offered a law partnership and started his practice in Augusta, Georgia. He rose rapidly in the legal profession; he also served two terms in the state legislature and wrote on the history of Georgia jurisprudence. In 1893 Lamar was appointed one of three commissioners to recodify Georgia’s laws. The compilation, The Code of the State of Georgia (1896), was well received and contributed to his later appointment to the state Supreme Court in 1904. He served briefly, stepping down owing to ill health, but in 1911 he was appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States by President William Howard Taft.
