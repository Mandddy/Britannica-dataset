Tasmanian Wilderness, area of remarkable natural beauty and ecological diversity in southwestern, western, and central Tasmania, Australia. Designated a World Heritage site in 1982, its area was extended to some 5,300 square miles (13,800 square km) in 1989.
The Tasmanian Wilderness consists largely of Southwest National Park (established 1968), Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park (1981), and Cradle Mountainâ€“Lake St. Clair National Park (1971), but it also includes the national parks Walls of Jerusalem (1981) and Hartz Mountains (1939). On its northeastern and eastern edges are the Central Plateau Conservation Area (1982) and other protected lands. Archaeological sites within the region are Maxwell River and Wargata Mina, and there is a historic site at Macquarie Harbour.
