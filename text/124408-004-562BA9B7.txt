El Cid, English The Cid, also called El Campeador (“the Champion”), byname of Rodrigo, or Ruy, Díaz de Vivar  (born c. 1043, Vivar, near Burgos, Castile [Spain]—died July 10, 1099, Valencia) Castilian military leader and national hero. His popular name, El Cid (from Spanish Arabic al-sīd, “lord”), dates from his lifetime.
Rodrigo Díaz’s father, Diego Laínez, was a member of the minor nobility (infanzones) of Castile. But the Cid’s social background was less unprivileged than later popular tradition liked to suppose, for he was directly connected on his mother’s side to the great landed aristocracy, and he was brought up at the court of Ferdinand I in the household of that king’s eldest son, the future Sancho II of Castile. When Sancho succeeded to the Castilian throne (1065), he nominated the 22-year-old Cid as his standard-bearer (armiger regis), or commander of the royal troops. This early promotion to important office suggests that the young Cid had already won a reputation for military prowess. In 1067 he accompanied Sancho on a campaign against the important Moorish kingdom of Zaragoza (Saragossa) and played a leading role in the negotiations that made its king, al-Muqtadir, a tributary of the Castilian crown.
