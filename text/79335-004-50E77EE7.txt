Cyrus Edwin Dallin,  (born Nov. 22, 1861, Springville, Utah, U.S.—died  Nov. 14, 1944, Boston, Mass.) American sculptor, best known for equestrian portraits of American Indians.
Dallin studied in Boston and in Paris and then returned to Boston to teach sculpture at the Massachusetts School of Art. As a boy Dallin had lived among Indians, and his portrayals of them were in a naturalistic mode, devoid of the melodrama often associated with this subject by some of his contemporaries. Among Dallin’s most notable works are “The Signal of Peace” (1890; Lincoln Park, Chicago), “The Medicine Man” (1899; Fairmount Park, Philadelphia), and “Sir Isaac Newton” (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
