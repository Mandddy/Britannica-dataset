Herbert Putnam,  (born Sept. 20, 1861, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Aug. 14, 1955, Woods Hole, Mass.) American librarian who built the Library of Congress into a world-renowned institution.
Putnam graduated from Harvard in 1883 and thereafter studied law at Columbia University, being admitted to the bar in 1886. His true calling was as a librarian, however. He served as librarian of the Minneapolis Athenaeum in 1884–87 and of the Minneapolis Public Library in 1887–91. After a few years practicing law in Boston (1892–95), he served as librarian of the Boston Public Library from 1895 to 1899. In the latter year he was appointed librarian of the Library of Congress, and he retained this position until 1939.
