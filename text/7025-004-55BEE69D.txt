Button quail, also called Bustard Quail,  any of numerous small, round-bodied birds belonging to the family Turnicidae of the order Gruiformes. The 15 species are confined to scrubby grasslands in warm regions of the Old World. Button quail are dull-coloured birds, 13 to 19 centimetres (5 to 7 inches) long, that run crouching and zigzagging through the grass but are capable of weak whirring flight on their short rounded wings. Button quail usually go about singly or in pairs; they may join flocks of true quails.
Females, larger and more strongly patterned than males, do the courting and nest building. Males are much less vocal. They incubate the eggs and care for the young. The females mate with several different males in a single season, running off as soon as the eggs are laid. The incubation period, 12 or 13 days, is the shortest known for any precocial bird. The young are independent within two weeks, undergo two rapid molts, are full sized in six or seven weeks, and may breed when less than three months old.
