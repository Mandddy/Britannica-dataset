File snake,  (Mehelya), any of about 10 species of African snakes belonging to the family Colubridae. They are named for their triangular body cross section and rough-keeled (ridged) scales. Most are less than 1 metre (about 3 feet) in length and are plainly coloured. They are active by night on the ground. File snakes are nonvenomous; they prey on frogs, lizards, and other snakes, including venomous ones. Often exceeding 1.5 metres in total length, the Cape file snake (M. capensis) of central Africa is one of the largest species. It preys regularly on snakes, including cobras and puff adders. All members of Mehelya are egg-layers and deposit small clutches of large eggs.
