Ovenbird, any of over 200 species of small birds, named for building a domed nest with a side entrance, especially Seiurus aurocapillus, a wood warbler (family Parulidae, order Passeriformes) of North America east of the Rockies; it winters south to Colombia. Brownish olive above, with a streaked breast, white eye ring, and black-edged orange crown, the bird looks like a small thrush. Its song, “tee-cher,” is repeated with increasing intensity in dank woods. The ovenbird walks, unlike most other wood warblers, which hop. Its nest is a dome of grass placed on the ground.
The term ovenbird is also used broadly for members of the tropical American family Furnariidae and especially for members of the genus Furnarius (also known by the Spanish name hornero, meaning “baker”). They are 15–20 cm (6–8 inches) long, reddish brown, and thrushlike, common in open country throughout most of South America. On a branch, post, or roof ledge, the hornero builds an ovenlike nest of mud and grass, about 30 cm high, with an enclosed nest chamber.
