Campbell Soup Company, American manufacturer, incorporated in 1922 but dating to a canning firm first established in 1869, that is the world’s largest producer of soup. It is also a major producer of canned pasta products; snack foods, such as cookies and crackers; fruit and tomato juices; canned sauces; and chocolates. The company’s products are sold in 120 countries around the world. Headquarters are in Camden, N.J.
In 1869 Joseph Campbell (died 1900), a fruit merchant, and Abram Anderson, an icebox manufacturer, formed a partnership in Camden to can tomatoes, vegetables, preserves, and other products. In 1876 Anderson left the partnership, and Campbell joined with Arthur Dorrance to form a new firm, which in 1891 was named the Jos. Campbell Preserve Company (incorporated 1901). In 1894 Campbell retired, and three years later Dorrance’s nephew, J.T. Dorrance (1873–1930), joined the company and introduced the idea of condensed soups. The soups with the familiar red-and-white label appeared in 1898 and, after winning the Gold Medallion at the Paris Exposition in 1900, were labeled with that medallion thereafter.
