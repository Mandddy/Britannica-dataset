Xi’an, Wade-Giles romanization Hsi-an, also spelled Xian, conventional Sian, historically Chang’an,  city and capital of Shaanxi sheng (province), north-central China. It is located in the south-central part of the province, at the southern limit of the Loess Plateau. The city site is on a low plain on the south bank of the Wei River. Just to the south the Qin (Tsingling) Mountains rise dramatically above the plain. The Xi’an region is one of the most important in the history of China, both as the capital of several ruling dynasties and as a market and trade centre. Xi’an was the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, the ancient trade route that connected China with the Mediterranean. Pop. (2006 est.) city, 3,094,267; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 4,009,000.
Cities have existed in the area since the 11th century bce. Chang’an Cheng (“Walled City of Chang’an”), built in 202 bce just northwest of present-day Xi’an, was the capital of the Xi (Western) Han dynasty (206 bce–25 ce) and was one of the greatest cities of the ancient world. It was largely destroyed during the disturbances that preceded the Xin interregnum of the Han (9–25 ce) perpetrated by Wang Man. The Dong (Eastern) Han dynasty, established in 25, moved its capital east to Luoyang (now in Henan province).
