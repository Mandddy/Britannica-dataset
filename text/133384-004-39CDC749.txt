Oxfordshire, administrative and historic county of south-central England. It is bounded to the north by Warwickshire and Northamptonshire, to the west by Gloucestershire, to the south by Berkshire, and to the east by Buckinghamshire. Wiltshire lies to the southwest of the administrative county, which covers a larger area than the historic county. Oxford, home of the famed University of Oxford, is the county seat.
The administrative county comprises five districts: Cherwell, the city of Oxford, South Oxfordshire, Vale of White Horse, and West Oxfordshire. The Vale of White Horse district and the part of South Oxfordshire to the west of the River Thames lie outside the historic county of Oxfordshire. Those areas belong to the historic county of Berkshire.
