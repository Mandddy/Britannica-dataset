Epilobium,  genus of about 200 plants, in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae), native to most temperate regions. It includes fireweed (species E. angustifolium), which rapidly covers newly burned areas. The young parts of some species can be cooked and eaten as potherbs. The plants are sometimes cultivated but must be carefully confined.
The hairy willow herb, or codling-and-cream (E. hirsutum), up to 2 m (6 feet) high, is similar to fireweed but has hairy leaves and stalks and notched flower petals; it is found in waste places in eastern North America. Rock fringe (E. obcordatum) is a prostrate form from the western United States; it has rose-purple flowers. Two alpine species are E. alsinifolium and E. fleischeri, with almost needlelike leaves and purplish red or rose-red flower spikes. E. nummularifolium, from New Zealand, has whitish flowers and brownish red leaves; it is grown in rock gardens for its attractive matlike growth. E. montanum, with pale pink flowers, is found in temperate-zone woods.
