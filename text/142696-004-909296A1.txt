Westmeath, Irish An Iarmhí,  county in the province of Leinster, central Ireland. It is bounded by Counties Cavan (north), Meath (east), Offaly (south), Roscommon (west), and Longford (northwest). Mullingar, in central Westmeath, is the county town (seat).
The western boundary of Westmeath is the lower part of Lough (Lake) Ree and the River Shannon, but elsewhere the county’s limits wind through the central lowland, except at Lough Sheelin in the north. The county’s terrain is largely undulating and about 200–400 feet (60–120 metres) above sea level. In the south there are numerous long, narrow glacial ridges called eskers.
