Vaslav Nijinsky, Russian in full Vatslav Fomich Nizhinsky   (born March 12 [Feb. 28, old style], 1890, Kiev—died  April 8, 1950, London) Russian-born ballet dancer of almost legendary fame, celebrated for his spectacular leaps and sensitive interpretations. After a brilliant school career, Nijinsky became a soloist at the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, in 1907, appearing in such classical ballets as Giselle, Swan Lake, and The Sleeping Beauty. In 1909 he joined Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, and the company’s choreographer Michel Fokine created Le Spectre de la rose, Petrushka, Schéhérazade, and other ballets expressly for him. Nijinsky’s own works as a choreographer include L’Après-midi d’un faune and Le Sacre du printemps.
Vaslav was the second son of Thomas Laurentiyevich Nijinsky and Eleonora Bereda; both his parents were celebrated dancers, and his father in particular was famous for his virtuosity and enormous leaps. The Nijinskys had their own dance company and performed throughout the Russian Empire. Nijinsky’s childhood was mostly spent in the Caucasus, where he danced as a small child with his brother Stanislav and his little sister Bronisława. His father, noticing the child’s great disposition for dancing, gave him his first lessons.
