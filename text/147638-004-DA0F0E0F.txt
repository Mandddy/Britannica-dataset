Arthur William Upfield,  (born Sept. 1, 1888, Gosport, Hampshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 13, 1964, Bowral, N.S.W., Australia) English-born Australian popular novelist who wrote more than 30 novels featuring Detective Inspector Napoleon (Boney) Bonaparte, a half-Aboriginal Australian detective.
Upfield emigrated to Australia in 1911 and was a sheepherder, gold miner, cowhand, soldier, and fur trapper before turning to writing. While working in the Australian wilderness Upfield met a half-Aboriginal who became the prototype of his detective hero. His novels, all interspersed with lengthy descriptions of the colourful Australian landscape, include The Barrakee Mystery (1929), in which Bonaparte first appeared; Murder Down Under (1943); and The Body at Madman’s Bend (1963). Upfield also wrote serious newspaper and magazine articles on Australian topography and history, as well as short stories.
