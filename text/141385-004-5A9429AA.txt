Adour River,  river in southwestern France. The Adour River rises in the central Pyrenees near Tourmalet Pass, just south of Midi de Bigorre Peak, and flows in a curve, north, then west, to enter the Bay of Biscay just below Bayonne after a course of 208 miles (335 km). Draining a basin of 5,800 square miles (15,000 square km), it traverses the scenic Campan Valley and, after passing Bagnères-de-Bigorre, crosses the Tarbes plain. Beyond Tarbes the river feeds many irrigation canals, the most important of which is the Canal d’Alaric, which follows the right bank. Within Landes département the Adour flows west and southwest and is joined on the left by the Larcis, Gabas, Louts, Luy, and Gave de Pau and on the right by the Midouze. The Adour, which is navigable upstream to Dax, enters the bay through an estuary made hazardous by a shifting sandbar.
