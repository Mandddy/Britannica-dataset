Cloud rat, also called cloudrunner,  any of six species of slow-moving, nocturnal, tree-dwelling rodents found only in Philippine forests. Giant cloud rats belong to the genus Phloeomys (two species), whereas bushy-tailed cloud rats are classified in the genus Crateromys (four species).
Also called slender-tailed cloud rats, both species of Phloeomys live on the island of Luzon and weigh from 1.5 to more than 2 kg (3.3 to 4.4 pounds). Their bodies range in length from 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 inches), not including a furred tail that is about as long as the body. Phloeomys pallidus, found in northern Luzon, has long, dense, soft fur of cream or pale gray interrupted by black or brown markings. It is easily distinguished from P. cumingi, which has short, dark brown fur. P. cumingi lives in southern Luzon and on the offshore island of Catanduanes. Both species are found from lowlands to mountains, where they nest in hollow trees and feed on tender young leaves. One young per year is usual.
