Rouen, port city and capital of Seine-Maritime département, Haute-Normandie région, northwestern France. It is located about 78 miles (125 km) northwest of Paris, on the Seine River.
Known to the Romans as Rotomagus, the city first became important in the 3rd century ce, when Christianity was introduced there by St. Mellon, who was its first bishop. Invaded by the Normans in 876, it became subject to the English crown after the Norman Conquest of England (1066). In 1204 the French captured Rouen, and the city prospered until the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453), when, in 1419, it was taken by Henry V of England. In 1430 St. Joan of Arc, the patron saint of France, was imprisoned at Rouen in a tower that still stands and now bears her name. Tried and condemned for heresy, she was burned at the stake by the English in the city on the Place du Vieux-Marché in May 1431. The city was recaptured by the French in 1449 and for the following century it was one of the main cultural centres of France. It suffered during the Wars of Religion (late 16th century), and more than half its population emigrated after 1685, when the revocation of the Edict of Nantes deprived French Protestants of their civil and religious liberties. The port and city then declined until the 19th century, when the textile trade brought it new prosperity. Rouen was occupied by the Germans during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War.
