Glass frog (family Centrolenidae), any of a group of tree frogs found in the New World tropics, some species of which have transparent bellies and chests. In glass frogs the viscera are visible, and an observer can see the heart pumping blood into the arteries and food moving through the gut. There is no satisfactory explanation for this transparency, and not all species have a “glass” underside. Viewed from above, most glass frogs appear light green. Their patterning ranges from uniform green to green with white to yellow spots that mimic glass frog eggs. Glass frogs have expanded digit tips that aid in climbing, and this trait allows most to live in trees or shrubs along forest streams.
Glass frogs include more than 120 species in three genera (Centrolene, Cochranella, and Hyalinobatrachium). They occur from tropical lowland forests to mid-elevation mountain forests. Most species are small, with adults ranging from 20 to 30 mm (0.8 to1.2 inches) in total length. In a few species adults are larger, attaining a maximum length of nearly 80 mm (3 inches).
