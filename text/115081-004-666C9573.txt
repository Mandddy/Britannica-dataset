Mel Brooks, original name Melvin Kaminsky  (born June 28, 1926, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American film and television director, producer, writer, and actor whose motion pictures elevated outrageousness and vulgarity to high comic art.
Brooks was an accomplished mimic, pianist, and drummer by the time he graduated from high school and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1944. As part of his assignment to the Army Specialized Training Program, he received instruction at the Virginia Military Institute. After serving as a combat engineer in Europe during World War II, he became a professional entertainer, working as a stand-up comic, an emcee, and a social director at resorts in the Catskill Mountains (the so-called Borscht Belt). In 1949 he joined the writing staff for The Admiral Broadway Revue, a weekly television series starring Sid Caesar. Brooks remained with Caesar until 1958, contributing material to the comedian’s subsequent TV efforts, most memorably to the landmark comedy series Your Show of Shows (1950–54) as part of a writing staff that included Carl Reiner, Neil Simon, and Larry Gelbart. Additionally, Brooks collaborated on the librettos for the musicals Shinbone Alley (1957) and All American (1962).
