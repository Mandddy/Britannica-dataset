The Lady from Shanghai, American film noir, released in 1947, that was adapted from the Sherwood King novel If I Die Before I Wake. Director, writer, and star Orson Welles cast his estranged wife, Rita Hayworth, opposite himself in a film that became famous for its confounding plot and for the studio interference that marred Welles’s vision for the project.
Welles appeared in the offbeat role of Michael O’Hara, a naive man who is snared into taking a bizarre sea journey with an aging millionaire (played by Everett Sloane) and his young, sexually frustrated wife (Hayworth). This leads to O’Hara’s implication in a murder and to the bizarre trial sequence that follows. The film culminates in a legendary shootout amid a fun-house hall of mirrors.
