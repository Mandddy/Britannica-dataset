Urban IV, original name Jacques Pantaléon   (born c. 1200, Troyes, Champagne [France]—died October 2, 1264, Perugia, Papal States [Italy]) pope from 1261 to 1264.
Urban was of humble origin. He was first a priest at Lyon and then professor of canon law at Paris before being elevated to the bishopric of Verdun in 1253. Two years later he was made patriarch of Jerusalem by Pope Alexander IV. Despite not having been made a cardinal, he succeeded Alexander as pope on August 29, 1261. Urban was faced with three tasks: freeing the Kingdom of Sicily, a papal fief, from domination by the Hohenstaufen dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire; reasserting papal influence in Italy, where it had diminished because of Alexander’s vacillation on the Sicilian problem; and restoring order in Rome, which suffered such civil unrest that Urban never resided there as pope.
