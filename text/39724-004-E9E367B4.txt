Karl Weierstrass, in full Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass  (born Oct. 31, 1815, Ostenfelde, Bavaria [Germany]—died Feb. 19, 1897, Berlin) German mathematician, one of the founders of the modern theory of functions.
His domineering father sent him to the University of Bonn at age 19 to study law and finance in preparation for a position in the Prussian civil service. Weierstrass pursued four years of intensive fencing and drinking and returned home with no degree. He then entered the Academy of Münster in 1839 to prepare for a career as a secondary school teacher. At Münster he came under the influence of Cristof Gudermann, professor of mathematics, who was particularly interested in the theory of elliptic functions. Gudermann cultivated Weierstrass’s interest in the theory of functions with emphasis on the expansion of functions by power series.
