Benny Goodman, in full Benjamin David Goodman   (born May 30, 1909, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died June 13, 1986, New York, New York) American jazz musician and bandleader and a renowned 20th-century clarinet virtuoso. Dubbed the “King of Swing,” Goodman was also a complex personality whose relentless pursuit of perfection was reflected in his approach to music.
The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Goodman received his first musical training in 1919 at a Chicago synagogue, and he soon began playing in bands and studying music at Jane Addams’s Hull House. From two years of study with the classical instructor Franz Schoepp, Goodman acquired the work habits and purity of tone that allowed him to perform adroitly in both the classical and jazz fields. Goodman also absorbed the basics of jazz in his early teenage years via jam sessions with Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Frank Teschemacher, and through listening to musicians such as Jimmie Noone and Johnny Dodds. By age 14, Goodman was astounding seasoned musicians with his attack, intonation, and fluent improvisation.
