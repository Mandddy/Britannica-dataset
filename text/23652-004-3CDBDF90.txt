Mary Noailles Murfree, pseudonym Charles Egbert Craddock   (born Jan. 24, 1850, near Murfreesboro, Tenn., U.S.—died  July 31, 1922, Murfreesboro) American writer in the local-colour movement, most of whose stories present the narrow, stern life of the Tennessee mountaineers who were left behind in the advance of civilization.
Mary Murfree studied at Chegaray Institute, a French school in Philadelphia, in 1867–69. With the failure of her father’s business in 1869 the family returned to their native Murfreesboro, Tennessee (which was named in 1811 for her great-grandfather). There Murfree began writing stories for her own and her family’s entertainment. In 1874 one of her stories appeared in Lippincott’s Magazine under the name “R. Emmet Dembry,” and her writing career was begun. A story in The Atlantic Monthly in 1878 appeared under the name “Charles Egbert Craddock,” which she used thereafter.
