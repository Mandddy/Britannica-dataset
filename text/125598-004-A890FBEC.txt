Noodle,  a cooked egg-and-flour paste prominent in European and Asian cuisine, generally distinguished from pasta by its elongated, ribbonlike form. Noodles are commonly used to add body and flavour to broth soups. They are commonly boiled or saut√©ed and served with sauces and meats or baked in casseroles.
Asian noodles are made primarily from starch ingredients other than flour, although the recipes for some Asian pan-fried and stir-fried dishes allow the substitution of wheat-flour noodles for the Chinese mein. Noodles made from rice flour or the starch of the mung bean are softened in water and then boiled and drained in preparation for being fried or added to soups.
