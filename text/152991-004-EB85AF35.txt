Lee Marvin,  (born February 19, 1924, New York, New York, U.S.—died August 29, 1987, Tucson, Arizona) rugged, durable American actor who was perhaps the quintessential cinematic “tough guy.”
Marvin took up acting after a stint in marine service during World War II and appeared in Broadway and Off-Broadway shows until his film debut in 1951. For the better part of 14 years, he appeared in smaller roles; his tall, lean, brutal, stone-faced appearance made him an excellent choice for the role of villain in Hollywood action films and westerns. Many of Marvin’s early films are notable works of major directors, such as Fritz Lang’s The Big Heat (1953), László Benedek’s The Wild One (1954), John Sturges’s Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), and Robert Aldrich’s Attack! (1956).
