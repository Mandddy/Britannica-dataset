The Adventures of Robin Hood, American romantic adventure film, released in 1938, that is considered one of the great cinematic adventures and starred Errol Flynn in what became the defining role of his career.
The film tells the tale of Robin Hood, with Flynn as the legendary bandit trying to aid the king of England, Richard the Lion-Heart (played by Ian Hunter), who has been captured on his return from the Crusades. After accusing Richard’s devious brother Prince John (Claude Rains) of plotting to usurp the throne, Robin decamps to Sherwood Forest, where he assembles a band of men to defy John’s excessive taxes on the poor by stealing from the rich and redistributing the wealth. Intercepting John’s associates Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone) and the Sheriff of Nottingham (Melville Cooper) in the forest, Robin seizes a collection of tax money and warns their companion, Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland), of their wicked intentions. The sheriff subsequently holds an archery tournament to lure Robin out of the forest; when Robin wins, he is arrested and sentenced to death. Although Marian quickly alerts Robin’s men, who are able to save him from execution, she is imprisoned when her allegiance to Robin is discovered. Meanwhile, Richard returns to England, his ransom having been paid, and helps Robin and his men thwart John’s attempted coronation. John is thereafter banished, and plans are made for Robin and Marian to marry.
