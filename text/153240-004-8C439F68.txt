German E. coli outbreak of 2011, also called E. coli O104:H4 outbreak of 2011, German Escherichia coli outbreak of 2011, or German E. coli O104:H4 outbreak of 2011,  bacterial disease outbreak that began in Germany in late April 2011 and that was caused by a previously rare strain of E. coli (Escherichia coli) known as O104:H4.
The 2011 E. coli outbreak was the deadliest and the second largest on record—the largest was the Japan E. coli outbreak of 1996, in which more than 12,600 people became infected—and was responsible for a total of 4,321 cases and 50 deaths, most of which occurred in Germany. About 900 cases involved hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), in which infection of the gastrointestinal tract by toxin-producing bacteria results in the destruction of red blood cells. Kidney failure, a frequent complication of HUS, was the primary cause of death during the outbreak.
