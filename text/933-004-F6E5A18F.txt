Negro league, any of the associations of African American baseball teams active largely between 1920 and the late 1940s, when black players were at last contracted to play major and minor league baseball. The principal Negro leagues were the Negro National League (1920–31, 1933–48), the Eastern Colored League (1923–28), and the Negro American League (1937–60). A "gentleman’s agreement" among the leaders of what was then called “Organized Baseball” (the major and minor leagues) erected a colour bar against black players from the last years of the 19th century until 1946, although these leaders rarely admitted its existence.
There were two attempts to establish leagues for black teams in the early years of the 20th century. The first was in 1906 when the International League of Independent Base Ball Clubs was formed in the Philadelphia area. It had two white teams and four black. The championship game pitted two black teams against each other and attracted 10,000 fans to the stadium of the Philadelphia (now Oakland) Athletics. (This was the first time black clubs performed in a major league park, though later most of the top black clubs played in stadiums of major league or top minor league teams.) The league folded after its first season.
