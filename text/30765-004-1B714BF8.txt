Tester, canopy, usually of carved or cloth-draped wood, over a bed, tomb, pulpit, or throne. It dates from the 14th century and is usually made of the same material as the object it covers. It can be supported either by four posts, by two posts at the foot and a headpiece at the back, or by suspension from the ceiling. The edges may overhang and in some cases are decorated with incised work or a fabric valance. The word, derived from the late Latin testa (“head”), came into use in the Middle Ages, originally referring only to the vertical headpiece.
Perhaps the most notable and widespread use of the tester was in bed design. Sixteenth- and 17th-century testers were frequently massive in construction and featured elaborate carving of the canopy over the bed and of its supporting posts. In the 18th century, testers over beds became lighter and more purely decorative, in part because of the development of smaller, more intimate rooms in northern European residences. Popular in 19th-century England, the characteristic full tester bed featured detailed front posts on a vase-turned section resting on block supports. Also popular in America at the beginning of the 19th century was the closely related field bed, with an arched tester over a light, plain framework. A half tester is supported only at the head of the bed.
