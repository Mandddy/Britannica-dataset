Federal Constitutional Court, German Bundesverfassungsgericht,  in Germany, special court for the review of judicial and administrative decisions and legislation to determine whether they are in accord with the Basic Law (constitution) of the country. Although all German courts are empowered to review the constitutionality of governmental action within their jurisdiction, the Federal Constitutional Court is the only court that may declare statutes unconstitutional under the Basic Law; the Länder (states) have their own constitutional courts. The Federal Constitutional Court was enshrined in the German constitution adopted after World War II and reflects lessons learned from the Nazi era (1933–45), when the power of the federal government was unchecked. Although there was some limited precedent for judicial review in German constitutional history, the far-reaching jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court was influenced primarily by the model of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Austrian Constitutional Court. The court, which began sittings in 1951, is headquartered in Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg.
The Federal Constitutional Court has two separate panels (senates) of 8 judges each (originally 12), and each panel has jurisdiction over distinct areas of constitutional law. Judges serve a single, nonrenewable 12-year term (service, however, may not extend past the retirement age of 68). Half the membership is elected by the Bundesrat (the upper house of the German legislature), the other half by a special committee of the Bundestag (the lower house). To be elected, a judge must secure a two-thirds majority of votes cast; this rule has generally prevented any party or coalition from determining the court’s composition.
