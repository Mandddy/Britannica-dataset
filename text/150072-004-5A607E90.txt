Tablas de Daimiel National Park, nature reserve and wetland ecosystem, located about 19 miles (30 km) northeast of the city of Ciudad Real, south-central Spain. The park, created in 1973, occupies 4,633 acres (1,875 hectares) and lies at the confluence of the Guadiana and Cigüela rivers, where fresh and brackish waters converge on the marshes and support both migratory and resident waterfowl year-round. The rivers’ water levels have varied as some of the water has been transferred for irrigation.
