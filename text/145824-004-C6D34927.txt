National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, also called Pretoria Zoo,  zoo near Pretoria, S.Af., that is noted for its wildlife conservation programs. It was opened in 1899 by the State Museum of the South African Republic on a small stretch of land along the Apies River, which flows through Pretoria. In 1913 the zoo became the Transvaal Zoological Gardens, independent of the state museum; in 1916 it adopted its present name, and in 1933 the state took over management of the institution. Over the years the zoo gradually expanded, and it now occupies both sides of the Apies River, covering a total area of about 32 hectares (80 acres). The zooâ€™s collection of antelope is one of the largest in the world. On the 4,047-hectare (10,000-acre) game-breeding centre, opened in 1974 near Lichtenburg, the zoo has successfully bred the endangered scimitar-horned oryx and the banteng. It also operates a 40.5-hectare (100-acre) cheetah-breeding area called De Wildt. The Pretoria Zoo was the first to breed the aardwolf, a member of the hyena family.
