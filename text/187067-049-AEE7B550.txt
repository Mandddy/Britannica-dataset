Fuller’s earth, any fine-grained, naturally occurring earthy substance that has a substantial ability to adsorb impurities or colouring bodies from fats, grease, or oils. Its name originated with the textile industry, in which textile workers (or fullers) cleaned raw wool by kneading it in a mixture of water and fine earth that adsorbed oil, dirt, and other contaminants from the fibres.
Fuller’s earth consists chiefly of hydrated aluminum silicates that contain metal ions such as magnesium, sodium, and calcium within their structure. Montmorillonite is the principal clay mineral in fuller’s earth, but other minerals such as kaolinite, attapulgite, and palygorskite also occur and account for its variable chemical composition. Though similar in appearance to clay, fuller’s earth differs by being more fine-grained and by having a higher water content. It also crumbles into mud when mixed with water, so it has little natural plasticity. The substance is found in a wide range of natural colours, from brown or green to yellow and white.
