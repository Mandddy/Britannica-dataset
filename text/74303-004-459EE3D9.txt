Philosophy of physics, philosophical speculation about the concepts, methods, and theories of the physical sciences, especially physics.
The philosophy of physics is less an academic discipline—though it is that—than an intellectual frontier across which theoretical physics and modern Western philosophy have been informing and unsettling each other for more than 400 years. Many of the deepest intellectual commitments of Western culture—regarding the character of matter, the nature of space and time, the question of determinism, the meaning of probability and chance, the possibility of knowledge, and much else besides—have been vividly challenged since the inception of modern science, beginning with the work of Galileo (1564–1642). By the time of Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727), a lively conversation between physics and a distinctly modern Western philosophical tradition was well under way, an exchange that has flourished to the present day. That conversation is the topic of this article.
