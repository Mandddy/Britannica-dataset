William Ames,  (born 1576, Ipswich, Suffolk, Eng.—died  Nov. 14, 1633, Rotterdam) English Puritan theologian remembered for his writings on ethics and for debating and writing in favour of strict Calvinism in opposition to Arminianism.
As a student at Cambridge, Ames viewed cardplaying as an offense to Christian living—no less serious than profanity. In 1609 his dispute with the Church of England’s customs of conduct came to a head in his sermon attacking what he saw as the debauchery attending the feast of St. Thomas. Obliged to leave England, he sailed in 1610 to Rotterdam. There, in the fisherman’s habit donned for the passage, he debated Nicolaas Grevinckhoven (Grevinchovius), minister to the local Arminian Church, on the doctrines of atonement and predestination. The Calvinists emphasized that salvation is limited to those who are foreordained by God to receive it and are not capable of falling out of his grace. The Arminians, on the other hand, believed that all men are capable of receiving God’s grace if they are believers and if they fulfill certain other conditions.
