Jerry Springer, byname of Gerald Norman Springer   (born February 13, 1944, London, England) British-born American television host, best known for The Jerry Springer Show (1991– ), a daytime talk show featuring controversial topics and outrageous guest behaviour.
Springer’s family immigrated to the United States when he was five years old, taking up residence in New York City. In 1965 he graduated from Tulane University with a political science degree, and three years later he earned a law degree from the Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago. Following graduation, he worked on the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy. In the early 1970s Springer embarked on his own political career in Ohio, serving on Cincinnati’s city council. In 1974 he was forced to resign from the council over a controversy involving prostitution, but he regained his seat at the next election. Although a liberal in relatively conservative Cincinnati, he was elected mayor of the city in 1977 (served 1977–78). In 1982 he made a failed bid for the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio. Afterward he turned to television journalism. However, Springer remained interested in politics, regularly appearing on television programs to espouse his liberal philosophy. He also considered a return to the political arena in 2004 to run for the U.S. Senate.
