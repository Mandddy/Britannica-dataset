Keri Hulme,  Keri originally spelled Kerry   (born March 9, 1947, Christchurch, N.Z.) New Zealand novelist, poet, and short-story writer, chiefly known for her first novel, The Bone People (1983), which won the Booker Prize in 1985.
Much of Hulme’s writing deals with the language and culture of the Maori people of New Zealand. Although Hulme was born of mostly mixed Orkney and English descent, she identified closely with the Kai Tahu tribe of the Maori, of which she claimed one-eighth ancestry. She attended Canterbury University, Christchurch, and worked at a variety of jobs, including writer-in-residence at Otago University, Dunedin, in 1978. Her first book, The Silences Between: Moeraki Conversations (1982), is a verse collection noted for its unique and varied use of language. The Bone People, Hulme’s most acclaimed work, features three characters she first created as an 18-year-old: Kerewin Holmes, a reclusive painter based on the author herself; Simon, a young mute boy who is washed ashore after a shipwreck; and Joe Gillayley, a Maori factory worker. The book is praised for its Maori mysticism and lyrical originality. Hulme also published Te Kaihau/The Windeater (1986), a collection of short stories, and the collections of poetry Lost Possessions (1985) and Strands (1992). Stonefish (2004) is a collection of short stories.
