Vince Lombardi, byname of Vincent Thomas Lombardi  (born June 11, 1913, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died Sept. 3, 1970, Washington, D.C.) coach in American professional gridiron football who became a national symbol of single-minded determination to win. In nine seasons (1959–67) as head coach of the previously moribund Green Bay Packers, he led the team to five championships of the National Football League (NFL) and, in the last two seasons, to victory in the first two Super Bowl games against the American Football League titleholder.
At Fordham University, Lombardi was outstanding in the classroom as well as on the football field, where he was one of the group of linemen known as the “Seven Blocks of Granite.” After completing his undergraduate education in business (1937), he studied law at Fordham, briefly played semiprofessional football, and then entered high-school football coaching (1939). Afterward he served as an assistant coach at Fordham (1947–48), at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York (1949–53), and with the New York Giants of the NFL (1954–58). Hired as head coach and general manager of the Packers in February 1959, Lombardi imposed an unusually strenuous regimen (some critics described it as spartan or fanatic) on his players, most of whom had been accustomed to defeat. The players who survived his relentless driving and gained his respect became deeply loyal to him. In his second year, Green Bay led the Western Conference of the NFL. The Packers subsequently won the league championship in 1961–62 and 1965–67 and defeated the Kansas City Chiefs and then the Oakland Raiders in the Super Bowl games in 1967 and 1968. Unlike his chief rival, Tom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys, Lombardi excelled as a motivator rather than as an innovator; however, his teams were known for one signature play—the Green Bay sweep. The play, which saw the ball carrier dash around the end escorted by a host of blockers, was copied by virtually every football team in the 1960s and ’70s.
