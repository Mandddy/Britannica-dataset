Jean-Baptiste Pigalle,  (born January 26, 1714, Paris, Franceâ€”died August 21, 1785, Paris) French sculptor noted for his stylistically varied and original works.
Born into a family of master carpenters, Pigalle began training as a sculptor at age 18 with Robert Le Lorrain and then studied with Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne. After failing to win the Prix de Rome in 1735, he studied independently in Rome at his own expense from 1736 to 1739. His most famous work is the statue Mercury Attaching His Wings (1744), a classicizing work conveying qualities of both graceful ease and youthful vitality.
