Shih tzu, Tibetan dog breed developed from the Pekingese and the Lhasa apso. Listed in the toy group by the American Kennel Club, the shih tzu, called in Chinese shih-tzu kou (“lion dog”; Pinyin shizi gou), is a longhaired, characteristically active and alert little dog standing about 10 inches (25 cm) and weighing 9 to 16 pounds (4 to 7 kg). It is longer than it is tall and is sturdily built and short-legged, with a short muzzle, hanging ears, and a heavily haired tail carried over its back. Its dense coat, which may be a variety of colours, falls over its eyes and forms a beard and whiskers on the face.
