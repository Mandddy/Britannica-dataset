Jay Z, also spelled Jay-Z, original name Shawn Corey Carter  (born December 4, 1970, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American rapper and entrepreneur, one of the most influential figures in hip-hop in the 1990s and early 21st century.
Shawn Carter grew up in Brooklynâ€™s often dangerous Marcy Projects, where he was raised mainly by his mother. His firsthand experience with illicit drug dealing would inform his lyrics when he began rapping under the stage name Jazzy, soon shortened to Jay-Z (a name that may also have been derived from the proximity of the J and Z subway lines to the Marcy Projects). Jay-Z and two friends founded their own company, Roc-A-Fella Records, to release his debut album, Reasonable Doubt (1996), which eventually sold more than a million copies in the United States.
