Gaining early experience as a merchant in Hanover, N.H., and in Boston, Morton moved to New York in the mid-1850s to become a partner in a dry goods store. In 1863 he established the banking house of L.P. Morton and Company (dissolved 1899). He later served as an intermediary between President Ulysses S.
