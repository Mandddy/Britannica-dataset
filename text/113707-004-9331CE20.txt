Rowan Williams, Baron Williams of Oystermouth, in full Rowan Douglas Williams, Baron Williams of Oystermouth in the City and County of Swansea  (born June 14, 1950, Swansea, Wales) 104th archbishop of Canterbury (from 2002), a noted theologian, archbishop of the Church in Wales (2000–02), and the first archbishop of Canterbury in modern times chosen from outside the Church of England.
Williams was born into a Welsh-speaking family. After attending the Dyvenor Secondary School, he entered Christ’s College, Cambridge, where he earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in theology; he was awarded a doctorate of philosophy in theology by Wadham College, Oxford, in 1975. After teaching at the College of the Resurrection, Mirfield, he held a series of academic and ecclesiastical appointments, culminating in his professorship of divinity at Oxford (1986–92). He became bishop of Monmouth in 1992 and was enthroned as archbishop of Wales in 2000. His nomination as archbishop of Canterbury in 2002 generated significant controversy because of his liberal views on homosexuality and other matters, though he was supported by stalwarts of the church such as the Rev. Desmond Tutu. Williams opposed the Afghanistan War in 2001 and harshly criticized the Iraq War in 2003.
