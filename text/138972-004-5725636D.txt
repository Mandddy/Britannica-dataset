Zhenjiang was the seat of feudal domains from the 8th century bc onward, having been known first as Yi and later as Zhufang and Guyang. After the Qin conquest in 221 bce, it became a county and was given the name Dantu. It first became the seat of a higher administrative division during the mid-3rd century bce. During the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo) period (220–280 ce) the Wu kingdom had a walled town constructed there, which historically was known as Jingcheng or Jingzhen (now commonly called Jingkou). Following the conquest of southern China by the Sui in 581, the town was made a garrison, commanding the entrance to the Yangtze River, and in 595 it became a full prefecture named Yanling (later Runzhou). After 780 it was the seat of a military governor, whose army was called Zhenhai.
