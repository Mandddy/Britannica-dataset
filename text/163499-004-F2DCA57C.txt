François Anguier,  (born c. 1604, Eu, France—died Aug. 8, 1669, Paris) French sculptor who produced gisants and decorations for tombs, churches, palaces, and public monuments.
Anguier began his training in France and, about 1641, traveled to Rome, where he is believed to have studied in the workshop of the Baroque sculptor Alessandro Algardi until 1643. Anguier’s most characteristic work is the funerary statue of Gasparde de la Châtre, second wife of the historian Jacques de Thou. Between 1648 and 1652, Anguier collaborated with his brother Michel, who was also a noted sculptor, on a tomb for Henri II, duc de Montmorency, at Moulins.
