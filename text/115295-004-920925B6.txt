Abraham Flexner,  (born Nov. 13, 1866, Louisville, Ky., U.S.—died  Sept. 21, 1959, Falls Church, Va.) educator who played a major role in the introduction of modern medical and science education to American colleges and universities.
Founder and director of a progressive college-preparatory school in Louisville (1890–1904), Flexner issued an appraisal of American educational institutions (The American College: A Criticism; 1908) that earned him a Carnegie Foundation commission to survey the quality of the 155 medical colleges in the United States and Canada. His report (1910) had an immediate and sensational impact on American medical education. Many of the colleges that were severely criticized by Flexner closed soon after publication of the report; others initiated extensive revisions of their policies and curricula.
