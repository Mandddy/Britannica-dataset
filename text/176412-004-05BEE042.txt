The Four Feathers, British action-adventure film, released in 1939, that was based on the 1902 novel of the same name by A.E.W. Mason. It is widely considered to be the best of the many film adaptations of the book.
Harry Faversham (played by John Clements), a young British army officer, is descended from a line of military heroes. However, he resigns his commission rather than ship out with his comrades to avenge the death and beheading of the legendary general Charles George Gordon, killed during the Sudanese rebellion some 10 years earlier. In doing so, he receives three white feathers from his fellow officers—a traditional branding of cowardice. When his fiancée, Ethne Burroughs (June Duprez), fails to come to his defense, Faversham plucks a fourth feather from her fan. He later decides to redeem his reputation by traveling to North Africa, infiltrating enemy lines, and extricating his former comrades from potentially deadly situations—returning the feathers as he proves his courage.
