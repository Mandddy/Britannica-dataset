Karch Kiraly, byname of Charles Kiraly  (born November 3, 1960, Jackson, Michigan, U.S.) American athlete who was the first volleyball player to win three Olympic gold medals and was considered one of the sport’s greatest players, excelling at both indoor and beach volleyball.
When Kiraly was four years old, he moved with his family to Santa Barbara, California. His father, Laszlo Kiraly, had played on the Hungarian national volleyball team, and he introduced his son to the game at an early age; by the time Karch was 11 years old, he had entered his first beach tournament with his father. With a vertical leap of 41 inches (104 cm), Kiraly was a standout at Santa Barbara High School and during his senior year was named the best player in the state. He attended the University of California (B.S., 1983) in Los Angeles, where he was a four-time All-American and led his squad to three national titles (1979, 1980, 1981) in four years. In 1981 he joined the U.S. national volleyball team, and, as the squad’s outside hitter, he helped the United States win Olympic gold medals at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles and at the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea; at the latter event he was named the tournament’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). The U.S. team also won gold at the 1982 and 1986 world championships and at the 1987 Pan American Games. In 1986 and 1988 the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) named Kiraly the best player in the world.
