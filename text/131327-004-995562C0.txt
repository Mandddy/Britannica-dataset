Tapioca, a preparation of cassava root starch used as a food, in bread or as a thickening agent in liquid foods, notably puddings but also soups and juicy pies.
In processing, heat ruptures the starch grains, converting them to small irregular masses that are further baked into flake tapioca. A pellet form, known as pearl tapioca, is made by forcing the moist starch through sieves. Granulated tapioca, marketed in various-sized grains and sometimes called “manioca,” is produced by grinding flake tapioca. When cooked, tapioca swells into a pale, translucent jelly.
