Electronic shooter game, electronic game genre in which players control a character or unit that wields weapons to shoot enemies. While shooting games involving “light guns” and photoreceptors were experimented with as early as the 1930s, the birth of this genre of electronic games really began in 1962 with Spacewar!, a software program developed to show off the power of the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1 minicomputer. The game included stellar objects that generated gravitation fields, which two players had to take into account as they maneuvered their spacecraft while shooting at each other and various asteroids. American computer programmers Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney simplified the game to one person shooting alien spaceships, and this version was published by Nutting Associates as Computer Space (1971), the first mass-produced coin-operated electronic game, or arcade game. Bushnell and Dabney later founded Atari Inc., from which they released the first commercially successful arcade game, Pong (1972), an electronic sports game based on table tennis (Ping-Pong).
Although Computer Space had too steep a learning curve to prove a commercial success, the same cannot be said of Space Invaders (1978). An arcade console produced by Taito Corporation in Japan and licensed to Bally Technologies in the United States, Space Invaders was an enormous hit—so much so that Japan experienced a temporary shortage of 100-yen coins, which were used there to play the game. In 1980 Space Invaders became the first arcade game to be licensed for a home gaming console, the Atari 2600. Atari also released Asteroids (1979) and Missile Command (1980) as arcade games before they made their way to home console machines and personal computers (PCs).
