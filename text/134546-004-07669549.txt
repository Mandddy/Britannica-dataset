Claudius Dornier, English Claude Dornier  (born May 14, 1884, Kempten, Bavaria [Germany]—died December 5, 1969, Zug, Switzerland) pioneer German aircraft designer and builder.
Dornier completed his education in 1907 at Munich’s technical college and three years later began working for Ferdinand, Graf von Zeppelin, at the Zeppelin airship factory at Friedrichshafen. In 1911 he designed the first all-metal plane, and Zeppelin permitted him to found a separate division of the company, the Dornier aircraft works at Friedrichshafen. Wooden and metal fighters designed by Dornier were used by Germany in World War I, after which he assumed full control of his aircraft factory.
