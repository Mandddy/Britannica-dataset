Sarah Pierce,  (born June 26, 1767, Litchfield, Connecticut [U.S.]—died January 19, 1852, Litchfield) American educator, noted for the school that she developed from a small group of pupils studying in her home into one of the first major U.S. institutions for women, Litchfield Female Academy.
The school Pierce opened in her home in 1792 was so successful that in 1798 a group of Litchfield citizens presented her with a building to house the rapidly growing institution. Alongside Tapping Reeve’s already famous Litchfield Law School, Pierce’s school helped make Litchfield a leading centre of education in the United States.
