Snipe,  any of about 20 species belonging to the shorebird family Scolopacidae (order Charadriiformes). Snipes frequent wet meadows and marshes and occur in temperate and warm regions worldwide. They are short-legged, long-billed, chunky birds that are striped and barred in brown, black, and white. The wings are pointed and angular, the eyes rear-set. The bill is flexible and is used to probe mud for worms.
Snipes are solitary while breeding, but in migration several may appear together (a “wisp” of snipes) on mud flats, along with other shorebirds. In most species, the courting male circles high and then dives toward the female on the ground while “drumming” or “bleating” the air with its tail feathers. Courtship commonly takes place at dusk, in moonlight, or on overcast days.
