John Howard,  (born Sept. 2, 1726, Hackney, London, Eng.?—died  Jan. 20, 1790, Kherson, Ukraine, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]) English philanthropist and reformer in the fields of penology and public health.
On his father’s death in 1742, Howard inherited considerable wealth and traveled widely in Europe. He then became high sheriff in Bedfordshire in 1773. As part of his duties, he inspected Bedford jail and was appalled by the unsanitary conditions there. He was also shocked to learn that the jailers were not salaried officers but depended on fees from prisoners and that some prisoners had been acquitted by the courts but were kept in prison because they had not paid their fees. In 1774 Howard persuaded the House of Commons to pass two acts that stipulated (1) that discharged persons should be set at liberty in open court and that discharge fees should be abolished and (2) that justices should be required to see to the health of prisoners. Years afterward, however, Howard complained that the acts had not been “strictly obeyed.”
