Jean Anouilh, in full Jean-Marie-Lucien-Pierre Anouilh  (born June 23, 1910, Bordeaux, France—died  Oct. 3, 1987, Lausanne, Switz.) playwright who became one of the strongest personalities of the French theatre and achieved an international reputation. His plays are intensely personal messages; often they express his love of the theatre as well as his grudges against actors, wives, mistresses, critics, academicians, bureaucrats, and others. Anouilh’s characteristic techniques include the play within the play, flashbacks and flash forwards, and the exchange of roles.
The Anouilh family moved to Paris when Jean was a teenager, and it was there that he studied law and worked briefly in advertising. At the age of 18, however, he saw Jean Giraudoux’s drama Siegfried, in which he discovered a theatrical and poetic language that determined his career. He worked briefly as the secretary to the great actor-director Louis Jouvet.
