Janet Scudder, original name Netta Deweze Frazee Scudder  (born October 27, 1869, Terre Haute, Indiana, U.S.—died June 9, 1940, Rockport, Massachusetts) American sculptor remembered for the highly popular fountains she created for many private patrons and public institutions in the early 20th century.
Scudder attended the Cincinnati (Ohio) Academy of Art, where she adopted the first name Janet. She studied drawing, anatomy, and modeling and settled upon wood carving as her principal interest. In 1891 she moved to Chicago, and after brief employment as a wood-carver she became a studio assistant to the sculptor Lorado Taft. She helped Taft produce sculpture for the World’s Columbian Exposition and, in part through him, received commissions to create statues for the Illinois and Indiana buildings at the fair. She studied and worked in Paris with the American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies before settling in New York City, where she shortly thereafter received her first important commission, to create a seal for the New York Bar Association. Other commissions for architectural decoration and portrait medallions followed. She returned to Paris in 1896 and, through MacMonnies, sold several of her medallions to the Luxembourg Museum.
