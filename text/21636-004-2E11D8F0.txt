Dorothy Canfield Fisher, original name Dorothea Frances Canfield, pen name Dorothy Canfield  (born Feb. 17, 1879, Lawrence, Kan., U.S.—died Nov. 9, 1958, Arlington, Vt.) prolific American author of novels, short stories, children’s books, educational works, and memoirs.
Canfield received a Ph.D. in Romance languages from Columbia University in 1904, a rare accomplishment for a woman of her generation. In 1907 she married John Redwood Fisher and, under the pen name Dorothy Canfield, published her first novel, Gunhild. In the same year, she inherited her great-grandfather’s farm in Arlington, Vermont; the town appears (often with the skimpiest of literary veils) in many of her works, including Hillsboro People (1915), written with poet Sarah N. Cleghorn, and The Bent Twig (1915).
