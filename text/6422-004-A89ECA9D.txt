Bellows,  mechanical contrivance for creating a jet of air, consisting usually of a hinged box with flexible sides, which expands to draw in air through an inward opening valve and contracts to expel the air through a nozzle. The bellows was invented in the European Middle Ages and was commonly used to speed combustion, as in a blacksmith’s or ironworker’s forge, or to operate reed or pipe organs.
In its simplest form, a hand bellows consists of two flat boards of rectangular, circular, or pear shape, hinged at one end and connected around their edges by a wide band of flexible leather to form an airtight joint. Wire rings keep the leather from collapsing when the boards are separated suddenly and the pressure in the chamber is less than atmospheric. One of the boards has a hole in the centre, covered inside by a leather flap or valve that can open only inward. The outlet nozzle has a relatively small opening.
