Panthéon,  building in Paris that was begun about 1757 by the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot as the Church of Sainte-Geneviève to replace a much older church of that name on the same site. It was secularized during the French Revolution and dedicated to the memory of great Frenchmen, receiving the name Panthéon. Its design exemplified the Neoclassical return to a strictly logical use of classical architectural elements. The Panthéon is a cruciform building with a high dome over the crossing and lower saucer-shaped domes (covered by a sloping roof ) over the four arms. The facade, like that of the Roman Pantheon, is formed by a porch of Corinthian columns and triangular pediment attached to the ends of the eastern arm.
The interior is decorated with mosaics and paintings of scenes from French history, some of which were executed by Puvis de Chavannes. The pediment has sculptures by Pierre-Jean David d’Angers of post-Revolutionary patriots. The Panthéon was reconsecrated and resecularized several times during the 19th century, serving as a church in 1828–30 and in 1851–70. Today it is a civic building that serves as a repository for the remains of great French citizens, including Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, Èmile Zola, and Marie Curie.
