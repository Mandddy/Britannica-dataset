Dixie Chicks, American country music group that achieved crossover success in the pop market. The group’s principal members included Martie Maguire (née Erwin; b. October 12, 1969, York, Pennsylvania, U.S.), Emily Robison (née Erwin; b. August 16, 1972, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, U.S.), and Natalie Maines (b. October 14, 1974, Lubbock, Texas, U.S.). Early members of the group included guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, who left in 1992, and vocalist Laura Lynch, who was replaced by Maines in 1995.
Before Lynch’s departure, the group released three albums—Thank Heavens for Dale Evans (1990), Little Ol’ Cowgirl (1992), and Shouldn’t a Told You That (1993). With Martie Erwin playing the fiddle and mandolin and her sister Emily on the banjo, guitar, dobro, and bass, the Dixie Chicks became known for their instrumental prowess. Following the installation of Maines as lead singer, the group signed with Monument Records and began to revamp its cowgirl image and sound, eventually emerging as sophisticated performers with a hit country single, “I Can Love You Better” (1997). The lineup’s debut album, Wide Open Spaces (1998), sold more than 12 million copies in the United States and was named best country album at the 1999 Grammy Awards ceremony. “There’s Your Trouble” won the Grammy for best country group vocal performance.
