Jackal, any of several species of wolflike carnivores of the dog genus, Canis, family Canidae, sharing with the hyena an exaggerated reputation for cowardice. Four species are usually recognized: the golden, or Asiatic, jackal (C. aureus), found from eastern Europe to Southeast Asia, the African golden wolf (C. anthus), found in northern and eastern Africa, and the black-backed (C. mesomelas) and side-striped (C. adustus) jackals of southern and eastern Africa. Jackals grow to a length of about 85–95 cm (34–37 inches), including the 30–35-cm (12–14-inch) tail, and weigh about 7–11 kg (15–24 pounds). Golden jackals and African golden wolves are yellowish, the black-backed jackal is rusty red with a black back, and the side-striped jackal is grayish with a white-tipped tail and an indistinct stripe on each side.
Jackals inhabit open country. They are nocturnal animals that usually conceal themselves by day in brush or thickets and sally forth at dusk to hunt. They live alone, in pairs, or in packs and feed on whatever small animals, plant material, or carrion is available. They follow lions and other large cats in order to finish a carcass when the larger animal has eaten its fill. When hunting in packs, they are able to bring down prey as large as an antelope or sheep.
