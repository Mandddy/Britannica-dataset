Whist, trick-taking card game developed in England. The English national card game has passed through many phases of development, being first recorded as trump (1529), then ruff, ruff and honours, whisk and swabbers, whisk, and finally whist in the 18th century. In the 19th century whist became the premier intellectual card game of the Western world, but bridge superseded it in this position by about 1900. Partnership whist, with four players in two partnerships, remains popular in Britain in the form of social and fund-raising events called whist drives.
In the classic game each player received 13 cards from a 52-card deck ranking A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. The last card dealt (to the dealer) was shown and established the trump suit. Eldest hand (player on dealer’s immediate left) led to the first trick, and the winner of each trick led to the next. Players followed suit if possible; otherwise, they could play any card. The trick was taken by the highest card of the suit led or by the highest trump if any were played. The side capturing the most tricks scored one point per “odd trick” (over and above six tricks). If either partnership held three or four of the “honours” (ace, king, queen, and jack in the trump suit), whether in one hand or between the two partners, they scored two or four points, respectively, unless this brought them to “game” (winning score), when honours were ignored. Game was five points (British) or seven points (American), and reaching it precluded the other side from scoring for honours. The winners counted a single stake or game point if the losers made three or four points, double if the losers made only one or two points, and triple for a whitewash (“shutout”). The first to win two games added two game points for the rubber.
