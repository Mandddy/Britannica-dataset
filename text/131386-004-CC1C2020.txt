Corporal punishment, the infliction of physical pain upon a person’s body as punishment for a crime or infraction. Corporal punishments include flogging, beating, branding, mutilation, blinding, and the use of the stock and pillory. In a broad sense, the term also denotes the physical disciplining of children in the schools and at home.
Early Babylonian law developed the principle of lex talionis, which asserted that criminals should receive as punishment precisely those injuries they had inflicted upon their victims. Many subsequent societies applied this “eye-for-an-eye and tooth-for-a-tooth” principle quite literally in dealing with offenders. From ancient times through the 18th century, corporal punishments were commonly used in those instances that did not call for the death penalty or for exile or transportation. But the growth of humanitarian ideals during the Enlightenment and afterward led to the gradual abandonment of corporal punishment, and by the later 20th century it had been almost entirely replaced by imprisonment or other nonviolent penalties.
