August, Graf von Platen, in full August, Graf von Platen-Hallermünde, Hallermünde also spelled Hallermund   (born Oct. 24, 1796, Ansbach, principality of Ansbach [Germany]—died  Dec. 5, 1835, Syracuse, Sicily) German poet and dramatist who was almost unique among his contemporaries in aiming at classical purity of style; although he was schooled in the Romantic tradition, he opposed its undisciplined flamboyance.
Platen entered the Bavarian life guards in 1814 and attended the University of Würzburg in 1818. In 1819 he moved to Erlangen, where he studied under the philosopher of Romanticism, Friedrich Schelling, and made the acquaintance of many of the leading writers of the time, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He became a first-rate scholar and published a little book of poems, Ghaselen (1821; “Ghazals”), in which he imitated the style of his friend Friedrich Rückert. This was soon followed by other volumes.
