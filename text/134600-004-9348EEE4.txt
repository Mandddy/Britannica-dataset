Ivor Novello, original name David Ivor Davies  (born Jan. 15, 1893, Cardiff, Glamorganshire, Wales—died  March 6, 1951, London, Eng.) Welsh actor-manager, composer, and playwright, best known for his lush, sentimental, romantic musicals.
Novello, the son of the celebrated Welsh singing teacher, Dame Clara Novello Davies, was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and served with the Royal Naval Air Service during World War I. He became famous with a phenomenally successful patriotic wartime song, “Keep the Home Fires Burning” (1915). After he was demobilized in 1919, he accepted a motion-picture role in The Call of the Blood, and he acted in several other motion pictures throughout his career. His real love, however, was the theatre.
