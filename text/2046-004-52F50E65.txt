Paleo-Siberian languages, Paleo-Siberian also spelled Paleosiberian, also called Paleo-Asiatic languages or Hyperborean languages,  languages spoken in Asian Russia (Siberia) that belong to four genetically unrelated groupsâ€”Yeniseian, Luorawetlan, Yukaghir, and Nivkh.
The Yeniseian group is spoken in the Turukhansk region along the Yenisey River. Its only living members are Ket (formerly called Yenisey-Ostyak), which is spoken by about 500 persons, and Yug, with no more than 5 speakers. Kott (Kot; also called Assan or Asan), Arin, and Pumpokol, now extinct members of this group, were spoken chiefly to the south of the present-day locus of Ket and Yug.
