Elmer Rice, original name Elmer Reizenstein   (born Sept. 28, 1892, New York Cityâ€”died May 8, 1967, Southampton, Hampshire, Eng.) American playwright, director, and novelist noted for his innovative and polemical plays.
Rice graduated from the New York Law School in 1912 but soon turned to writing plays. His first work, the melodramatic On Trial (1914), was the first play to employ on stage the motion-picture technique of flashbacks, in this case to present the recollections of witnesses at a trial. In The Adding Machine (1923) Rice adapted techniques from German Expressionist theatre to depict the dehumanization of man in the 20th century. His most important play, Street Scene (1929), was a starkly realistic tragedy set outside a New York City slum tenement building. The play won a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into a highly popular musical (1947) with lyrics by Langston Hughes and music by Kurt Weill. Counsellor-at-Law (1931) was a rather critical look at the legal profession. In We, the People (1933), Judgment Day (1934), and several other polemical plays of the 1930s, Rice treated the evils of Nazism, the poverty of the Great Depression, and racism. He continued to write for the stage after 1945, but without much acclaim.
