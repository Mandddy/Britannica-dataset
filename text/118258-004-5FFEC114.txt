Waterleaf, any of about eight species of herbaceous plants constituting a genus (Hydrophyllum) in the borage family (Boraginaceae) and native to damp woodlands of North America. Light-greenish mottling on the leaves, suggesting watermarks on paper, gives the genus its name. Notable members of the genus are the 75-cm- (2.5-foot-) tall Virginia waterleaf (Hydrophyllum virginianum), with five- to seven-lobed leaves; it is also called Shawnee salad and Johnâ€™s cabbage in reference to the edible tender young shoots. The large-leaved waterleaf (H. macrophyllum) is similar to the Virginia waterleaf but is rough and hairy and about 60 cm tall. The broad-leaved waterleaf (H. canadense), also 60 cm tall, has maplelike leaves. Some species are used in wildflower gardens; they are valued for their attractive leaves and clusters of small white to purplish flowers with stamens that extend beyond the petals.
