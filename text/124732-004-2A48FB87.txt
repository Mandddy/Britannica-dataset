Primitive weevil (family Brentidae), also known as straight-snouted weevils,  any of approximately 2,000 species of beetles related to the weevil family Curculionidae (insect order Coleoptera) that are predominantly tropical, although some species occur in temperate regions. The female uses her long, straight snout to bore holes in trees in which she lays her eggs. The maleâ€™s snout is short, broad, and flat. Most species are between 7 and 30 mm (0.3 to 1.2 inches) in length and are dark in colour with orange markings on the wing covers (elytra). The adults live under loose bark on dead trees, feeding on fungi, sap, and other insects. The larvae bore through wood and may cause considerable damage to living trees.
