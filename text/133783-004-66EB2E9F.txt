Franz Werfel,  (born Sept. 10, 1890, Prague [now in Czech Republic]—died Aug. 26, 1945, Hollywood, Calif., U.S.) German-language writer who attained prominence as an Expressionist poet, playwright, and novelist and whose works espoused human brotherhood, heroism, and religious faith.
The son of a glove manufacturer, Werfel left home to work in a Hamburg shipping house. Shortly afterward he published two books of lyric poems, Der Weltfreund (1911; “The World’s Friend”) and Wir sind (1913; “We Are”). After fighting on the Italian and Galician fronts in World War I, he became antimilitary, recited pacifistic poems in cafés, and was arrested. His playwriting career began in 1916 with an adaptation of Euripides’ Trojan Women, which had a successful run in Berlin. He turned to fiction in 1924 with Verdi, Roman der Oper (Verdi, A Novel of the Opera). In 1929 he married Alma Mahler. International fame came with Die vierzig Tage des Musa Dagh (1933; The Forty Days of Musa Dagh), an epic novel in which Armenian villagers resist Turkish forces until rescued by the French.
