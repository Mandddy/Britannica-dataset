Isaac Stern,  (born July 21, 1920, Kremenets, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died September 22, 2001, New York, New York, U.S.) Russian-born American musician who was considered one of the premier violinists of the 20th century.
Stern was taken by his parents to San Francisco as a one-year-old. At age 6 he began taking piano lessons, but his interest soon turned to the violin. He studied at the San Francisco Conservatory (1928–31) and with the Russian violinist Naoum Blinder (1932–39) and in 1935 made his San Francisco Symphony debut. After a highly successful New York concert in 1939, he rapidly gained recognition with his expressive playing. He began to tour regularly after his European debut in 1948, appearing all over the world and at all the major festivals. He premiered works by Paul Hindemith, George Rochberg, and Krzysztof Penderecki. In 1960 he formed a trio with pianist Eugene Istomin and cellist Leonard Rose. Among their acclaimed recordings were the complete trios of Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Johannes Brahms. The group toured extensively, and to honour Beethoven’s bicentennial they performed a series of concerts around the world. Following Rose’s death in 1984, Stern teamed up with cellist Yo-Yo Ma and pianist Emanuel Ax.
