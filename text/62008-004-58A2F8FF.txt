Mary Ann Dyke Duff, née Mary Ann Dyke  (born 1794, London, Eng.—died Sept. 5, 1857, New York, N.Y., U.S.) American tragic actress who, at the peak of her career, was as highly regarded as the famed English actress Sarah Siddons.
Mary Ann Dyke early took up the study of ballet under the ballet master of the King’s Theatre. In 1809 she and her two sisters made their dancing debut at the Dublin Theatre. At a subsequent performance in Kilkenny she met the poet Thomas Moore, who fell in love with her. She is said to have inspired several of his love lyrics. In 1810, however, she married Moore’s friend John R. Duff, an actor—Moore then married her sister Elizabeth—and sailed with him to Boston. She made her American debut in Romeo and Juliet at the Federal Street Theatre on December 31, 1810. She and her husband played in Boston until 1812, then with a Philadelphia company until 1817, when they returned to Boston.
