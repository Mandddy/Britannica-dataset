Robert B. Zoellick, in full Robert Bruce Zoellick  (born July 25, 1953, Evergreen Park, Illinois, U.S.) American politician who was the 11th president of the World Bank (2007–12).
Zoellick grew up in Naperville, Illinois, outside Chicago. He received a B.A. (1975) in history from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, a law degree (1979) from Harvard Law School, and a Master of Public Policy degree (1981) from Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. He subsequently worked in the administrations of three Republican presidents of the United States. Under Pres. Ronald Reagan he was a deputy assistant secretary (1985–88) in the Treasury Department. In the administration of Pres. George H.W. Bush, Zoellick was an undersecretary of state (1989–92) before serving (1992–93) as the White House deputy chief of staff and an assistant to the president. He was the principal U.S. representative in talks on German reunification, and he represented Bush in 1991 and 1992 at summits of the Group of Seven (forerunner of the Group of Eight). From 1993 to 1997 Zoellick was a vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and during this time he also taught at the U.S. Naval Academy and was a scholar at the Kennedy School of Government. He was an adviser to George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential campaign, and upon Bush’s election Zoellick once again entered government service. As U.S. trade representative (2001–05), he greatly expanded the number of free-trade pacts with countries throughout the world. He completed negotiations that brought China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and was influential in getting congressional approval of the Trade Act of 2002, restoring so-called fast-track authority to the president. In 2005–06 he was deputy secretary of state, dealing particularly with China and Sudan. After leaving the administration in June 2006, Zoellick became a vice-chairman of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.
