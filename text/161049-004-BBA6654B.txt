Matt Lauer, in full Matthew Todd Lauer  (born December 30, 1957, New York City, New York, U.S.) American journalist and television host best known as the cohost of Today, a weekday morning news and talk show airing on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) television network.
Lauer’s television career began in 1979, when he left Ohio University four credits short of a degree to take an internship at the West Virginia television station WOWK. He soon became a news producer and an on-air reporter for the station. During the next 10 years, he reported for various stations throughout the East Coast and hosted the nationally syndicated PM Magazine, a news and entertainment program, from 1980 to 1986. In 1989 he relocated to New York, where he briefly hosted several television shows and later became the cohost of the talk show 9 Broadway Plaza. He became coanchor of Today in New York in 1992 and coanchor of Live at Five in 1993; both shows aired on WNBC-TV. His work for NBC in the local New York media market gave him access to the network’s national news broadcasts, and he began to fill in as a newsreader and coanchor on Today. Lauer also was called in as a substitute on Weekend Today and NBC News at Sunrise. In 1994 he became a regular news anchor for Today and the program’s cohost in 1997. That same year he received his degree from Ohio University.
