Tournament, also called tourney,  series of military exercises, probably of medieval French origin and confined to western Europe, in which knights fought one another to display their skill and courage. Tournaments had become more pageantry than combat by the end of the 16th century, and the term is still used somewhat in this sense—for instance, in the Royal Tournament, an annual naval and military display held in London, and the New Year’s Day Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, California.
In the early 20th century, the word tournament also came to be applied to certain methods of conducting sports competitions. In the most common modern tournament, the contestants are matched in pairs, with the losers in each test eliminated and the winners paired anew until only one remains as the champion of the tournament. In some tournaments, called double-elimination tournaments, the contestant is not eliminated until defeated a second time. In a third form, called a round robin, each contestant opposes every other contestant and the one with the highest percentage of victories is declared the champion.
