Nuba, inhabitants of the Nuba Hills in the Kordofan region of central-southern Sudan. This region is studded with rugged granite hills that rise sharply from a wide clay plain and vary considerably in size and content.
The Nuba peoples live on or near the hills (the plains being mainly occupied by Baqqārah Arabs); the many groups differ in physical type and culture. They all speak Nubian languages, which are Eastern Sudanic languages of the Nilo-Saharan language family.
