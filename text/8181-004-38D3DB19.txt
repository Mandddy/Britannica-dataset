Chinese shar-pei, breed of dog noted for its loose skin and wrinkles. Once considered one of the rarest dog breeds, the Chinese shar-pei has enjoyed great popularity beginning in the late 20th century, and its numbers have grown significantly.
Of medium size, the Chinese shar-pei stands 18 to 20 inches (45 to 50 cm) and weighs 45 to 60 pounds (21 to 28 kg). The breed’s name (shar-pei: “sand-skin”) refers to the short, rough coat, which appears in a number of colours, including cream, red, or chocolate. Although heavily wrinkled as a puppy, the dog loses most of its creases, except those on the face and shoulders, as it matures. The distinct muzzle, broad and full, has been compared to that of a hippopotamus. Chinese shar-peis have blue-black tongues as do chow chows, though it is unclear if the two breeds are related.
