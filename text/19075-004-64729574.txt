Thomas Shadwell,  (born 1642?, Norfolk, England—died November 19, 1692, London) English dramatist and poet laureate, known for his broad comedies of manners and as the butt of John Dryden’s satire.
Educated at Caius College, Cambridge, and at the Middle Temple, London, after the Restoration (1660) Shadwell became one of the court wits and an acquaintance of Sir Robert Howard and his brother, Edward. He satirized both Howards in The Sullen Lovers (1668), an adaptation of Molière’s Les Fâcheux.
