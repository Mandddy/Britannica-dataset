John Gerard,  (born 1545, Nantwich, Cheshire, Eng.—died  February 1612, London) English herbalist, author of The Herball, or generall historie of plantes (1597).
In 1562 Gerard went to London to become an apprentice to a barber-surgeon and, after seven years, was granted permission to establish his own practice. While studying in London, he became interested in plants and began a garden near his cottage in Holborn, London. Both the garden and its owner soon became popular, and Gerard was often presented not only with rare plants and seeds from different parts of the world but also with offers to supervise the gardens of noblemen. In 1596 he compiled a list of the plants growing in his garden. Published in 1597, his celebrated Herball, containing more than 1,000 species, became the first plant catalog. Although Gerard took almost complete credit for the work, it may actually have been based on a translation of Stirpium historiae pemptades sex (1583), by the Flemish botanist Rembertus Dodoens. Of the more than 1,800 woodcuts illustrating the book, only 16 were done by Gerard. The remainder came from Jacob Theodorus Tabernaemontanus’ Eicones plantarum seu stirpium (1590).
