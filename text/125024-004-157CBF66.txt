Siegfried Line, system of pillboxes and strongpoints built along the German western frontier in the 1930s and greatly expanded in 1944. In 1944, during World War II, German troops retreating from France found it an effective barrier for a respite against the pursuing Americans. This respite helped the Germans mount their counteroffensive in the Ardennes forest, and the Allies did not break through the entire line until early 1945.
