John Gilbert, original name John Cecil Pringle  (born July 10, 1899, Logan, Utah, U.S.—died January 9, 1936, Los Angeles, Calif.) romantic leading man of the silent era, known as the “Great Lover.” In retrospect, his acting career has been overshadowed by his identification as the tragic star who failed to make the transition to sound.
The son of a small-time acting family, Gilbert began his screen career in 1916 as an extra at Inceville, the Los Angeles studio headed by film pioneer Thomas Ince. For eight years, Gilbert toiled at different studios in front of and behind the camera. At first unchallenged by acting, he served as a writer at Paralta studios and then as a production assistant to director Maurice Tourneur. In 1921 he became a featured player at the Fox Film Corporation and then a star shortly after signing a contract in 1924 with the newly formed MGM.
