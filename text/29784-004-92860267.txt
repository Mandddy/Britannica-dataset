Barron River, river in northeastern Queensland, Australia, rising near Herberton in the Hugh Nelson Range of the Eastern Highlands and flowing north across the Atherton Plateau past Mareeba and then east and south through the Barron Gorge to enter the Pacific Ocean at Trinity Bay, just north of Cairns, after a course of 100 miles (160 km). The river, draining a basin of 835 square miles (2,160 square km), was named in 1870 after T.H. Barron, a chief clerk of the state police.
Fed by the Clohesy River and Mazzlin, Rocky, and Flaggy creeks, the Barron is dammed to form Tinaroo Reservoir (1958), which supplies irrigation water for a tobacco and mixed-farming area, and bisects Barron Falls National Park. The Barron Falls, 10 miles (16 km) above the riverâ€™s mouth, are accessible from the town of Kuranda; the series of cascades plunges 980 feet (300 metres) to the coastal plain and has been harnessed for hydroelectric power.
