Alexander VIII, original name Pietro Vito Ottoboni  (born April 22, 1610, Venice [Italy]—died Feb. 1, 1691, Rome) pope from 1689 to 1691, best known for his condemnation of Gallicanism, a French clerical and political movement that sought to limit papal authority.
Ottoboni was born into a weathly Venetian family. He was a distinguished student at the University of Padua and subsequently became an expert on canon law. He was made cardinal in 1652 and bishop of Brescia in 1654 and was elected pope on Oct. 6, 1689, at age 79. As Pope Alexander VIII, he initiated measures that led eventually (after his death) to a solution of long-standing disputes between the papacy and King Louis XIV of France concerning such matters as jurisdiction over the appointment of bishops, the pope’s role in temporal affairs, and the validity of the crown’s claim to the treasuries of unfilled bishoprics.
