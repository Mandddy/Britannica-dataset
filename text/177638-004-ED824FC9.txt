Nicholas Ray, original name Raymond Nicholas Kienzle   (born August 7, 1911, Galesville, Wisconsin, U.S.—died June 16, 1979, New York, New York) American motion-picture writer and director whose reputation as one of the most expressive and distinctive filmmakers of the late 1940s and the ’50s is grounded on a clutch of stylish heartfelt films that frequently focused on alienated outcasts, including They Live by Night (1948), In a Lonely Place (1950), and, most notably, Rebel Without a Cause (1955). Ray was among the directors most ardently championed as cinematic auteurs by the critics and filmmakers of the French New Wave who were associated with the influential journal Cahiers du Cinéma, especially Jean-Luc Godard, who once said that “the cinema is Nicholas Ray.”
Ray grew up in a family of German and Norwegian origin in and around La Crosse, Wisconsin. His father, a contractor, also operated a brick factory. After briefly attending the University of Chicago, Ray spent several months at Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin school, where he participated in activities associated with the community’s playhouse and studied architecture. In New York City in the 1930s, Ray joined the leftist communal theatre group Theatre of Action (where he met director Elia Kazan) and worked on Federal Theatre Project productions with Joseph Losey and John Houseman. In the late 1930s, in Washington, D.C., Ray worked on a theatre outreach program for the Resettlement Administration and came into contact with folk musicians such as Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly while working with Alan Lomax at the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. During the early years of World War II, Ray directed and supervised radio propaganda programs for the Office of War Information under Houseman. In 1944 Ray followed Kazan to Hollywood to be his assistant on the film A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945).
