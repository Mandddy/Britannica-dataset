Skimmer, any of three species of water birds that constitute the family Rynchopidae in the order Charadriiformes. The skimmer is distinguished by a unique bladelike bill, the lower mandible of which is one-third longer than the upper mandible.
By day the skimmer rests onshore, and at twilight the bird feeds, skimming calm, shallow water with the bill tip submerged; when a fish or crustacean is encountered, the upper mandible snaps down. Skimmers nest in small colonies, laying three to five eggs. The young are fed by regurgitation until the mandibles assume their adult form.
