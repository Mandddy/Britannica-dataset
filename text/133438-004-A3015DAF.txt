Karīm Khān Zand (Moḥammad),  (born c. 1705—died  March 1779, Shīrāz, Zand Iran) first Zand ruler of Iran. He restored peace to the kingdom after the strife following the collapse of the Ṣafavid dynasty.
Of humble tribal origin, Karīm Khān became one of the generals of his predecessor, Nāder Shāh. In the chaotic aftermath of Nāder Shāh’s assassination in 1747, Karīm Khān became a major contender for power but was challenged by several adversaries. In order to add legitimacy to his claim, Karīm Khān in 1757 placed on the throne the infant Shāh Ismāʿīl III, the grandson of the last official Ṣafavid king. Ismāʿīl was a figurehead king, real power being vested in Karīm Khān, who never claimed the title of shāhānshāh (“king of kings”) but used that of vakīl (“regent”).
