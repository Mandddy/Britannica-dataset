Book collecting, acquisition of books, not only as texts but also as objects desirable for such qualities as their age, scarcity, historical significance, value, beauty, and evidence of association with some important person. Exercising knowledge, taste, and critical judgment, the book collector forms a special kind of library, intended not only for reference, current reading, or entertainment but also for comprehensiveness and quality within the areas it covers. Although such a library may (and often does) exist simply for the collector’s own pleasure, the very private and personal activity of book collecting may have significant public benefits.
Private collections have provided the cornerstones of many of the world’s great libraries. The University of Oxford’s famous library, for example, bears the name of its benefactor, Sir Thomas Bodley (see Bodleian Library), and the collection formed by Charles V, king of France in the 14th century, lies at the heart of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. At the University of Manchester the John Rylands University Library contains the extensive collection of early European printing amassed by Lord Spencer (George John, 2nd Earl Spencer), as well as professor Richard Copley Christie’s important collection of 15th- and 16th-century publications. In Washington, D.C., the Folger Shakespeare Library represents the life’s work of American industrialist and collector Henry Clay Folger and his wife, Emily Jordan Folger.
