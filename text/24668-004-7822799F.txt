Joseph Fesch,  (born Jan. 3, 1763, Ajaccio, Corsica [now in France]—died  May 13, 1839, Rome, Papal States [Italy]) French cardinal who was Napoleon’s ambassador to the Vatican in Rome.
Fesch was a Corsican and the half brother of Napoleon’s mother. After studies at the Seminary of Aix (1781–86) he became archdeacon of the cathedral chapter of his native city of Ajaccio. During the French Revolution, the Bonaparte family opposed the Corsican revolution of Pasquale Paoli, a native revolutionary leader, and Fesch was forced to join them in emigration to Toulon, Fr., in 1793. Soon after, he left the church and made a considerable fortune through business ventures and accompanied Napoleon to Italy as a supply contractor (1795–97).
