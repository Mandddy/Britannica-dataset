Epsomite,  a common sulfate mineral, hydrated magnesium sulfate (MgSO4Â·7H2O). Its deposits are formed by evaporation of mineral waters, as at Epsom, Surrey, Eng., where it was discovered in 1695. It also is found as crusts and efflorescences in coal or metal mines, in limestone caves, and in the oxidized zones of sulfide ore deposits. The purified compound is used in medicine as Epsom salts. For detailed physical and mineralogic properties, see sulfate mineral (table).
