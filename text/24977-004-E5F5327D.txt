Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet,  (born 1715, Smithtown, County Meath, Ire.â€”died July 11, 1774, near Johnstown, N.Y.) pioneer in the Mohawk Valley, New York, whose service as colonial superintendent of Indian affairs was largely responsible for keeping the Iroquois neutral and even friendly to the British in the latter stages of the struggle with the French for control of North America.
Immigrating to the New World in 1737, Johnson purchased his first tract of land two years later, thus beginning the acquisitions that eventually made him one of the largest landholders and wealthiest settlers in British America. His rapport with neighbouring Indians began early on his estate, Mount Johnson, on the north bank of the Mohawk River, which became a centre of Indian trade and a shelter for the Mohawks. He tried to indoctrinate the natives in European ways by encouraging educational and missionary activities. His ties with the Indians were further cemented when, following the death of his first wife, he married successively two Mohawk women. The second of these was Molly Brant, sister of the Indian leader Joseph Brant.
