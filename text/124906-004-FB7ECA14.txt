Wall Street, street, in the southern section of the borough of Manhattan in New York City, which has been the location of some of the chief financial institutions of the United States. The street is narrow and short and extends only about seven blocks from Broadway to the East River. It was named for an earthen wall built by Dutch settlers in 1653 to repel an expected English invasion. Even before the American Civil War the street was recognized as the financial capital of the nation. The Wall Street district, commonly called the Financial District, contains the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex Equities, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The headquarters of many investment banks, government and municipal securities dealers, trust companies, utilities, insurance companies, and brokerage firms have also been located in the district.
Wall Street is a worldwide symbol of high finance and investment and, as such, has entered modern mythology. To 19th-century Populists, Wall Street was a symbol of the rapacious robber barons who exploited farmers and labourers. In prosperous times Wall Street has symbolized the route to quick riches. After the devastating stock market crash of 1929, Wall Street seemed the bastion of financial manipulators able to destabilize national economies.
