Mimetite,  arsenate mineral, lead chloride arsenate [Pb5(AsO4)3Cl], in the pyromorphite series of the apatite group of phosphates. Its colour ranges from brown to olive green, yellow, or orange. It greatly resembles pyromorphite, in which phosphorus replaces arsenic in the crystal structure; mimetite is similar in physical characteristics and mode of occurrence (barrel-shaped crystals or rounded masses) but is less common. Mimetite also forms a continuous solid-solution series with vanadinite in which vanadium replaces mimetiteâ€™s arsenic in the crystal structure. Campylite is any member of the pyromorphite-mimetite series distinguished by distorted crystals with curved faces. For detailed physical properties, see arsenate mineral (table).
