Shenandoah National Park, preserve of 311 square miles (805 square km) in the Blue Ridge section of the Appalachian Mountains, in northern Virginia, U.S. The park was authorized in 1926 and established in 1935.
The park is noted for its scenery, which affords some of the most spectacular panoramic views in the eastern states. Skyline Drive, 105 miles (169 km) long, runs the length of the park from north to south, winding among the peaks and through valleys and gaps. This accessibility to the crest of the Blue Ridge is because of the great age of the granitic and metamorphosed basaltic mountains, which have been rounded and worn down by millions of years of erosion.
