Robert William Thomson,  (born June 29, 1822, Stonehaven, Kincardineshire, Scotland—died March 8, 1873, Edinburgh) Scottish engineer and entrepreneur, inventor of the pneumatic tire.
Thomson was the son of the owner of a woollen mill and was sent at age 14 to Charleston, South Carolina, U.S., to live with an uncle and learn the merchant’s trade. Two years later he returned to Scotland, where he worked on various inventions, apprenticed in engineering workshops in Aberdeen and Dundee, and learned civil engineering in Edinburgh and Glasgow. While working in Edinburgh, he invented a system for detonating demolition explosives by electricity. Thomson then went to London and joined the South Eastern Railway Company, where he worked under prominent engineers Sir William Cubitt and Robert Stephenson (the latter the son of pioneering railway engineer George Stephenson).
