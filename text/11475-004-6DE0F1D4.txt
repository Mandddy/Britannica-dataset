Giuseppe Giusti,  (born May 13, 1809, Monsummano, Tuscany—died  March 31, 1850, Florence) northern Italian poet and satirist, whose satires on Austrian rule during the early years of Italy’s nationalistic movement (the Risorgimento) had great influence and are still enjoyed for their Tuscan wit and lively style.
Giusti was sporadically a law student in Pisa (1826–29 and 1832–34) and led an inconspicuous life until the Revolution of 1848. He then sat as a deputy in the two Tuscan legislative assemblies and in the short-lived constituent assembly (until April 1849).
