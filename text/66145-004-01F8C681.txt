Kirk Douglas, original name Issur Danielovitch also called Isadore Demsky  (born December 9, 1916, Amsterdam, New York, U.S.) American film actor and producer best known for his portrayals of resolute, emotionally charged heroes and antiheroes.
The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Douglas worked as an usher, a bellhop, a waiter, and a professional wrestler while attending St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York (B.A., 1939) and the American Academy of Dramatic Art (1939–41) in New York City. He played mostly minor roles on Broadway before and soon after service in the U.S. Navy (1943–44) and then was drawn to Hollywood. After his first film, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946) with Barbara Stanwyck, Douglas played supporting roles in several notable films, including Out of the Past (1947), Mourning Becomes Electra (1947), and I Walk Alone (1948). He emerged as a star with an Oscar-nominated performance as a ruthless boxer in Champion (1949). In this film, Douglas established a screen persona of a cocky, intense, self-absorbed individual. His on-screen charisma made him an audience favourite despite numerous such roles in which he portrayed men with an abundance of tragic flaws. “I’ve made a career of playing sons-of-bitches,” he once said.
