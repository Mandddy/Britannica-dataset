Pasig River,  river draining Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines, into Manila Bay at Manila. It flows north-northwest through the market town of Pasig and bisects Manila, then enters the bay between the North and South harbours. Its length is 14 mi (23 km). The wharves and quays at the riverâ€™s mouth served the early interisland trade during the Spanish colonial period. At that time the Pasig was home for a large barge- and raft-dwelling population. The shallow and sluggish stream is now spanned by nine bridges and is navigable by small craft, but its port functions have decreased.
