Rom, plural Roma, also called Gypsy, also spelled Gipsy,  any member of the traditionally itinerant people who originated in northern India but live in modern times worldwide, principally in Europe. Most Roma speak some form of Romany, a language closely related to the modern Indo-European languages of northern India, as well as the major language of the country in which they live. It is generally agreed that Roma groups left India in repeated migrations and that they were in Persia by the 11th century, in southeastern Europe by the beginning of the 14th, and in western Europe by the 15th century. By the second half of the 20th century they had spread to every inhabited continent.
Most Roma refer to themselves by one generic name, Rom (meaning “man” or “husband”), and to all non-Roma by the term gadje (also spelled gadze or gaje; a term with a pejorative connotation meaning “bumpkin,” “yokel,” or “barbarian”). Many Roma consider the name Gypsy to be pejorative.
