Ogata Kenzan, original name Ogata Shinsei, also called Kenzan  (born 1663, Kyōto, Japan—died June 3, 1743, Edo [now Tokyo]) Japanese potter and painter, brother to the artist Ogata Kōrin. He signed himself Kenzan, Shisui, Tōin, Shōkosai, Shuseidō, or Shinshō.
Kenzan received a classical Chinese and Japanese education and pursued Zen Buddhism. At the age of 27 he began studying with the potter Ninsei and in 1699 established his own kiln in Narutaki. Encountering financial difficulties, he moved in 1712 to Nijō, in central Kyōto, where he established another kiln. But difficulties pursued him there, and in 1731 he moved to Edo and built still another kiln.
