Charles Churchill,  (born February 1731, London, Eng.—died  Nov. 4, 1764, Boulogne, France) English poet noted for his lampoons and polemical satires written in heroic couplets.
Churchill was educated at Westminster School. Although he was delayed in taking orders by an early and imprudent marriage, he was ordained in 1756 and, in 1758, on his father’s death, succeeded him as curate of a Westminster parish. In 1761 or 1762 he became friends with the champion of liberty of the press, John Wilkes, and his collaboration with Wilkes thereafter earned him an honourable place in the history of parliamentary democracy and civil liberties. But he won his fame independently in 1761 with The Rosciad, a satire on the London stage that named every prominent actor of the day unfavourably, except David Garrick; the brilliant and immediate success of this poem brought recognition and money to the bankrupt parson, and Churchill launched himself on the town and indulged his profligate tastes. By June 1762 he was separated from his wife.
