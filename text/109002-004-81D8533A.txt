Sam Zell, byname of Samuel Zell, originally Zielonka  (born September 28, 1941, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American commercial real-estate entrepreneur.
Zell was the son of Polish émigrés who had circled more than half the globe before settling in the American Midwest, where Zell’s father entered the wholesale jewelry business and invested in Chicago-area real estate. While studying at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (B.A., 1963; J.D., 1966), Zell began purchasing and leasing properties to other college students. He met Robert Lurie, an engineering student who became Zell’s business partner, an association that lasted until Lurie’s death in 1990. While Zell worked (1966–68) as an attorney in Ann Arbor, the two friends managed apartment buildings in southeastern Michigan. In 1968 Zell returned to Chicago, and within two years Lurie followed him there.
