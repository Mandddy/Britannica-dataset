Luigi Cherubini, in full Maria Luigi Carlo Zenobio Salvatore Cherubini   (born Sept. 14, 1760, Florence [Italy]—died  March 15, 1842, Paris, France) Italian-born French composer during the period of transition from Classicism to Romanticism; he contributed to the development of French opera and was also a master of sacred music. His mature operas are characterized by the way they use some of the new techniques and subject matter of the Romantics but derive their dramatic force from a Classical dignity and restraint.
The son of a musician, Cherubini studied under Giuseppi Sarti, noted composer of opera and religious music. The bulk of Cherubini’s early work consists of sacred music, but he later turned most of his attention to the musical stage, writing 15 Italian and 14 French operas. In 1786 he settled in France, and in 1795 he became an inspector of the newly established Paris Conservatory. He found little favour with Napoleon, but with the restoration of the French monarchy in 1816 he became music director of the royal chapel of Louis XVIII. In 1822 he was made director of the Conservatory, a position that gave him great influence over the younger generation of composers.
