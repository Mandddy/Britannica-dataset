Walter Hasenclever,  (born July 8, 1890, Aachen, Ger.â€”died  June 21, 1940, Les Milles, France) German Expressionist poet and dramatist whose work is a protest against bourgeois materialism and the war-making state.
After studying briefly at the Universities of Oxford and Lausanne, Hasenclever in 1909 went to the University of Leipzig, where he turned to literature, philosophy, and history. While serving in the German army during World War I, he feigned mental illness and was discharged. After the war he became interested in mysticism, occultism, and Buddhism. He worked from 1924 to 1928 in Paris as correspondent for a Berlin newspaper, and from 1929 to 1932 he was a scriptwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, living in Berlin but traveling frequently throughout Europe and North Africa. After fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, he eventually went to southern France, where in 1940, confined in an internment camp, he committed suicide.
