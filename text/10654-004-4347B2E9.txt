John Jewel,  (born May 24, 1522, Buden, Devon, England—died September 23, 1571, Monkton Farleigh, Wiltshire) Anglican bishop of Salisbury and controversialist who defended Queen Elizabeth I’s religious policies opposing Roman Catholicism. The works Jewel produced during the 1560s defined and clarified points of difference between the churches of England and Rome, thus strengthening the ability of Anglicanism to survive as a permanent institution.
During the reign of the Protestant king Edward VI (1547–53), Jewel was influenced by the work of the Italian scholar and Reformer Peter Martyr Vermigli to become a leader of the Reformers in England. For self-protection Jewel signed a set of anti-Protestant statements on the accession of the Roman Catholic queen Mary I (1553), who repealed laws establishing Protestantism in England. Finding it prudent to flee the country, he traveled throughout Europe, visiting Zürich, Padua, and Strasbourg, where he met Vermigli.
