Saab was incorporated in 1937 as Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget. The company was engaged primarily in the production of aircraft until the mid-1940s, when it began manufacturing automobiles. In 1965 its name was changed to Saab Aktiebolag (AB). Saab merged with Scania-Varbis, a truck maker, to form Saab-Scania AB in 1969. The company was best known for its manufacture of Saab automobiles and Scania trucks and buses, which were exported throughout the world. It also manufactured Scania diesel engines for marine and industrial use, and other products included missiles, aviation electronics, computer systems, medical equipment, control and instrument systems, and power-plant equipment, including valves, boilers, and pipe systems. In 1990 Saab’s automotive division was restructured into an independent company, Saab Automobile AB; in 2000 it became solely owned by General Motors (GM).
