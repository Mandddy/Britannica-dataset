Playboy, American monthly magazine for men, the first to feature female nudity and sexually oriented material in a sophisticated format. Famous for its photo features, the magazine combines nude photography with topical general articles and fiction that are both frequently of high quality. Its interviews with celebrities and other newsworthy persons have won wide attention. The periodical, founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, emphasizes progressive sexual views. The “Playboy philosophy” it enunciates supports the view that men should maintain complete freedom in all things, including sex. It has had a significant influence on the sexual mores of the young American middle-class male and in format and approach has been widely imitated.
