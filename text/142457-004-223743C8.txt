David Brinkley, in full David McClure Brinkley  (born July 10, 1920, Wilmington, N.C., U.S.—died June 11, 2003, Houston, Texas)  American television reporter known for anchoring several long-running, influential news programs. Together with Walter Cronkite, Brinkley became one of America’s most well-known and beloved news personalities.
Brinkley enjoyed writing as a boy, and in high school he obtained an internship at a local newspaper. His first story—according to his memoirs, about the nonappearance of a bloom on a century plant and the crowd it drew—was picked up by the Associated Press (AP) and printed in newspapers across the country. During World War II Brinkley moved to Atlanta to write news stories for United Press International (UPI), and he was soon transferred to Nashville to become a bureau manager. On a mistaken notion that he had been offered a UPI job in Washington, D.C., Brinkley moved to that city in 1943. Finding no job waiting for him, he quickly found alternative employment as a reporter for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) radio network.
