Triton, largest of Neptune’s moons, whose unusual orbital characteristics suggest that it formed elsewhere in the solar system and was later captured by Neptune. It was discovered by the English astronomer William Lassell in October 1846, only a few weeks after the discovery of Neptune itself. Triton was named after a merman in Greek mythology who was the son of the sea god Poseidon (the Roman god Neptune).
Triton is unique among the large moons of the solar system in that it moves in a retrograde orbit—i.e., one that is opposite the direction of Neptune’s rotation. Its mean orbital distance is about 354,800 km (220,500 miles) from the planet. Also unusual for a large moon is Triton’s orbital inclination—the plane of its orbit is tilted more than 157° to Neptune’s equator. Triton rotates once on its axis every 5.877 days, which is the same time that it takes to revolve around Neptune. As a result of this synchronous rotation, the moon always keeps the same face toward Neptune and leads with the same face in its orbit. Each of Triton’s seasons, like those of Neptune, lasts nearly 41 years, or one-fourth of Neptune’s orbital period. Triton’s orbital tilt and its axial tilt of 30° with respect to Neptune’s orbit combine in such a way that the moon’s poles alternately point toward the Sun, much like the case of Uranus.Moons of Neptune         name mean distance from centre of Neptune (orbital radius; km) orbital period (sidereal period; Earth days)* inclination of orbit to planet’s equator (degrees) eccentricity of orbit   Naiad 48,227 0.2944&nbsp;R 4.75 0.0004   Thalassa 50,075 0.3115&nbsp;R 0.21 0.0002   Despina 52,526 0.3347&nbsp;R 0.22 0.0002   Galatea 61,953 0.4287&nbsp;R 0.05 0   Larissa 73,548 0.5548&nbsp;R 0.25 0.0014   Proteus 117,647 1.1223&nbsp;R 0.52 0.0005   Triton 354,800 5.8768&nbsp;R 157.3 0   Nereid 5,513,400 360.1468&nbsp;R 32.6 0.7512   Halimede 15,728,000 1,879.71&nbsp;R 134.1 0.5711   Sao 22,422,000 2,914.07&nbsp;R 48.5 0.2931   Laomedeia 23,571,000 3,167.85&nbsp;R 35 0.4237   Psamathe 46,695,000 9,115.91&nbsp;R 146.6 0.4499   Neso 48,387,000 9,373.99&nbsp;R 132 0.4945   &nbsp;   name rotation period (Earth days)** radius or radial dimensions (km) mass (1020 kg)*** mean density (g/cm3)   Naiad likely sync. 48&nbsp;×&nbsp;30&nbsp;×&nbsp;26 (0.002)    Thalassa likely sync. 54&nbsp;×&nbsp;50&nbsp;×&nbsp;26 (0.004)    Despina likely sync. 90&nbsp;×&nbsp;74&nbsp;×&nbsp;64 (0.02)    Galatea likely sync. 102&nbsp;×&nbsp;92&nbsp;×&nbsp;72 (0.04)    Larissa likely sync. 108&nbsp;×&nbsp;102&nbsp;×&nbsp;84 (0.05)    Proteus likely sync. 220&nbsp;×&nbsp;208&nbsp;×&nbsp;202 (0.5)    Triton sync. 1,353.40 214 2.061   Nereid not sync. 170 (0.3)    Halimede  31 (0.001)    Sao  22 (0.001)    Laomedeia  21 (0.001)    Psamathe  20 (0.0002)    Neso  30 (0.001)       *R following the quantity indicates a retrograde orbit. **Sync. = synchronous rotation; the rotation and orbital periods are the same. ***Mass values in parentheses are poorly known.
