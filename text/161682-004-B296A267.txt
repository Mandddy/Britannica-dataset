Jules and Jim, French Jules et Jim,  French film, released in 1962, that is the definitive New Wave movie by director François Truffaut. It epitomizes the type of groundbreaking cinema that originated in Europe during the postwar years through the 1960s.
The simple tale concerns a love triangle involving three young people in prewar Paris. Jules (played by Oskar Werner) and his best friend Jim (Henri Serre) are hopelessly smitten with Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a free-spirited, beautiful young woman who prides herself on defying society’s idea of conventional behaviour. Although she marries Jules, over the years their love affair expands to include Jim as well—though both men realize soon enough that Catherine is a high-maintenance woman and that she may indeed be quite mad.
