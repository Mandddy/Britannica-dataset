Carlos Chávez, in full Carlos Antonio de Padua Chávez y Ramírez   (born June 13, 1899, Mexico City, Mex.—died  Aug. 2, 1978, Mexico City) Mexican conductor and composer whose music combines elements of traditional folk songs and modern compositional techniques.
At age 16 Chávez completed Sinfonía, his first symphony. The ballet El fuego nuevo (1921; “The New Fire”) was his first significant work in a Mexican style. He traveled in Europe and the United States, and in 1928 he founded and became conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of Mexico. From 1928 to early 1933 (and again for part of 1934) he was director of the national conservatory in Mexico.
