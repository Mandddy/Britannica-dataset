Schmidt telescope, also called Schmidt camera ,  telescope in which a spherical primary mirror receives light that has passed through a thin aspherical lens, called a correcting plate, that compensates for the image distortions—namely, spherical aberrations—produced by the mirror. The Schmidt telescope is thus a catadioptric telescope; i.e., its optics involve both the reflection and refraction of light. Because the Schmidt telescope uses a spherical collecting mirror instead of a paraboloidal one (as conventional reflecting telescopes do), it is free from astigmatism and so has a wide field of view. The Schmidt instrument can, in effect, provide a sharper image of a larger area of the celestial sphere than ordinary reflectors and is thus ideal for star surveys.
The device was invented in 1930 by optician Bernhard Schmidt of the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg. The Schmidt-Maksutov telescope, invented by Russian optician Dmitry D. Maksutov in 1941, is similar in design and purpose to the Schmidt telescope but has a spherical meniscus, a lens in which one side is concave and the other is convex, in place of the correcting plate of the Schmidt.
