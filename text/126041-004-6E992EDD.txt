Beguines,  women in the cities of northern Europe who, beginning in the Middle Ages, led lives of religious devotion without joining an approved religious order.
So-called “holy women” (Latin: mulieres sanctae, or mulieres religiosae) first appeared in Liège toward the end of the 12th century. Use of the word “Beguine” (Latin: beguina) was established by the 1230s. Its etymology is uncertain; it seems to have originated as a pejorative term. By the mid-13th century the movement had spread throughout the Low Countries, Germany, and northern France.
