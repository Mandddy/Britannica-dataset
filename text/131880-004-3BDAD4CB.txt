Polyomavirus (family Polyomaviridae), any of a subgroup of minute oncogenic DNA viruses of the family Polyomaviridae.
The virus was first isolated in 1953 when the murine polyomavirus was discovered to have caused tumours in laboratory mice. Since then the virus has been found in a wide variety of vertebrates, from green monkeys and baboons to cage birds (notably those of the parrot family, Psittacidae) and cows. Two rare human polyomaviruses were isolated in 1971 and are known as BK virus and JC virus. Infection with BK virus may cause mild respiratory disease, whereas infection with JC virus can affect the respiratory system, the kidneys, or the brain. JC virus is responsible for causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PMLE) in immunocompromised people.
