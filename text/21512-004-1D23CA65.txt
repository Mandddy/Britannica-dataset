Ruth St. Denis, original name Ruth Dennis  (born January 20, 1879, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.—died July 21, 1968, Los Angeles, California) American contemporary dance innovator who influenced almost every phase of American dance.
From an early age Ruth Dennis displayed a marked interest in the theatre and especially in dance. She began dancing and acting in vaudeville and musical comedy shows when she was a teenager, and she appeared in David Belasco’s productions of Zaza, The Auctioneer, and Du Barry. While touring in the last play she was reputedly inspired by a cigarette poster featuring an Egyptian scene of the goddess Isis to begin investigating Asian art and dance.
