Ass, also called wild ass ,  either of two species belonging to the horse family, Equidae, especially the African wild ass (Equus africanus) sometimes referred to as the true ass. The related Asiatic wild ass, sometimes called the Asian wild ass or the half-ass (E. hemionus), is usually known by the local names of its various races: e.g., kulan (E. hemionus kulan, Mongolia) and khur (E. hemionus khur, India and Pakistan). The Syrian wild ass (E. hemionus hemippus) is extinct. The donkey (E. asinus) is a domesticated descendant of E. africanus.
Asses are small, sturdy animals, ranging from 90 to 150 cm (3 to 5 feet) high at the shoulder. The African wild ass is bluish gray to fawn; the Asiatic wild ass, lighter in colour, is reddish to yellow-gray. Both have whitish muzzles and underparts, short, dark, erect manes lacking a forelock, and tufted tails. Most asses have a dark stripe from the mane back onto the tail, but only the Nubian ass (E. africanus africanus) regularly has a prominent stripe across the shoulders, as does the donkey. The Asiatic wild ass differs from the African wild ass in its extremely long, slender legs, shorter ears (intermediate between those of the horse and donkey), and larger hooves. The bray of the Asiatic wild ass lacks the alternating low tones heard in the “hee-haw” of the African wild ass. The ass is a swift runner: kulans have been clocked at 64.4 km(40 miles) per hour. In ancient times Asiatic wild asses, especially the onager, were tamed and trained for work. These lighter-bodied animals were eventually rejected in favour of the sturdier donkey.
