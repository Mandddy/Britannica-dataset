Li Tieguai, Wade-Giles romanization Li Tâ€™ieh-kuai,  in Chinese religion, one of the Baxian, the Eight Immortals. He was an ascetic for 40 years, often foregoing food and sleep, until Laozi (also surnamed Li) agreed to return to earth and instruct his fellow clansman on worldly vanities. Returning one day from a celestial visit to his master, Li found his earthly body had been cremated by a disciple to whom it had been entrusted. He thereupon assumed a new identity by entering the deformed body of a beggar who had died of hunger. Li is thus depicted in art as an old man with an iron crutch (tieguai) and often a gourd slung over his shoulder or held in his hand. The gourd served as a bedroom for the night and held medicine, which Li dispensed with great beneficence to the poor and needy.
