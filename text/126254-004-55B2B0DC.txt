Fog signal,  sound or light signal emitted in fog or mist by lighthouses and buoys to indicate a shoreline, channel, or dangerous stretch of water and by vessels to indicate their position. Each signal has a distinctive code. All vessels, whether stationary or moving, are required by law to utilize fog signals in inclement weather; the type, number, length, and timing of the signal indicate the size of the vessel and its position. The nature and application of fog warnings is codified in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (commonly called International Rules of the Road), applicable to all international waters. The earliest sound signals were made by bells, gongs, and explosives; these largely have been replaced by foghorns powered by compressed air or electricity. See also lighthouse.
