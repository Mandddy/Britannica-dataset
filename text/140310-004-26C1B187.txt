Prague Zoological Garden, also called Prague Zoo, Czech Zoologicka Zahrada Praha,  zoological garden 4 km (2.5 miles) from downtown Prague, noted for breeding the rare Przewalski’s horse. This municipal zoo, opened in 1931, occupies 45 hectares (111 acres) and houses more than 2,300 specimens of about 465 species. Besides serving as a conservation centre for the Przewalski’s horse, it has a strong collection of Asiatic animals; South American and Australian species are also well represented. Notable breeding success has been achieved with maned wolves, two-toed sloths, cheetahs, and kulan, a species of endangered Asiatic wild ass.
The zoo attempts to create a parklike setting, and there are few major buildings aside from those for elephants, carnivores, primates, and small mammals. Otherwise, the rocky, steep grounds of the zoo are exploited. The rare markhor and goral, for example, are exhibited on cliff faces similar to those of their native mountains. A chair lift is used to carry visitors from the lower zoo grounds to the paddocks on the upper slopes.
