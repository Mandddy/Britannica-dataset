Mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), a member of the pigeon order Columbiformes, the common wild pigeon of North America having a long pointed tail and violet and pink on the sides of the neck. This game bird may live up to 16 years in captivity; however, most mourning doves live only 4 or 5 years in the wild. First-year mortality is about 80 percent. These doves migrate south in the winter; the most northward-living ones migrate the farthest south.
