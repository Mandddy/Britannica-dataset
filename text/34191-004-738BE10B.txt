Boris Alekseyevich Golitsyn,  (born July 30 [July 20, old style], 1654—died  Nov. 8 [Oct. 28, O.S.], 1714) Russian statesman who played a major role during the early years of the reign of Peter I the Great (ruled 1682–1725).
A nobleman whose clan descended from the 14th-century Lithuanian grand duke Gediminas, Golitsyn became a court chamberlain (1676) and Peter’s tutor. Although Peter’s half-sister, the regent Sophia Alekseyevna (ruled 1682–89), favoured him with an appointment as head of the government department that administered the lower Volga region, his political sympathies lay with Peter and his family, the Naryshkins.
