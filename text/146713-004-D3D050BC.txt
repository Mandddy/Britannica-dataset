Hadrian’s Villa, Italian Villa Adriana,  country residence built (c. 125–134 ce) at Tivoli near Rome by the emperor Hadrian. This villa is considered the epitome in architecture of the opulence and elegance of the Roman world. Covering approximately 7 square miles (18 square km), the complex was more an imperial garden city than a traditional villa. Its buildings were designed to follow the natural lay of the land and included baths and bath buildings, libraries, sculpture gardens, theatres, alfresco dining halls, pavilions, and private suites. Significant portions of the complex have survived to modern times. Hadrian’s Villa was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999. It was proclaimed “a masterpiece that uniquely brings together the highest expressions of the material cultures of the Mediterranean world.”
