Endodontics, in dentistry, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the dental pulp and the surrounding tissues. (The dental pulp is soft tissue in the centre of the tooth; it contains the nerve, blood and lymphatic vessels, and connective tissue.)
The practice of endodontics is concerned primarily with the removal of diseased dental pulp and its replacement with filling material, an operation known as root canal therapy. After the pulp is removed, the tooth continues to be nourished by connecting blood vessels in the jaw. The tooth is then considered to be dead, although the fibres that hold the teeth in the jawbone are alive.
