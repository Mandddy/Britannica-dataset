Complutense University of Madrid, original name University of Alcalá de Henares, Spanish Universidad Complutense de Madrid,  institution of higher learning founded in 1508 in Alcalá de Henares, Spain. Complutense means “native to Complutum,” the ancient Roman settlement at the site of Alcalá de Henares. The university moved in 1836 to Madrid, where it became known as Central University. In 1970 it adopted the name Complutense University of Madrid.
Founded by Francisco Cardinal Jiménez de Cisneros as an instrument in the intellectual reform of the church, the school opened in 1508, following its recognition by papal bull. The university taught Thomist, Scotist, and Nominalist theology and Oriental languages and attracted many outstanding scholars who cooperated in the production of the famous Complutensian Polyglot Bible (completed in 1517 and published about 1522). The Colegio de Maria de Aragon was added to the university in 1590. It now embraces several other institutions, including the Medical College of San Carlos, the Royal Institute of San Isidro, a technical college that was added in 1966, and a Jesuit school of philosophy.
