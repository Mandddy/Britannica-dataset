Mazda Motor Corporation, formerly (1927–84) Tōyō Kōgyō Company,  Japanese automotive manufacturer, maker of Mazda passenger cars, trucks, and buses. The company is affiliated with the Sumitomo group. It is headquartered at Hiroshima.
Founded in 1920 as a cork plant, the company acquired its Tōyō Kōgyō name in 1927. In 1931 it began manufacturing its first vehicles, a line of three-wheel trucks, producing some 200,000 in the next 25 years. During World War II it provided the Japanese armed forces with these trucks as well as with rifles. The company’s factory survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima because it lay shielded behind a hill.
