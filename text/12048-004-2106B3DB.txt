Paul Ernst, in full Paul Karl Friedrich Ernst   (born March 7, 1866, Elbingerode, Saxony [Germany]—died  May 13, 1933, Sankt Georgen, Austria) German writer known particularly for his short stories and for essays on philosophical, economic, and literary problems.
Ernst studied for the ministry but quickly became disillusioned with theology. He became a militant Marxist and the editor of the Berliner Volkstribüne. He severed his Marxist connections at the turn of the century, however, and repudiated the doctrine in Der Zusammenbruch des Marxismus (1919; “The Collapse of Marxism”). He had already expressed his antagonism toward naturalism in art and called for a return to classicism in his essay Der Weg zur Form (1906; “The Road to Form”). His search for eternal truths led him through German idealist philosophy back to a form of Christianity that he dramatized in what he called redemption drama, best exemplified by Ariadne auf Naxos (1912).
