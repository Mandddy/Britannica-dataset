Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet,  (born March 8, 1788, Glasgow, Scot.—died  May 6, 1856, Edinburgh) Scottish metaphysical philosopher and influential educator, also remembered for his contributions in the field of logic.
Hamilton took his B.A. from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1811 and became a member of the Scottish bar in 1813. He inherited a baronetcy in 1816 (after a court suit), and in 1821 he was appointed professor of civil history at the University of Edinburgh. A versatile teacher, he was also knowledgeable in anatomy, physiology, literature, and theology and was a frequent contributor to journals. His long friendship with the French philosopher Victor Cousin originated with his essay in the Edinburgh Review on “The Philosophy of the Unconditioned” (1829), a critique of Cousin’s Cours de philosophie. Hamilton’s subsequent articles on German philosophy in the Edinburgh Review established his reputation as a philosopher, and he was elected to the chair of logic and metaphysics at Edinburgh in 1836.
