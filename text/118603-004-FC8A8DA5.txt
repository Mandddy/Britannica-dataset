Dewberry, any of several species of trailing blackberries of the genus Rubus in the rose family (Rosaceae). Dewberries are found throughout North America and northern Europe. They bear edible fruits that can be eaten raw or baked into cobblers or pies or made into preserves. They are occasionally cultivated but can spread rapidly and are considered to be weeds in many areas.
Dewberry plants are low-growing perennials and are often heavily armed with prickles. The leaves are palmately compound, usually with three to five toothed leaflets, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Arching stems that touch the ground often sprout roots at the tip, allowing the plant to spread vegetatively. Unlike most other brambles, the plants are frequently dioecious, meaning individuals are either male or female. The flowers are usually white with five petals and feature numerous stamens or pistils, depending on the sex. The delicate fruit is not a true berry but rather an aggregate of druplets and ripens to purple or black.
