Yitzhak Zuckerman, also spelled Itzhak Zuckerman or Yitzhak Cukierman, byname Antek  (born 1915, Warsaw, Pol.â€”died  June 17, 1981, Tel Aviv, Isr.) hero of Jewish resistance to the Nazis in World War II and one of the few survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.
Zuckerman was active in a federation of young Zionist organizations, Hehalutz, and early favoured armed resistance to Nazi depredations against the Jews. He was quick to interpret the first mass executions of Jews as the beginning of a systematic program of annihilation. Perceiving the full scope of Nazi plans and realizing that they had nothing left to lose, Zuckerman and resistance leaders such as Abba Kovner and Mordecai Anielewicz found the determination to resist and to risk their lives.
