SpaceShipOne (SS1), the first private manned space vehicle, which flew past the boundary of space (100,000 metres, or 328,000 feet) over the United States in 2004 in competition for the Ansari X Prize. Inspired by the Orteig Prize won by Charles Lindbergh for his solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927, which was sponsored by American hotel owner Raymond Orteig, the $10 million Ansari X Prize was sponsored by Iranian-born American entrepreneurs Anousheh and Amir Ansari and was offered to the first private enterprise that successfully completed two piloted flights with the equivalent weight of two passengers to the boundary of space in a two-week period. Having won the prize, SS1 now hangs in the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., a monument to the future of space tourism.
With financing from Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, SS1 was designed and developed by Scaled Composites of Mojave, Calif., an aerospace development company founded by American aircraft designer Burt Rutan in 1982. The space vehicle was part of a broader program known as Tier One, which was made up of SS1, a launch aircraft called White Knight (WK), a hybrid rocket engine system using rubber and liquid nitrous oxide as the fuels, and an avionics suite. Scaled Composites had previously developed dozens of unique composite material aircraft.
