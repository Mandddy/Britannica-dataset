Mary Pickford, original name Gladys Mary Smith  (born April 9, 1893, Toronto, Ont., Can.—died May 28, 1979, Santa Monica, Calif., U.S.) Canadian-born U.S. motion-picture actress, “America’s sweetheart” of the silent screen, and one of the first film stars. At the height of her career, she was one of the richest and most famous women in the United States.
Gladys Mary Smith was the daughter of actors. Soon after the death of her father she began taking child’s roles in productions in which her mother was playing. She made her first stage appearance in a Toronto stock company at the age of five. At eight she went on tour, and within 10 years she was playing on Broadway. From 1906 the family adopted the name Pickford. She made her New York debut in David Belasco’s The Warrens of Virginia in December 1907. At age 14 she had already learned more of stagecraft than many older actors, and her winsome face, framed by a mass of golden curls, made her appeal virtually irresistible.
