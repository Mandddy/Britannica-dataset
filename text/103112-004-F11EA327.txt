Dominique de Villepin, in full Dominique-Marie-François-René Galouzeau de Villepin  (born November 14, 1953, Rabat, Morocco) French diplomat, politician, and writer who served as interior minister (2004–05) and prime minister (2005–07) in the neo-Gaullist administration of Pres. Jacques Chirac.
De Villepin was born into an influential family; his father represented French industry abroad before securing a seat in the French Senate. The younger de Villepin eventually passed through France’s elite École Nationale d’Administration and into the Foreign Ministry in 1980. His career there led to posts in Africa, Washington, D.C., and India, before he finally accepted an appointment as the top adviser to Foreign Minister Alain Juppé in 1993–95. After Chirac, de Villepin’s political mentor, won the presidency in 1995, de Villepin became secretary-general of the Élysée Palace and played a key role in many decisions, including the premature dissolution of the National Assembly in 1997. The move, however, backfired when the conservatives lost rather than increased their majority.
