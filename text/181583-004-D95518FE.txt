Mike Nichols, original name in full Michael Igor Peschkowsky   (born November 6, 1931, Berlin, Germany—died November 19, 2014, New York, New York, U.S.) American motion-picture, television, and stage director whose productions focus on the absurdities and horrors of modern life as revealed in personal relationships.
At age seven, Nichols emigrated with his family from Germany to the United States, before the outbreak of World War II. He attended the University of Chicago (1950–53), studied acting under Lee Strasberg in New York City, and then returned to Chicago, where, with Elaine May, Shelley Berman, Barbara Harris, and Paul Sills, he formed the comic improvisational group The Compass Players. Nichols and May then traveled nationwide with their social-satire routines, and from 1960 to 1961 they performed on Broadway in An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May. The recording of their show won Nichols and May a Grammy Award for best comedy album of the year.
