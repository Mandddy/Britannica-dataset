Irene Ducas,  (born c. 1066, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]â€”died Feb. 19, 1123 [or 1133], Constantinople) wife of the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus, known from the description of her in the Alexiad of their daughter, Anna Comnena.
When Alexius became emperor in April 1081 he reportedly planned to repudiate Irene and wed Mary, who had been married to the former emperors Michael VII Ducas and Nicephorus III Botaneiates. It was probably fortunate for Alexius that his plan was foiled, for his repudiation of his wife would have incurred the enmity of the powerful Ducas family. Irene was crowned on April 11, 1081, seven days after her husband.
