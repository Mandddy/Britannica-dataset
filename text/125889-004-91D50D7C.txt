Smorgasbord, Swedish Smörgåsbord,  in Swedish cuisine, buffet offering a variety of fish, cheeses, and hot and cold dishes. In the country districts of Sweden, it was customary for guests to contribute to the fare at large gatherings. The foods were set out on long tables from which the diners helped themselves. By the 18th century, festive meals were preceded by appetizers from a bannvinsbord, offering aquavit, herring, and other delicacies.
A modern smorgasbord may be a simple appetizer table offering the essential bread, butter, cheese, and pickled and marinated herring, or an elaborate display of scores of hot and cold dishes, including herring prepared a dozen ways, pâtés, cold meats, and salads, and Swedish specialties such as gravlax (marinated salmon), meatballs, and “Jansson’s temptation,” a casserole of potatoes, onions, anchovies, and cream.
