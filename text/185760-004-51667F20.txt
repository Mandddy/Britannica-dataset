Eva Hesse,  (born January 11, 1936, Hamburg, Germany—died May 29, 1970, New York, New York, U.S.) German-born American painter and sculptor known for using unusual materials such as rubber tubing, fibreglass, synthetic resins, cord, cloth, and wire. Hesse had a prolific yet short career, and her influence since her death at age 34 has been widespread.
Born into a German Jewish family, Hesse was about three years old when her parents left their extended family behind and fled the Nazi regime, arriving in New York City in 1939. Her parents divorced in 1945, and her mother committed suicide a year later. Despite her traumatic and tragic early life, Hesse was an accomplished student. As an adolescent, she already wanted to pursue art, and she attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design). She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn (from September 1952 to December 1953), Cooper Union (1954–57), and the School of Art and Architecture at Yale University (B.F.A., 1959), where she studied with artist Josef Albers. After she graduated, Hesse returned to New York City and supported her art by working as a pattern designer for a textile company. In 1961 Hesse exhibited her work for the first time in a show titled “Drawings: Three Young Americans” at the John Heller Gallery. She met and married sculptor Tom Doyle that year. Hesse’s first solo exhibition, a show of her drawings, was held in 1963 at the Allan Stone Gallery in New York City.
