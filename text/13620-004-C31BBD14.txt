Yaacov Agam, original name Jacob Gipstein   (born May 11, 1928, Rishon le-Zion, Palestine [now Rishon LeẔiyyon, Israel]) pioneer and leading exponent of optical and kinetic art, best known for his three-dimensional paintings and sculptures.
Agam was the son of a Russian rabbi. He grew up in an early Jewish settlement and did not begin his formal schooling until age 13. Having learned to draw at an early age, he studied art in Jerusalem (1947–48), Zürich (1949–51), and Paris (1951) and had his first one-man exhibition in 1953 in Paris, where he settled. Eventually his body of work grew to include vibrating and tactile elements, and he began to create manipulable sculptures as well.
