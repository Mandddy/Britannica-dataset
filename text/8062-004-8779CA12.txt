Herrerasaurus (genus Herrerasaurus), primitive carnivorous dinosaur or close relative of dinosaurs found as fossils in Argentine deposits from the Late Triassic Period (228.7 million to 199.6 million years ago). It had long, powerful hind legs for running and short forelimbs equipped with three recurved claws for grasping and raking. The lower jaw possessed large inward-curving teeth and was flexible for holding prey. Herrerasaurus reached a length of about 3 metres (10 feet) and weighed about 180 kg (400 pounds).
Herrerasaurus flourished at a time just before dinosaurs became the dominant land animals. Its remains help clarify the sequence of anatomic changes that occurred during early dinosaur evolution. It closely resembled the common ancestor of all dinosaurs, and it retained the carnivorous habits and features of predatory animals that were ancestral to dinosaurs and their relatives. Although some features, such as their three-toed feet, resemble those of true theropod dinosaurs, they lack some features that distinguish theropods from saurischians, such as overlapping wrist bones and an opposable thumb.
