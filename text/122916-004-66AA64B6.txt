Gulf, any large coastal indentation. More specifically, such a feature is the reentrant of an ocean, regardless of size, depth, configuration, and geologic structure. The nomenclature for gulfs is far from uniform; names that may refer to sizable gulfs in various places include bay, bight, firth, sound, and fjord. In addition, a number of pronounced concavities of oceanic margins have no proper name at all. As such, many of the characteristics of gulfs may also apply to bays and other similar geographies.
This problem of nomenclature extends to the difference between gulfs and seas. There are many small seas, such as the Sea of Marmara (11,000 square km [about 4,200 square miles]) and the Sea of Azov (38,000 square km [about 14,700 square miles]), which, strictly speaking, are really gulfs of the ocean or other seas (the Sea of Azov is a gulf of the Black Sea). The Gulf of Aden (about 270,000 square km [about 104,000 square miles]), another example, is part of the Arabian Sea, and these water bodies have a common regime (similar tides, precipitation, evaporation, and so forth). The narrow sound of Bab el-Mandeb connects the gulf with the vast Red Sea (438,100 square km [about 169,000 square miles]) and exhibits a number of specific geomorphic features. The Red Sea in turn has two small gulfs to the northâ€”namely, those of Suez and Aqaba.
