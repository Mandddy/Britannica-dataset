Robin Milner, in full Arthur John Robin Gorell Milner  (born Jan. 13, 1934, Yealmpton, Devon, Eng.—died March 20, 2010, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) English computer scientist and winner of the 1991 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for his work with automatic theorem provers, the ML computer programming language, and a general theory of concurrency.
Milner attended Eton College and won a scholarship to attend the University of Cambridge in 1952, but he had to postpone his course work while he served at the Suez Canal with the Royal Engineers of the British army for the next two years. Milner entered Cambridge in 1954 and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1957. He was first exposed to computing in the summer of 1956 with a short course in programming in which he used the school’s EDSAC computer. After that, Milner moved to London, where he held various jobs, including a post teaching mathematics at Marylebone Grammar School (1959–60), before he became a computer programmer and developed compilers at Ferranti Ltd. (Ferranti produced the first commercial computer, the Ferranti Mark I, in 1951.)
