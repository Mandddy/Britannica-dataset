Karl Leberecht Immermann,  (born April 24, 1796, Magdeburg, Saxony—died  Aug. 25, 1840, Düsseldorf, Prussia) dramatist and novelist whose works included two forerunners in German literary history: Die Epigonen as a novel of the contemporary social scene and Der Oberhof as a realistic story of village life.
The son of a civil servant, Immermann interrupted his legal studies in Halle (1813–17) to fight in the last phase of the Napoleonic Wars. While working in the military court in Münster (1819–24), he fell in love with Elisa von Lützow, the wife of the Prussian general Adolf, Freiherr von Lützow. Their passionate love affair ended 14 years after the Lützow divorce (1825) because Elisa unwaveringly refused to enter upon a second marriage. At the beginning of 1824, Immermann became judge in the criminal court at Magdeburg, moving to the provincial court at Düsseldorf three years later. In Düsseldorf he designed and built a “model” theatre where, in accordance with Goethe’s theories, he especially cultivated ensemble. In 1839 Immermann was married to the 20-year-old Marianne Niemeyer, and the new life and new happiness that his marriage gave him found expression in his epic Tristan und Isolde, which was left unfinished at his death.
