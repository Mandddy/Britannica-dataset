Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, baron de l’Aulne,  (born , May 10, 1727, Paris, France—died March 18, 1781, Paris) French economist who was an administrator under Louis XV and served as the comptroller general of finance (1774–76) under Louis XVI. His efforts at instituting financial reform were blocked by the privileged classes.
Turgot was born into an old Norman family whose members had already held some important administrative posts. (His father, Michel-Étienne [1690–1751], was to be “provost of merchants,” the head of the Paris municipality, from 1729 to 1740.) Destined for the church, he entered the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice (1743) and the Sorbonne (1749), exhibiting both as a schoolboy and as an advanced student a precocious but sound maturity of intellect. He was influenced from his adolescence by all the fashionable ideas of his day: scientific curiosity, liberalism, tolerance, and an interest in social evolution. In 1751, on the threshold of ordination, he drew back, explaining to his relatives that it would have been impossible for him always to have lived under false pretenses, being, in fact, a deist. His occasional attendance at mass was necessitated by his rank.
