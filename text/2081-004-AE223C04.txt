Wilhelm Lehmbruck,  (born January 4, 1881, Meiderich, near Duisburg, Germany—died March 25, 1919, Berlin) German sculptor, printmaker, and painter best known for his melancholy sculptures of elongated nudes.
Lehmbruck studied art in Düsseldorf, Germany, first at the School of Arts and Crafts (1895–1901) and then at the Art Academy (1901–07). His early work was academic and conservative; he was strongly influenced by the monumental works of the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, as seen in Lehmbruck’s The Bather (1905) and his life-sized Mankind (1909).
