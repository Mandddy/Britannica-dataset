Charles Weidman, in full Charles Edward Weidman, Jr.  (born July 22, 1901, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.—died  July 15, 1975, New York, New York) major innovator of American modern dance, noted for the abstract, rhythmic pantomime he developed and employed in his comic and satiric works.
Weidman became interested in dance after seeing Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn perform, and after studying with Elinor Frampton in Lincoln he joined them and became a leading Denishawn dancer, excelling in such popular character roles as the crapshooter in Shawn’s Danse américaine. In the late 1920s he left Denishawn and with Doris Humphrey founded the Humphrey-Weidman school and company, which endured until 1945. During their association he occasionally aided Humphrey in her pure-movement choreography, notably the trilogy New Dance (1936), and often performed in her dances; characterization and pantomime, however, remained his main interest.
