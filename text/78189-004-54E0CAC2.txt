Mariology, in Christian, especially Roman Catholic, theology, the study of doctrines concerning Mary, the mother of Jesus; the term also refers to the content of these doctrines.
The primary methodological problem of Mariology lies in the very limited mention of Mary made in the New Testament and in the relative, although not complete, silence about Mary in the early church. Although Mary is mentioned in some early apocryphal (noncanonical) writings and baptismal creeds, theological disputes were the most significant factor in bringing Mary to theological prominence. At various times, it was denied both that Jesus was authentically human and that he was fully divine. To the first charge, the assertion that he had a human mother was considered a convincing refutation; with regard to the second, the affirmation by the Council of Ephesus (431) that Mary was Theotokos became the principle upon which devotion to Mary in the East has primarily rested. In both Eastern and Western liturgical traditions, various feast days in her honour were established.
