Marin Alsop,  (born Oct. 16, 1956, New York, N.Y., U.S.) American conductor who, as the musical director of the Baltimore (Md.) Symphony Orchestra (2007– ), was the first woman to lead a major American orchestra.
Alsop was the daughter of musicians and studied piano and violin as a child. By age nine, when she heard Leonard Bernstein lead the New York Philharmonic, she knew that she wanted to be a conductor. She entered Yale University in 1972 but in 1975 transferred to the Juilliard School in New York City, where she received bachelor’s (1977) and master’s (1978) degrees in violin performance. While working as a freelance violinist in New York City, she began to study conducting in 1979. Alsop formed the jazz group String Fever (1981) and the Concordia Orchestra (1984), which performed everything from jazz to contemporary works.
