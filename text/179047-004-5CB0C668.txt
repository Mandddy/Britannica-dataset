Saturn, Latin Saturnus,  in Roman religion, the god of sowing or seed. The Romans equated him with the Greek agricultural deity Cronus. The remains of Saturn’s temple at Rome, eight columns of the pronaos (porch), still dominate the west end of the Forum at the foot of the Clivus Capitolinus. The temple goes back to the earliest records of the republic (6th century bce). It was restored by Lucius Munatius Plancus in 42 bce and, after a fire, in the 4th century ce. It served as the treasury (aerarium Saturni) of the Roman state. Saturn’s cult partner was the obscure goddess Lua, whose name is connected with lues (plague or destruction), but he was also associated with Ops, another obscure goddess (perhaps the goddess of abundance), the cult partner of Consus, probably a god of grain storage.
In Roman myth Saturn was identified with the Greek Cronus. Exiled from Olympus by Zeus, he ruled Latium in a happy and innocent golden age, where he taught his people agriculture and other peaceful arts. In myth he was the father of Picus.
