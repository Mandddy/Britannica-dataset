Ludvík Svoboda,  (born Nov. 25, 1895, Hroznatín, Moravia, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]—died  Sept. 20, 1979, Prague, Czech.) president of Czechoslovakia (1968–75) who achieved great popularity by resisting the Soviet Union’s demands during and after its invasion of August 1968. He was also a national hero of two world wars.
Deserting from the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I, Svoboda fought in the Czechoslovak legion in Russia. After the war he rose in the ranks of the Czechoslovak army. He was in charge of a battalion at the time of the Munich crisis (1938), which resulted in the occupation by Germany of large parts of Czechoslovakia. After the German seizure in March 1939 of what was left of his country, Svoboda went underground. He organized Czechoslovak refugee units in Poland, and, when that country fell during World War II, he moved to the Soviet Union as head of the Czechoslovak army corps. After Czechoslovakia’s liberation in 1945, he was appointed minister of defense by President Edvard Beneš. A Communist sympathizer, Svoboda did nothing to prevent the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948.
