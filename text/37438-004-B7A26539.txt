Leopold I, French in full Léopold-Georges-Chrétien-Frédéric, Dutch in full Leopold George Christiaan Frederik  (born Dec. 16, 1790, Coburg, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld [Germany]—died Dec. 10, 1865, Laeken, Belg.) first king of the Belgians (1831–65), who helped strengthen the nation’s new parliamentary system and, as a leading figure in European diplomacy, scrupulously maintained Belgian neutrality.
The fourth son of Francis, duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Leopold served with the allies against Napoleon’s forces during the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15); in 1816 he married Charlotte, the only child of the future king George IV of Great Britain. Although the princess died in 1817, Leopold continued to live in England until 1831, when he accepted his election as king of the Belgians, having declined the Greek crown the previous year. He immediately began to strengthen the Belgian army and, with assistance from France and England, fought off the attacks of William I of the Netherlands, who refused until 1839 to recognize Belgium as an independent kingdom.
