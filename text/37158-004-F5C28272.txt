Nicephorus III Botaneiates , Nicephorus also spelled Nikephoros  (born c. 1001—died c. 1081) Byzantine emperor (1078–81) whose use of Turkish support in acquiring and holding the throne tightened the grip of the Seljuq Turks on Anatolia.
Nicephorus, who belonged to the military aristocracy of Asia Minor and who was related to the powerful Phocas family, became commander of the Anatolian theme (administrative district). When discontent against the government of Michael VII Ducas led to rioting in Constantinople, Nicephorus was proclaimed emperor (January 7, 1078) by his supporters there. With some support from Suleiman, the Seljuq ruler in Anatolia, Nicephorus was acclaimed emperor by his troops at Nicaea (in northwestern Anatolia) and entered Constantinople three months later. His imperial claim was ratified by the aristocracy and clergy, who had already deposed Michael VII. Nicephorus III defeated a rival claimant to the throne, Nicephorus Bryennius, the empire’s commander in Albania; he also defeated a later pretender, Nicephorus Basilacius, who succeeded Bryennius in Albania.
