Special Olympics, international program to provide individuals with intellectual disabilities who are eight years of age or older with year-round sports training and athletic competition in more than 20 Olympic-type summer and winter sports. Inaugurated in 1968, the Special Olympics was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee on Feb. 15, 1988. International headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
In June 1962 with support from the Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation, Eunice Kennedy Shriver (sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy) started a summer day-camp for mentally challenged children at her home in Rockville, Md. The Kennedy foundation subsequently promoted the creation of dozens of similar camps in the United States and Canada, special awards were developed for physical achievements, and by 1968 Shriver had persuaded the Chicago Park District to join with the Kennedy foundation in sponsoring a “Special Olympics,” held at Soldier Field on July 19–20. About 1,000 athletes from 26 U.S. states and Canada participated. The games were such a success that Special Olympics, Inc. (now Special Olympics International) was founded in December, with chapters in the United States, Canada, and France. The first Special Olympics World Winter Games were held on Feb. 5–11, 1977 (in Steamboat Springs, Colo.). By the early 21st century there were chapters in nearly 200 countries. More than one million athletes participate annually in some 20,000 meets and tournaments held worldwide, culminating in the international Special Olympics World Games every two years, alternating between winter and summer sports and each lasting for nine days.
