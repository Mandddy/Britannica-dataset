Roberto Benigni,  (born October 27, 1952, Misericordia, Arezzo, Italy) Italian actor and director known for his comedic work, most notably La vita è bella (1997; Life Is Beautiful), for which he won an Academy Award for best actor.
Benigni was the son of a poor tenant farmer who had worked in a German labour camp during World War II. The elder Benigni used humour in retelling his experiences, which helped shape his son’s comedic skill. Benigni briefly attended a Jesuit seminary in Florence, and, after a stint as a magician’s assistant, he joined an underground theatre group in the late 1960s. There he cowrote a semiautobiographical monologue that led to a tour of Italy and the film Berlinguer, ti voglio bene (1977; Berlinguer: I Love You). A string of movies followed, and in 1983 he made his directorial debut with Tu mi turbi (You Upset Me), which he also wrote and starred in. The film featured his wife, actress Nicoletta Braschi, who frequently appeared in his work and played his onscreen spouse in Life Is Beautiful. Benigni again performed triple duties in Il piccolo diavolo (1988; “The Little Devil”) and Il mostro (1994; The Monster). His fourth film as director, writer, and actor, Johnny Stecchino (1991), a Mafia farce, set box-office records in Italy.
