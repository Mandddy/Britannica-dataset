Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky, Stanislavsky also spelled Stanislavski, original name Konstantin Sergeyevich Alekseyev  (born January 5 [January 17, New Style], 1863, Moscow, Russia—died August 7, 1938, Moscow) Russian actor, director, and producer, founder of the Moscow Art Theatre (opened 1898). He is best known for developing the system or theory of acting called the Stanislavsky system, or Stanislavsky method.
Stanislavsky’s father was a manufacturer, and his mother was the daughter of a French actress. Stanislavsky first appeared on his parents’ amateur stage at age 14 and subsequently joined the dramatic group that was organized by his family and called the Alekseyev Circle. Although initially an awkward performer, Stanislavsky obsessively worked on his shortcomings of voice, diction, and body movement. His thoroughness and his preoccupation with all aspects of a production came to distinguish him from other members of the Alekseyev Circle, and he gradually became its central figure. Stanislavsky also performed in other groups as theatre came to absorb his life. He adopted the pseudonym Stanislavsky in 1885, and in 1888 he married Maria Perevoshchikova, a schoolteacher, who became his devoted disciple and lifelong companion, as well as an outstanding actress under the name Lilina.
