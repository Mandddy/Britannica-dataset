Red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called lesser panda, panda, red cat-bear, or red bear-cat,  reddish brown, long-tailed, raccoonlike mammal, about the size of a large domestic cat, that is found in the mountain forests of the Himalayas and adjacent areas of eastern Asia and subsists mainly on bamboo and other vegetation, fruits, and insects. Once classified as a relative of the giant panda, it is now usually classified as the sole member of the family Ailuridae.
The red panda has soft thick fur—rich reddish brown above and black underneath. The face is white, with a stripe of red-brown from each eye to the corners of the mouth, and the bushy tail is faintly ringed. The head and body length of the red panda is 50–65 cm (20–26 inches) and the tail 30–50 cm (12–20 inches) long, and the weight ranges from 3 to 6.2 kg (6.5 to 14 pounds). The feet have hairy soles, and the claws are semi-retractile.
