Stratford Canning, Viscount Stratford,  (born Nov. 4, 1786, London, Eng.—died  Aug. 14, 1880, Frant, Sussex) diplomat who represented Great Britain at the Ottoman court for almost 20 years intermittently between 1810 and 1858, exerting a strong influence on Turkish policy.
Stratford Canning was a cousin of George Canning, British foreign secretary (1807–09, 1822–27) and prime minister (1827), and, through the latter’s aid, was educated at Eton College and at King’s College, Cambridge. George Canning first enlisted him in the foreign service in 1807. As chargé d’affaires and de facto ambassador at Constantinople (1810–12), Stratford Canning helped to arrange the Treaty of Bucharest (May 28, 1812) between Turkey and Russia, thereby freeing Russian troops to resist a French invasion force led by Napoleon I. As minister to Switzerland (1814–18), he introduced a plan for a perpetually neutral Swiss confederation, which was approved (March 20, 1815) by the Congress of Vienna. He then served (1820–23) as minister to the United States.
