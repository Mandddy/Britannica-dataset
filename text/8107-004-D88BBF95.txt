Cocker spaniel, either of two breeds of sporting dogs used by hunters to flush game birds from cover; it is also trained to retrieve. “Cocker” likely refers to its use in flushing woodcocks. Spaniel ancestors have been known since the 14th century, gradually differentiated into land, water, and toy breeds. The cockers are the smallest of the hunting spaniels (the toy spaniels are companion dogs). The cocker spaniel was given breed status in England in 1883 and registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1878. The English cocker spaniel was separated from the American by the AKC in 1946.
The American cocker spaniel is a small dog standing 14 to 15 inches (36 to 38 cm) and weighing 22 to 29 pounds (10 to 13 kg). Compact and sturdily built, it has a rounded head, floppy ears, and a soft, flat or wavy coat. The tail is usually docked. The coat may be either solid coloured or variegated; colours include black and black with tan, reddish brown, buff, and black and white. The English cocker spaniel is similar to the American cocker spaniel but is larger and has longer legs and a longer muzzle. It stands 15 to 17 inches (38 to 43 cm) and weighs 26 to 34 pounds (12 to 15 kg). It has a medium-length, silky coat in a variety of colours. Cocker spaniels are popular companion dogs and are especially good with children.
