Lotte Lenya, original name Karoline Blamauer   (born October 18, 1898, Vienna, Austria—died November 27, 1981, New York, New York, U.S.) Austrian actress-singer who popularized much of the music of her first husband, the composer Kurt Weill, and appeared frequently in the musical dramas of Weill and his longtime collaborator Bertolt Brecht.
Lenya studied ballet and drama in Zurich from 1914 to 1920, was a member of the corps de ballet at the Zürich Stadttheater, and played in Shakespeare in Berlin in the 1920s. She married Weill in 1926 and appeared in the controversial Brecht–Weill work Mahagonny (“Little Mahagonny”) at the Baden-Baden Festival in 1927. She alternated in the roles of Jenny and Lucy in Die Dreigroschenoper (1928; “The Threepenny Opera”) and starred in other Weill vehicles, among them a full-length operatic version of Mahagonny, entitled Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (1930; “The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny”).
