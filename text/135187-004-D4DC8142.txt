Glenn Beck,  (born February 10, 1964, Mount Vernon, Washington, U.S.) American conservative political commentator and television and radio personality, perhaps best known for hosting the talk show Glenn Beck (2009â€“11) on the Fox News Channel (FNC).
Beck grew up in Mount Vernon, Washington, where his father owned a bakery. He developed a fascination with radio at a young age, and he won an hour-long disc-jockey debut on a local station when he was 13. His parents divorced later that year, and he moved with his mother to Puyallup, Washington. His mother, who had battled depression and substance abuse, died in a boating accident in 1979; Beck would later characterize her death as a suicide. Beck returned to live with his father, and by age 15 he had a job at a radio station in Seattle. He later worked at stations in Provo, Utah; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Louisville, Kentucky.
