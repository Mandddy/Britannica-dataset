Buffalo weaver,  either of the two African birds constituting the subfamily Bubalornithinae of the family Ploceidae. The more widespread species is the black buffalo weaver, or oxbird (Bubalornis albirostris); it is black, with white in the wings. The white-headed buffalo weaver (Dinemellia dinemelli), confined to eastern Africa, is brown and white, with red rump and vent. Both are stout-bodied, heavy-billed birds 20–25 cm (8–10 inches) long. In breeding season the male’s bill becomes whitish and swollen at the base. Buffalo weavers live in dry regions, where they forage omnivorously on the ground in small noisy flocks, often in the wake of buffalo herds. The nest, a heap of thorny twigs, contains compartments for two or more pairs; several nests may occupy the same tree.
