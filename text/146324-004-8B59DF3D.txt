Everett McKinley Dirksen,  (born Jan. 4, 1896, Pekin, Ill., U.S.—died  Sept. 7, 1969, Washington, D.C.) U.S. politician and leader of the Senate Republicans during the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
Dirksen attended the University of Minnesota, left before graduating to serve in World War I, and, after his discharge, returned to Pekin, where he pursued a number of business interests. In 1926, with his election to the office of city finance commissioner in Pekin, Dirksen began what was to become a lifelong career in public service. Defeated in 1930 in his bid for a congressional seat, he ran again in 1932 and won. A conservative Republican, Dirksen voted against most New Deal measures—except Social Security. He also opposed Roosevelt’s foreign policy, adhering to an isolationist stance. In a foreshadowing of his later moderation and flexibility, however, Dirksen switched to bipartisan support of presidential foreign policy with U.S. entry into World War II.
