Kaliningrad, formerly German (1255–1946) Königsberg, Polish Królewiec,  city, seaport, and administrative centre of Kaliningrad oblast (region), Russia. Detached from the rest of the country, the city is an exclave of the Russian federation. Kaliningrad lies on the Pregolya River just upstream from Frisches Lagoon. Formerly the capital of the dukes of Prussia and later the capital of East Prussia, the city was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1945 under the Potsdam agreement.
The old town of Königsberg (“King’s Mountain”) grew up around the fortress built in 1255 by the Teutonic Knights on the advice of Přemysl Otakar II, king of Bohemia, after whom the place was named. Its first site was near the fishing town of Steindamm, but, after its destruction by the Prussians in 1263, it was rebuilt near where the city now stands. Königsberg received civic privileges in 1286 and entered the Hanseatic League in 1340. From 1457 it was the residence of the grand master of the Teutonic Knights, and from 1525 until 1618 the residence of the dukes of Prussia. The trade of Königsberg was much hindered by the constant shifting and silting up of the channels leading to its harbour, and the First Northern War and the Second Northern War did the city immense damage, but before the end of the 17th century it had almost recovered. In 1701, in the chapel of the castle, Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg crowned himself the first king of Prussia—as Frederick I. In 1724 Frederick William I of Prussia united nearby Löbenicht and Kneiphof with Königsberg to form a single city.
