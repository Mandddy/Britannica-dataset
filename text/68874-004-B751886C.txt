Sir John Herschel, 1st Baronet, in full Sir John Frederick William Herschel, 1st Baronet  (born March 7, 1792, Slough, Buckinghamshire, England—died May 11, 1871, Collingwood, Kent) English astronomer and successor to his father, Sir William Herschel, in the field of stellar and nebular observation and discovery.
An only child, John was educated briefly at Eton and then privately. In 1809 he entered the University of Cambridge in the company of Charles Babbage, mathematician and inventor of the computer, and George Peacock, also a mathematician and later a theologian. In 1812 they founded the Analytical Society of Cambridge to introduce continental methods of mathematical calculus into English practice. They did so by replacing the cumbersome symbolism of Newton with the more efficient type invented by the German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. John’s exceptional abilities were quickly recognized: in 1812 he submitted his first mathematical paper to the Royal Society, for which he was elected a fellow the following year. In 1813 he earned first place in the university mathematical examinations.
