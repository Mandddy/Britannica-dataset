Fennec (Fennecus zerda), desert-dwelling fox, family Canidae, found in north Africa and the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas. The fennec is characterized by its small size (head and body length 36–41 cm [14–16 inches], weight about 1.5 kg [3.3 pounds]) and large ears (15 cm or more in length). It has long, thick, whitish to sand-coloured fur and a black-tipped tail 18–31 cm long. Mainly nocturnal, the fennec spends the heat of the day underground in its burrow. It feeds on insects, small animals, and fruit. Its litters of two to five young are born after a gestation period of about 51 days.
The name fennec is sometimes erroneously applied to the South African silver fox and to Ruppell’s fox (see fox).
