John Catron,  (born 1786?, Wythe County, Va.?, U.S.—died  May 30, 1865, Nashville, Tenn.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1837–65).
After moving from Kentucky to Tennessee in 1812 and serving under General Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812, Catron studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1815. Until 1818 he practiced on a “mountain circuit” in Tennessee and became its prosecuting attorney. He became highly versed in the land law, then the major source of litigation, and built up a lucrative practice in Nashville. In 1824 the state Supreme Court of Last Resort (later called the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals) was enlarged, and Catron was elected to it by the legislature. In his most famous decision on this court he disbarred a lawyer for duelling and denounced the practice. In 1831, in a judicial reorganization, Catron became Tennessee’s first chief justice.
