Glacier National Park, scenic wilderness area in the northern Rocky Mountains in northwestern Montana, U.S., adjoining the Canadian border and Canadaâ€™s Waterton Lakes National Park. The two parks together comprise Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park, dedicated in 1932. Glacier National Park straddles the Continental Divide, the great ridge of the Rocky Mountains marking the boundary between westward (to the Pacific Ocean) and eastward (to Hudson Bay and the Mississippi River) drainage systems. It was classified as a UNESCO International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, and the international peace park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995.
Glacier National Park, established in 1910, encompasses 1,583 square miles (4,101 square km), a third of which is above the timberline. It is bordered to the west and southwest by the Flathead River and Flathead National Forest, to the southeast by Lewis and Clark National Forest, and to the east by the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. Salish and later Blackfoot Indians once inhabited the area now contained within the park. Although new settlers, pushing ever westward with the railroad in the 1800s and early 1900s, were primarily interested in making a living from the land, appreciation also grew for its natural beauty. Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, tourist facilities began to be established. The Great Northern Railway (whose rail line ran along the southern border of the park) built numerous hotels and small lodges (called chalets) throughout the park, most of which were accessible only by hiking or horseback; only a handful of them are still in use.
