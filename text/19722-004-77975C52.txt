Kraków, also spelled Cracow ,  city and capital of Małopolskie województwo (province), southern Poland, lying on both sides of the upper Vistula River. One of the largest cities in Poland, it is known primarily for its grand historic architecture and cultural leadership; UNESCO designated its old town area a World Heritage site in 1978. Its marketplace, Rynek Główny (Main Square), has existed since the 13th century, and a modern landscaped area is laid out on the site of past fortifications.
Kraków was the home of the Wiślanie tribe (Vistulans), who occupied Małopolska (Little Poland) until the 10th century. From 988 to 990 Mieszko I, prince of Poland, united the southern and northern territories to form a powerful kingdom, and his son, Bolesław I (the Brave), later made Kraków the seat of a Polish bishopric. The city expanded rapidly as a trade centre, becoming the capital of one of Poland’s major principalities in 1138. It was devastated by Tatar invasions during the 13th century but was quickly rebuilt, receiving “Magdeburg rights,” which consisted of a municipal constitution, in 1257.
