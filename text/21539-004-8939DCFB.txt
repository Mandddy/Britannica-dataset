Adelina Patti, original name Adela Juana Maria Patti  (born Feb. 19, 1843, Madrid, Spain—died Sept. 27, 1919, Craig-y-Nos Castle, Brecknockshire, Wales) Italian soprano who was one of the great coloratura singers of the 19th century.
Patti was the daughter of two singers—Salvatore Patti, a tenor, and Caterina Chiesa Barilli-Patti, a soprano. As a child she went to the United States, and she appeared in concerts in New York City from age seven. After spending several years touring North and South America and the West Indies, in November 1859 she made her operatic debut as Lucia in Gaetano Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor at the New York Academy of Music. Two years later she traveled to London, where her debut as Amina in Vincenzo Bellini’s La sonnambula was a sensation. For the next 23 years she was a Covent Garden regular. She sang many roles in the operas of Bellini, Gioachino Rossini, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Charles Gounod, among others, as well as in several of the early operas of Giuseppe Verdi.
