Sir Peter Jackson, in full Sir Peter Robert Jackson  (born October 31, 1961, Pukerua Bay, North Island, New Zealand) New Zealand director, perhaps best known for his film adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkienâ€™s The Lord of the Rings.
When Jackson was eight years old, his parents bought an 8-mm movie camera, and he began making short films. He later purchased a used 16-mm camera and, with his friends, began work on what started out to be another short film. It kept growing, however, and, with the aid of a grant from the New Zealand Film Commission, Bad Taste was released in 1987. The comedy-horror movie won acclaim at the Cannes film festival and went on to become a cult favourite.
