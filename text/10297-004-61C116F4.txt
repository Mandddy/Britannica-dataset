Last Supper, also called Lord’s Supper,  in the New Testament (Matthew 26:17–29; Mark 14:12–25; Luke 22:7–38; I Corinthians 11:23–25), the final meal shared by Jesus and his disciples in an upper room in Jerusalem, the occasion of the institution of the Eucharist. According to the biblical account, Jesus sent two of his disciples to prepare for the meal and met with all the disciples in the upper room. He told them that one of them would betray him. After blessing bread and wine and giving it to them to eat and drink, Jesus told them that it was his body and his blood of the Covenant.
The Synoptic Gospels and the early traditions of the church affirm that the Last Supper occurred on the Passover. Although the account of the Crucifixion in the Gospel According to John indicates that the Last Supper could not have been a Passover meal, many interpreters accept the account given in the Synoptic Gospels. Two aspects of the Last Supper have been traditionally depicted in Christian art: Christ’s revelation to his Apostles that one of them will betray him and their reaction to this announcement, and the institution of the sacrament of the Eucharist with the communion of the Apostles. Early Christian art (c. 2nd–c. 6th century) stressed neither aspect of the Last Supper to the exclusion of the other, but thereafter the East generally favoured compositions emphasizing the symbolic aspects of the event, and the West favoured those emphasizing the narrative.
