Rio Grande, Spanish Río Grande del Norte or (in Mexico) Río Bravo or Río Bravo del Norte ,  fifth longest river of North America, and the 20th longest in the world, forming the border between the U.S. state of Texas and Mexico. Rising as a clear, snow-fed mountain stream more than 12,000 feet (3,700 metres) above sea level in the Rocky Mountains, the Rio Grande descends across steppes and deserts, watering rich agricultural regions as it flows on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. The total length of the river is about 1,900 miles (3,060 km).
The area within the entire watershed of the Rio Grande is some 336,000 square miles (870,000 square km). Because a large proportion of the river’s basin is arid or semiarid, however, only about half of the total area, or about 176,000 square miles (456,000 square km), actually contributes to the river’s flow.
