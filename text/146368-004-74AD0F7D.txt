Tapir (genus Tapirus), any of five species of hoofed mammals, the only extant members of the family Tapiridae (order Perissodactyla), found in tropical forests of Malaysia and the New World. Heavy-bodied and rather short-legged, tapirs are 1.3 to 2.5 metres (about 4 to 8 feet) long and reach about 1 metre at the shoulder. The eyes are small, the ears are short and rounded, and the snout extends into a short fleshy proboscis, or trunk, that hangs down over the upper lip. The feet have three functional toes, the first (inner) toe being absent and the fifth toe being reduced in front and absent in the hind foot. Body hair is short and usually sparse but is fairly dense in the mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque, formerly T. roulini). There is a short, bristly mane in the Central American, or Bairdâ€™s, tapir (T. bairdii), the little black, or Kobomani, tapir (T. kabomani), and the South American lowland tapir (T. terrestris). This geographic distribution, with four species in Central and South America and one in Southeast Asia, is peculiar. Fossil remains from Europe, China, and North America show that tapirs were once widespread, but the extinction of intermediate forms has isolated the living species.
The four New World species are black, plain dark brown, or gray, but the Malayan tapir (T. indicus) is strongly patterned, with black head, shoulders, and legs and white rump, back, and belly. The young of all tapirs are dark brown, streaked and spotted with yellowish white. A single young (rarely two) is produced after a gestation of about 400 days.
