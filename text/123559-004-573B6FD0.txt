Österreichische Gallery,  art museum established in Belvedere Castle, Vienna, in 1903. The museum includes many works of art that had been in the imperial Austrian private collection. The gallery is organized into three principal divisions: the Austrian Baroque Museum; the Austrian Gallery of the 19th and 20th Centuries; and the Museum of Medieval Austrian Art.
Beginning in 1957 the gallery issued a yearbook, Mitteilungen der österreichischen Galerie (“Announcements of the Austrian Gallery”). Special exhibits of Austrian and international interest and focus, including collections of the works of Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Paul Cézanne, and others, became features of the gallery’s program after World War II.
