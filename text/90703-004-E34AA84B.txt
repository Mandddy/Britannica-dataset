To Be or Not to Be, American screwball comedy film, released in 1942, that was Carole Lombard’s last film. Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, it is set in German-occupied Warsaw during World War II. The film’s comedic skewering of Nazis was particularly controversial at a time when the war was ongoing.
Lombard and Jack Benny portrayed a married couple who are the leading players in a Warsaw-based company of hammy Shakespearean actors, out of work following the Nazi invasion of Poland. They find a patriotic use for their costumes and acting abilities, however, when they become embroiled in a complicated plot to prevent a double agent from delivering vital information to the Nazis.
