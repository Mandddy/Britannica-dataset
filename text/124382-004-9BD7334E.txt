Primary school,  in many countries, an elementary school. It is the preferred term in such countries as Great Britain and France (French école primaire) and in most publications of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. In the United States it is not a synonym but denotes only the first years of elementary education—specifically, kindergarten and grades 1 through 3.
