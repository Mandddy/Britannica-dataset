Hose,  flexible piping designed to carry liquids or gases. Early hoses were made from leather, which was never wholly satisfactory and was supplanted in the 19th century by natural rubber. Rubber layered on a pole or mandrel produced a flexible and watertight hose; the addition of canvas strengthened the fabric, and helically wound wire gave a degree of rigidity. The introduction of the extrusion process for rubber made possible hoses of any length and enormously increased their usefulness. For vulcanization of a layered hose, a lead sheath is applied; after vulcanization in an autoclave (pressure boiler) the sheath is stripped off.
World War II stimulated the development of numerous synthetic rubbers with greater chemical resistance. The development of polyethylene opened a new field. Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, provided another versatile material for hose makers. The discovery of polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE, produced a plastic with outstanding resistance to most chemicals. Methods have also been developed for producing flexible metal hose and combinations of metal and synthetic fibres, e.g., a Dacron and stainless-steel hose capable of carrying liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, and other ultralow-temperature liquids.
