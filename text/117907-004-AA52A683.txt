Santa Fe, county, a scenic area of northern New Mexico, U.S. The northeastern portion is in the Sangre de Cristo range of the Southern Rocky Mountains, featuring Santa Fe Baldy and Lake Peak, both more than 12,000 feet (3,650 metres) in elevation. At the mountains’ southern end is Glorieta Mesa, an area of hilly, grassy plains in the Basin and Range Province, with a landscape marked by colourful hills, mesas, and isolated mountains. The Rio Grande, which passes through the county’s far northwest, and several small, tributary streams are the principal bodies of water. Santa Fe National Forest, Pecos Wilderness, Hyde Memorial and Santa Fe River state parks, and the San Ildefonso, Nambe, Pojoaque, Tesuque, and Santo Domingo Pueblo Indian reservations are all located in the county.
Pueblos were built in the region from at least the beginning of the 14th century. Spanish settlement commenced in 1610 at Santa Fe; the 1680 Pueblo Revolt against Spanish rule began at Tesuque pueblo. The development of Santa Fe as the capital of Spain’s vast New Mexico territory dominated the area’s history. The county was established by Mexico in 1844, and in 1852 it was reestablished as one of the first counties in New Mexico Territory, U.S. The Battle of Glorieta Pass, a decisive blow to Confederate hopes during the American Civil War, was fought in Santa Fe county.
