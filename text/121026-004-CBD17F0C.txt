Man o’ War, byname Big Red,  (foaled 1917), American racehorse (Thoroughbred) often considered the greatest of the 20th century. In a brief career of only two seasons (1919–20), he won 20 of 21 races, established seven track records for speed over various distances, and raced at odds as short as 1–100. In 1920 he won the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, but his owner refused to run him in the Kentucky Derby, denying Man o’ War the opportunity to win what would later become known as the American Triple Crown.
Man o’ War was foaled on March 29, 1917, at the Nursery Stud farm near Lexington, Kentucky. His sire, Fair Play, was considered the best stallion on the farm, and his dam, Mahubah, was the daughter of Rock Sand, winner of the 1903 British Triple Crown. There were high hopes for the colt.
