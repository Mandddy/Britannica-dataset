Clement XIII, original name Carlo della Torre Rezzonico   (born March 7, 1693, Venice—died  Feb. 2, 1769, Rome) pope from 1758 to 1769.
In 1716 Rezzonico, who had studied under the Jesuits in Bologna, was ordained and appointed governor of Rieti, in the Papal States, becoming governor of Fano in 1721. He then served numerous church offices and was made cardinal by Pope Clement XII in 1737. On July 6, 1758, he was elected pope at a time when anti-Romanism amid European princes was revealed most explicitly in the Bourbons’ plan to destroy the Society of Jesus, then at the peak of its influence. Concurrently, the anti-Roman movement received further impetus from the spread of Febronianism, a German doctrine claiming to restrict papal power and akin to its French counterpart, Gallicanism. In 1764 Clement condemned Febronianism and on May 21 promulgated a brief that commanded all German bishops to suppress it. The papal condemnation met with a mixed reception, however.
