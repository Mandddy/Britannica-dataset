Ninotchka, American romantic comedy film, released in 1939, that featured Greta Garbo in a rare nondramatic role and was marketed with the tagline “Garbo Laughs!”
The comedy stars Garbo as Ninotchka, a stern, committed communist functionary sent to Paris to rein in diplomats sent there to sell imperial jewels confiscated during the Russian Revolution of 1917. The most amusing scenes find Ninotchka reluctant to admit her blossoming feelings for a dashing count (played by Melvyn Douglas) and the latter’s increasingly successful attempts to get Ninotchka to laugh (Garbo herself was infamous for her serious demeanour). Ninotchka eventually grows to like the West and its capitalist ways.
