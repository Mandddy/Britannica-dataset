John Frederic Daniell,  (born March 12, 1790, London, Eng.—died March 13, 1845, London) British chemist and meteorologist who invented the Daniell cell, which was a great improvement over the voltaic cell used in the early days of battery development.
In 1820 Daniell invented a dew-point hygrometer (a device that indicates atmospheric humidity), which came into widespread use. In his Meteorological Essays and Observations (1823), Daniell revealed his findings on the behaviour of the atmosphere and on trade winds, in addition to giving details of improved meteorological equipment. In a later edition he also discussed the meteorological effects of solar radiation and the cooling of the Earth. Daniell’s Essay on Artificial Climate Considered in Its Applications to Horticulture showed the importance of humidity in greenhouses.
