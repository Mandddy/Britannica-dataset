Bill Robinson, byname Bojangles, original name Luther Robinson  (born May 25, 1878, Richmond, Va., U.S.—died Nov. 25, 1949, New York, N.Y.) American dancer of Broadway and Hollywood, best known for his dancing roles with Shirley Temple in films of the 1930s.
Robinson’s parents having died when he was a baby, he was raised by a grandmother and received little formal schooling. He began dancing for pennies at the age of eight, when he had also begun to work as a stableboy. He eventually made a swing of a vaudeville circuit and in 1908 entered a business association with Marty Forkins, actors’ agent, who helped him to fame.
