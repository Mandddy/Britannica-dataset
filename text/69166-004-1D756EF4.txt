Julius Erving, in full Julius Winfield Erving II, byname Doctor J  (born Feb. 22, 1950, Roosevelt, N.Y., U.S.) American collegiate and professional basketball player who was one of the most colourful and exciting figures in the game during the 1970s and ’80s. At 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 metres), Erving played forward and was noted for his fast breaks, balletic leaps toward the basket, and climactic slam dunks.
While playing in high school, Erving won an athletic scholarship to the University of Massachusetts. In two seasons there he became one of only five players ever to average more than 20 points and 20 rebounds per game in a collegiate career. He was still generally unknown, however, when he left Massachusetts after his junior year and joined the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1971. He was traded to the New York Nets two years later. In his five seasons in the ABA, Erving led the league in scoring three times, was the league’s Most Valuable Player in its last three years, and led the Nets to championships in 1974 and 1976.
