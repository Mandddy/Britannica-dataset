Early Netherlandish art, also called Early Flemish art,  sculpture, painting, architecture, and other visual arts created in the several domains that in the late 14th and 15th centuries were under the rule of the dukes of Burgundy, coincidentally counts of Flanders. As the terms “Burgundian” and “Flemish” describe only parts of the phenomenon, neither can posit for the whole.
In 1363 John II of France titled his son Philip, surnamed the Bold, duke of Burgundy. By marriage to the heiress of Flanders, Philip added to his duchy, on the death of his father-in-law in 1384, the countship of Flanders. The formidable Flemish–Burgundian alliance remained intact until 1482, when Philip the Bold’s great-granddaughter Mary of Burgundy died.
