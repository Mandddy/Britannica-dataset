Sir David Lean,  (born March 25, 1908, Croydon, Surrey, Eng.â€”died April 16, 1991, London) British film director whose literate, epic productions featured spectacular cinematography and stunning locales.
Lean was the son of strict Quaker parents and did not see his first film until age 17. He began his film career in 1928 as a teaboy for Gaumont-British studios, where he soon was promoted to clapboard boy, and finally to editor, a position at which he excelled. By the end of the 1930s Lean was the most highly-paid film editor working in British cinema and widely regarded as the best. Until the end of his career, Lean considered editing the most interesting step in the filmmaking process and always contracted with studios to cut his own films.
