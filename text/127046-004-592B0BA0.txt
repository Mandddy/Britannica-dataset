Rōnin,  any of the masterless samurai warrior aristocrats of the late Muromachi (1138–1573) and Tokugawa (1603–1867) periods who were often vagrant and disruptive and sometimes actively rebellious.
By the 12th century the term rōnin began to be used for samurai who, as a result of either losses in battle, the untimely death of their lord, or their own misdeeds, had been dispossessed of their fief and their noble sponsorship. During the tumultuous period before the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate, their numbers increased rapidly; they remained a great cause of disorder throughout the first half of the 17th century.
