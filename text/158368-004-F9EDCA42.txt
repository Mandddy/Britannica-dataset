Ramón Castilla,  (born August 27, 1797, Tarapacá, Peru—died May 25, 1867, Arica, Chile) soldier and statesman who, as president or as the power behind the scene, dominated Peruvian politics for nearly 20 years. A conservative himself, he wisely offered concessions to all sectors of Peruvian society and provided the nation with a long period of political stability and economic progress.
As a young man, he fought for the Spaniards until he was captured by the Chilean patriots. He then fought against the Spaniards in Peru, performing heroically with José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar. In the anarchy that followed the death of Pres. Agustín Gamarra in 1841, Castilla assumed power and was elected president the following year (1845). He served until 1851 and then overthrew the next president, José Rufino Echenique, in 1855, to rule until 1862.
