Nataraja, (
        Sanskrit: “Lord of the Dance”) the Hindu god Shiva in his form as the cosmic dancer, represented in metal or stone in many Shaivite temples, particularly in South India.
In the most common type of image, Shiva is shown with four arms and flying locks dancing on the figure of a dwarf, who is sometimes identified as Apasmara (a symbol of human ignorance; apasmara means “forgetfulness” or “heedlessness”). Shiva’s back right hand holds the damaru (hourglass-shaped drum); the front right hand is in the abhaya mudra (the “fear-not” gesture, made by holding the palm outward with fingers pointing up); the back left hand carries Agni (fire) in a vessel or in the palm of the hand; and the front left hand is held across his chest in the gajahasta (elephant-trunk) pose, with wrist limp and fingers pointed downward toward the uplifted left foot. The locks of Shiva’s hair stand out in several strands interspersed with flowers, a skull, a crescent moon, and the figure of Ganga (the Ganges River personified as a goddess). His figure is encircled by a ring of flames, the prabhamandala. In classic Sanskrit treatises on dance, this form, the most common representation of Nataraja, is called the bhujungatrasa (“trembling of the snake”).
