Charles James Lever,  (born Aug. 31, 1806, Dublin, Ire.—died  June 1, 1872, Trieste, Austria-Hungary [now in Italy]) Irish editor and writer whose novels, set in post-Napoleonic Ireland and Europe, featured lively, picaresque heroes.
In 1831, after study at Trinity College, Cambridge, he qualified for the practice of medicine. His gambling and extravagance, however, left him short of money despite his income and his inheritance, and he began to utilize his gifts as a raconteur. In 1837 The Confessions of Harry Lorrequer appeared serially in the Dublin University Magazine, where it was a definite success. His novel Charles O’Malley, which ranges from the west of Ireland to the Peninsular War, appeared in 1841; Jack Hinton and Tom Burke of “Ours,” a vigorous story of an Irishman in the service of the French empire, in 1843.
