José Zorrilla y Moral,  (born Feb. 21, 1817, Valladolid, Spain—died  Jan. 23, 1893, Madrid) poet and dramatist, the major figure of the nationalist wing of the Spanish Romantic movement. His work was enormously popular and is now regarded as quintessentially Spanish in style and tone.
After studying law at Toledo and Valladolid, Zorilla y Moral left the university and went to Madrid to devote himself to literature. In 1837 he became an overnight success with his recitation of an elegy at the funeral of the poet Mariano José de Larra. He ran away from his wife and financial distress and was abroad from 1855 to 1866, where he wrote prolifically but remained insolvent. In 1889 he was crowned as the national poet and was granted a government pension.
