Clarence River,  river in eastern South Island, New Zealand. Rising on the eastern slopes of the Spenser Mountains, it flows south, then northeast between the Inland and Seaward Kaikoura ranges. Cutting eastward by a gorge 7 mi (11 km) long through the Seaward Kaikoura Range, the river flows south and east, entering the Pacific Ocean 20 mi north of the town of Kaikoura. The main stream, fed by Lake Tennyson and its principal tributary, the Acheron River, is 130 mi long and drains a 1,270-sq-mi basin. The Clarence, bordered by mixed sheep and cattle runs, has a steep gradient that, in conjunction with several gorges, presents hydroelectric potential.
