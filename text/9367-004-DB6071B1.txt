Aaron Siskind,  (born December 4, 1903, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 8, 1991, Providence, Rhode Island) influential American teacher, editor, and photographer who is best known for his innovations in abstract photography.
Siskind began to photograph in 1932, while he was an English teacher in the New York City public-school system. As a member of the Photo League, he participated in projects designed to document neighbourhood life during the Depression. Unlike other documentary series of the period, Siskind’s Dead End: The Bowery and Harlem Document show as much concern for pure design as for the plight of his subjects. After the late 1930s, Siskind no longer photographed people, concentrating instead on architectural photography, as in his series Old Houses of Bucks County, and on natural phenomena and still life.
