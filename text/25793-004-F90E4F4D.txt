Pasquier Quesnel,  (born July 14, 1634, Paris, France—died  Dec. 2, 1719, Amsterdam, Neth.) controversial French theologian who led the Jansenists (followers of Bishop Cornelius Jansen’s heretical doctrines on predestination, free will, and grace) through the persecution by King Louis XIV of France until they were papally condemned.
Quesnel joined the French Oratory (a religious society of secular priests) in 1657 and was ordained in 1659. His Jansenist sympathies led to his banishment from Paris in 1681, and three years later he was expelled from the Oratory for refusing to accept the anti-Jansenist decrees it promulgated. He fled to Brussels where he lived with the exiled Antoine Arnauld, champion of the Jansenist resistance, until Arnauld’s death in 1694. In 1703 he was arrested but soon escaped to Amsterdam, where he finally settled.
