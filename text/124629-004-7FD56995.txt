Sake, also spelled saki,  Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. Sake is light in colour, is noncarbonated, has a sweet flavour, and contains up to 18 percent alcohol.
Sake is often mistakenly called a wine because of its appearance and alcoholic content; however, it is made in a two-step process similar to that for brewing beer. Special strains of rice are precisely milled to remove the outer layers, a process that reduces the grain to 50â€“70 percent of its original size. Production begins with koji, a preparation of steamed rice and Aspergillus oryzae, a mold that converts the rice starch to fermentable sugars. The koji, mixed with water and fresh steamed rice, is kneaded (traditionally by hand) into a smooth paste and placed in a vat with more rice and water. This mixture, allowed to ferment for about four weeks with sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), becomes moto, with an alcoholic content of about 11 percent. More koji, steamed rice, and water are added to the vat, and a second fermentation begins, lasting about seven days. After resting for another week, the sake is filtered, pasteurized, and bottled. Alcohol may be added to the desired level.
