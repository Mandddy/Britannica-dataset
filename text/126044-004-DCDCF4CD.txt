Saint Joseph,  (flourished 1st century ad, Nazareth, Galilee, region of Palestine; principal feast day March 19, Feast of St. Joseph the Worker May 1) in the New Testament, Jesus’ earthly father, the Virgin Mary’s husband, and in Roman Catholicism patron of the universal church. His life is recorded in the Gospels, particularly Matthew and Luke.
Joseph was a descendant of the House of King David. After marrying Mary, he found her already pregnant and, being “a just man and unwilling to put her to shame” (Matt. 1:19), decided to divorce her quietly; but an angel told him that the child was the son of God and was conceived by the Holy Ghost. Obeying the angel, Joseph took Mary as his wife. After Jesus’ birth at Bethlehem (modern Bayt Laḥm, Jordan) in Judaea, where the holy family received the Magi, an angel warned Joseph and Mary about the impending violence against the child by King Herod the Great of Judaea, whereupon they fled to Egypt. There the angel again appeared to Joseph, informing him of Herod’s death and instructing him to return to the Holy Land.
