Galvanizing, protection of iron or steel against exposure to the atmosphere and consequent rusting by application of a zinc coating. Properly applied, galvanizing may protect from atmospheric corrosion for 15 to 30 years or more. As discontinuities or porosity develop in the coating, galvanic or electrolytic action ensues; the iron or steel, however, is protected by sacrificial corrosion, a phenomenon in which, as long as the zinc and the iron are in contact, atmospheric oxidation spares the iron and affects the zinc.
Zinc may be applied by two general methods: hot dipping and electrolytic deposition.
