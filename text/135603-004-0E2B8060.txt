Alton B. Parker,  (born May 14, 1852, Cortland, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 10, 1926, New York, N.Y.) American jurist and Democratic presidential nominee in 1904, defeated by the incumbent, Theodore Roosevelt.
Having practiced law in Kingston, N.Y., Parker was elected surrogate of Ulster county in 1877 and reelected six years later. He also was active in state Democratic Party affairs. He was appointed to the New York Supreme Court in 1885, the state Appeals Court in 1889, and the appellate division of the state Supreme Court in 1896. From 1898 to 1904 Parker was chief justice of the New York Court of Appeals. On the bench, he was noted for upholding the rights of labour. Nominated on the first ballot at the Democratic convention in 1904, Parker, representing the eastern, pro–gold-standard wing of the party, differed little from his opponent, President Theodore Roosevelt. Parker was soundly defeated, taking only 38 percent of the popular vote and winning 140 electoral votes to Roosevelt’s 336. Thereafter he returned to his law practice.
