Slashdot, Web site created by Rob Malda, an American college student, in September 1997 in order to provide technology news and information. Editorials, stories, articles, and reviews are submitted by users and then either accepted or rejected by administrators. Owned by SourceForge, Inc., Slashdot hosts millions of users on a monthly basis.
Slashdot features a unique culture that stems primarily from its moderation system. Communication etiquette is enforced through a karma system: posting negative or antagonistic content results in a loss of “karma points” and a penalty, whereas positive and constructive contributions yield better karma and certain perks. However, users seeking karma points disingenuously or in an exploitative manner are subjected to the scorn of the Slashdot community. Slashdot users give content a rating, such as funny, insightful, off-topic, or overrated. Owing to Slashdot’s popularity, other Web sites featured in its stories often become so inundated with unexpected visits that their Internet servers crash. Web sites targeted and affected in such a manner are deemed “slashdotted.”
