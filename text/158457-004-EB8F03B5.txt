Bob Knight, in full Robert Montgomery Knight, also called Bobby Knight and the General  (born October 25, 1940, Massillon, Ohio, U.S.) American collegiate basketball coach whose 902 career National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) coaching victories are among the most in men’s basketball history.
Knight played basketball and football in high school, and he was a reserve on the Ohio State University national championship basketball team in 1960. After spending two years as an assistant coach at the United States Military Academy (Army), he was promoted to head coach in 1965 and became the youngest varsity basketball coach in NCAA history. Knight was an immediate success at Army because of his coaching philosophy, which stressed discipline, unselfish play, and relentless man-to-man defense. He took the head coaching job at traditional power Indiana University in 1971, and he led the Hoosiers to an appearance in the NCAA tournament’s Final Four (championship semifinals) in his second season. His 1975–76 team produced a perfect 32–0 record and won the NCAA championship. The Hoosiers also won national titles in 1981 and 1987. In 1984 Knight coached the U.S. men’s basketball team to a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
