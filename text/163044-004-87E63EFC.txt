Elizabeth Cabot Agassiz, née Elizabeth Cabot Cary   (born Dec. 5, 1822, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died  June 27, 1907, Arlington Heights, Mass.) American naturalist and educator who was the first president of Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Cary was related to many of Boston’s leading families. She received no formal schooling but acquired a somewhat haphazard education at home. In April 1850 she married the distinguished and recently widowed Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz; her work proved to be invaluable to his career. Her notes on his lectures were the raw material of much of his published work, and she helped organize and manage several of his expeditions into the field, notably the Thayer Expedition to Brazil in 1865–66 and the Hassler Expedition through the Strait of Magellan in 1871–72. Together they founded the coeducational Anderson School of Natural History, a marine laboratory on Penikese Island in Buzzard’s Bay, Massachusetts. Elizabeth Agassiz’s own published work includes A First Lesson in Natural History (1859), Seaside Studies in Natural History (1865; with her stepson Alexander Agassiz), and A Journey in Brazil (1867; with her husband).
