Moulin Rouge, British dramatic film, released in 1952, that chronicles the life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. José Ferrer’s performance as the legendary French artist was widely acclaimed.
The John Huston-directed biopic traces the life and work of Toulouse-Lautrec as he worked in the bohemian subculture of Paris in the late 19th century, especially around the burlesque hall known as the Moulin Rouge. There he sketched the dancers as they performed, painted promotional posters for the establishment, and became a pawn of cruel women whose love he craved.
