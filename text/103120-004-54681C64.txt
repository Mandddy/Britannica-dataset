Diana Ross, original name Diane Earle  (born March 26, 1944, Detroit, Mich., U.S.) American pop singer and actress who achieved international stardom, first as leader of the vocal group the Supremes and later as a solo artist.
Ross’s professional career began in 1959, when she joined several neighbourhood friends to form the pop-soul vocal group the Primettes. The group was renamed the Supremes after signing a recording contract with Motown late the following year. Consisting of Ross, Mary Wilson, and Florence Ballard (replaced in 1967 by Cindy Birdsong), the Supremes achieved 12 number one hits on the pop charts, including “Baby Love” (1964), “Stop! In the Name of Love” (1965), and “Someday We’ll Be Together” (1969). In 1967 the group was renamed Diana Ross and the Supremes, foreshadowing Ross’s solo career, which she launched in 1970.
