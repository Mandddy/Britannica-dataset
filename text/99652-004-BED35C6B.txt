Neckar River,  river, a right-bank tributary of the Rhine in southwestern Germany; it is 228 miles (367 km) long, rising in the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) near Schwenningen am Neckar, near the headwaters of the Danube River. The Neckar flows north and northeast, along the northwestern edge of the Swabian Jura (Schwäbische Alb), passing Tübingen and other small cities. At Plochingen it changes to a northwesterly course and flows through Stuttgart. As the river continues northward, its picturesque valley becomes broader and deeper, passing between vine-clad hills crowned by feudal castles. The river flows by Heilbronn to Eberbach, where it takes a tortuous westerly course, cutting through the wooded hills of the southern Odenwald. Winding by Neckarsteinach and Neckargemünd, it sweeps beneath the Königstuhl peak (1,857 feet [566 m]), passes Heidelberg, and enters the Rhine from the right at Mannheim. The Neckar is canalized as far as Plochingen and is navigable for 1,000-ton barges.
