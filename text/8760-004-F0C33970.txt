Welland Canal,  waterway in southern Ontario, Can., that provides navigation for large vessels between Lake Erie to the south and Lake Ontario to the north and forms an important link in the St. Lawrence Seaway. The canal was necessary because the Niagara River, the natural connection between Lakes Erie and Ontario, has impassable falls and rapids. The modern Welland Canal extends 27.6 miles (44.4 km) from Port Colborne (on Lake Erie) to Port Weller (on Lake Ontario) and has a minimum depth of 30 feet (9 m). The 327-foot difference in elevation between the two lakes is overcome by eight locks, which can accommodate vessels up to 230 feet long. The time required for transit of the canal is usually less than eight hours.
The first canal, opened in 1829, was 8 feet deep and connected Port Dalhousie (3 miles west of the present canalâ€™s northern outlet) with Port Robinson on Chippawa Creek, which gave access to the Niagara River. In 1833 the canal was extended southward to Port Colborne, and between 1871 and 1887 it was enlarged. Construction beginning in 1913 led to the opening of the newer canal in 1932. Further improvements in the southern part of the canal were completed in 1972.
