Saltaire, early planned industrial settlement near Bradford in Airedale, in what is now Bradford metropolitan borough, metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, historic county of Yorkshire, northern England.
It was created in 1853 by the industrialist Sir Titus Salt, a manufacturer of alpaca wool fabrics, as a model village for his employees. The community, named for its founder (Salt) and the nearby river (Aire), was built beside large woolen mills on the banks of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Its solid terraced houses remain. Shipley, an industrial and residential suburb of Bradford, is the nearest sizable present-day community. Saltaire was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001.
