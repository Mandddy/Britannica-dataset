Arundinaria, genus of bamboos and canes in the grass family (Poaceae), found in temperate areas. The plants typically grow in marshy areas or along riverbanks, and the stems can be woven into baskets and mats and are used to make pipes and fishing poles. The taxonomy of the genus is contentious, and the exact number of species and their distribution remains unresolved.
Arundinaria species are woody perennials and range in height from 0.5–8 metres (1.6–26 feet). Most species spread vegetatively with creeping rhizomes (underground stems) and can form dense colonies that exclude other plants. The cylindrical stems are characterized by persistent leaf sheaths with stiff rough bristles; the leaves are long and narrow. New stems produce a distinctive fan of leaves known as a top knot. Sexual reproduction is rare, and colonies typically die after flowering and producing seed.
