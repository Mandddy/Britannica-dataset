Desiderio da Settignano,  (born c. 1430, Settignano, republic of Florence [Italy]—died January 1464, Florence) Florentine sculptor whose works, particularly his marble low reliefs, were unrivaled in the 15th century for subtlety and technical accomplishment. He is perhaps best known for having carved the funerary monument for the humanist Carlo Marsuppini.
Desiderio was raised in a family of stone masons and entered the Stone and Wood Carvers’ Guild of Florence in 1453. Little is known about his education, although he was influenced by the Italian sculptor Donatello, particularly in his low reliefs. In his youth he worked with his brother Geri in a workshop near the Ponte Santa Trinita; his fame seems to have lasted during his lifetime and until soon after his death.
