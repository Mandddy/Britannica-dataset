Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones, 1st Baronet, original name Edward Coley Burne Jones   (born Aug. 28, 1833, Birmingham, Eng.—died  June 17, 1898, London) one of the leading painters and designers of late 19th-century England, whose romantic paintings using medieval imagery were among the last manifestations of the Pre-Raphaelite style. More long-lasting is his influence as a pioneer of the revival of the ideal of the “artist-craftsman,” so influential to the development of 20th-century industrial design.
Burne-Jones was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, where he met his future collaborator, the artist-poet William Morris, then a fellow divinity student. His meeting with the artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1856 marked a turning point in his career, and he left Oxford without graduating. Morris and he then settled in London, working under Rossetti’s guidance.
