Guenon (genus Cercopithecus), any of 26 species of widely distributed African monkeys characterized by bold markings of white or bright colours. Guenons are slim, graceful quadrupedal monkeys with long arms and legs, short faces, and nonprehensile tails that are longer than the combined head and body length of about 42–56 cm (16–22 inches). Males of the large species weigh over 7 kg (about 15 pounds) and females as much as 5 kg (11.7 pounds); individuals of the smaller species may be as light as 2.3 kg (5.1 pounds). Guenons are known for the beauty of their soft, dense fur, which in many species has a speckled appearance produced by the alternation of two colours along each hair shaft. The bodies of guenons are commonly grayish, reddish, brown, green, or yellow.
In general, these monkeys are arboreal forest dwellers; however, some species also inhabit wetlands. Most guenons live in sizable groups of females and young with a single adult male. The groups are territorial, and the males utter loud barks or chirps as spacing calls. Groups from different species will often combine for foraging, at times associating for long periods. Guenons forage for leaves, fruit, and other vegetation and possibly for insects and other small animals; several species raid crops. In some species breeding seems to occur at any time of year. Single young are born after a gestation period of approximately five to seven months, depending on the species. Numerous species can be tamed, and they are commonly seen in zoos, owing to their hardiness, activity, good nature, and habit of grimacing at observers. With good care, their life span may exceed 20–30 years.
