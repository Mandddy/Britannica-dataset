Barite, also called barytes or heavy spar,  the most common barium mineral, barium sulfate (BaSO4). Barite occurs in hydrothermal ore veins (particularly those containing lead and silver), in sedimentary rocks such as limestone, in clay deposits formed by the weathering of limestone, in marine deposits, and in cavities in igneous rock. It commonly forms as large tabular crystals, as rosettelike aggregates of those crystals, or as divergent plates known as crested barite. Commercially, ground barite has been used in oil well and gas well drilling muds; in the preparation of barium compounds; as a body, or filler, for paper, cloth, and phonograph records; as a white pigment (see lithopone); and as an inert body in coloured paints. It forms a solid solution series with celestine, in which strontium replaces barium. For detailed physical properties, see sulfate mineral (table).
By the early 21st century, China and India had become the worldâ€™s top producers of barite, and significant amounts were also being mined by the United States, Morocco, and Iran.
