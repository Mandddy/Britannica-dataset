Drew Brees,  (born January 15, 1979, Dallas, Texas, U.S.) American gridiron football quarterback who led the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL) to the team’s first Super Bowl championship (2010).
Brees was a standout high-school football player in Austin, Texas, leading his team to a state title and taking Texas 5A (the division that features the state’s largest high schools) Offensive Player of the Year honours in 1996. Considered too short (standing 6 feet [1.83 metres] tall) and too weak-armed by the major college programs in his home state, he attended Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Brees was a three-year starter at Purdue, where he set school and Big Ten Conference records for almost every major career passing statistic, including passing yards and touchdowns. In his senior season he led the Purdue Boilermakers to their first Rose Bowl berth in 34 years and finished third in the voting for the Heisman Trophy.
