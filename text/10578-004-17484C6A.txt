Jumping spider (family Salticidae), any of more than 5,000 species of spiders (order Araneida) known for their ability to jump and pounce upon their prey. They range in size from 2 to 22 mm (0.08 to 0.87 inch), although most are small to medium-sized. They are very common in the tropics, but some also live in northern and even Arctic regions. Though there are a few species that have hairy bodies, most species have few hairs (setae). The body is often brightly coloured or strikingly patterned. Jumping spiders have keen vision for spiders and are active during the day in sunny areas. At night they hide in closely woven nests under bark, stones, or leaves. However, not all species make enclosed shelters. Most jumping spiders are solitary, and—with a few exceptions, such as certain species that mimic ants and when adult males cohabitate with females—jumping spiders do not nest together. In some cases a male will build a nest near the nest of an immature female of the same species and will mate with the female once she matures.
Males and females of the species Phintella vittata are able to detect ultraviolet light from the so-called UVB band (315–280 nm) and have specialized surfaces on their bodies to reflect it. The reflection of UVB radiation by males during courtship has been shown to enhance their ability to attract females.
