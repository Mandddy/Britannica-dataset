Marie de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand,  (born 1697, Château of Chamrond, Burgundy, Fr.—died  Sept. 23, 1780, Paris) woman of letters and a leading figure in French society.
She was born of a noble family, educated at a convent in Paris, and married at 21 to her kinsman Jean-Baptiste de La Lande, Marquis du Deffand, from whom she separated in 1722. She was by that time taking part in the extremely dissipated life that characterized the entourage of the regent, Philippe II, Duke d’Orléans, whose mistress she became. She was frequently seen at Sceaux, where the Duchess du Maine held court amid a brilliant company that included Fontenelle, the Marquise de Lambert, Voltaire, and Jean-François Hénault, president of the Parlement of Paris, with whom she lived on intimate if not always friendly terms until his death in 1770. When she set up her own salon, she attracted scientists, writers, wits, and all who were of any consequence in the world of letters and in society.
