Spring hare (Pedetes capensis), also spelled springhare,  a bipedal grazing rodent indigenous to Africa. About the size of a rabbit, the spring hare more closely resembles a giant jerboa in having a short round head, a thick muscular neck, very large eyes, and long, narrow upright ears. Like jerboas, it has short forelegs but long, powerful hind legs and feet used for jumping. Standing on its hind feet and using its tail as a brace, the spring hare moves in a series of short hops with its forefeet held close to the body. When alarmed, it travels quickly in erratic leaps of 2 to 3 metres (6.6 to 9.8 feet) until it reaches a burrow.
Found throughout southern and eastern Africa northward into Kenya, spring hares live in open arid habitats of sandy ground, overgrazed or floodplain grasslands, dry riverbeds, sparse scrub, and cultivated areas. During the day they den in burrows, usually in well-drained, hard-packed sandy soils on flat open land near an abundant source of grass. They dig by using sharp curved claws on the five digits of their forefeet. Large flattened claws on the four digits of the hind feet allow them to throw loosened soil clear of the excavation. Grass is their primary food; they consume all parts of the plant, including roots, but different parts are preferred in different seasons. They sometimes eat locusts as well as cultivated crops. Litters of one (rarely two) young may be born at any time during the year or, depending on geography, only during the wet season.
