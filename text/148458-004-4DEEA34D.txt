Computer worm, computer program designed to furtively copy itself into other computers. Unlike a computer virus, which “infects” other programs in order to transmit itself to still more programs, worms are generally independent programs and need no “host.” In fact, worms typically need no human action to replicate across networks.
On November 2, 1988, a computer science student at Cornell University named Robert Morris released the first worm onto the Internet from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (As a guest on the campus, he hoped to remain anonymous.) The worm was an experimental self-propagating and replicating computer program that took advantage of flaws in certain e-mail protocols. Because of a mistake in its programming, rather than just sending copies of itself to other computers, this software kept replicating itself on each infected system, filling all the available computer memory. Before a fix was found, the worm had brought some 6,000 computers (one-tenth of the Internet) to a halt. Although Morris’s worm cost time and millions of dollars to fix, the event had few commercial consequences, for the Internet had not yet become a fixture of economic affairs (see e-commerce). That Morris’s father was the head of computer security for the U.S. National Security Agency led the press to treat the event more as a high-tech Oedipal drama than as a foreshadowing of things to come.
