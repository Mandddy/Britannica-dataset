Sir Reginald Wingate, 1st Baronet, in full Sir Francis Reginald Wingate   (born June 25, 1861, Port Glasgow, Renfrew, Scot.—died  Jan. 28, 1953, Dunbar, East Lothian) British general and imperial administrator, principal founder and governor-general (1899–1916) of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (from 1956 the independent Republic of The Sudan).
Commissioned in the British artillery in 1880, Wingate was assigned to the Egyptian army in 1883. Six years later he became director of Egyptian military intelligence. He fought in several battles against adherents of al-Mahdī (Muḥammad Aḥmad, a nationalist rebel against the British-supported Egyptian overlordship of the Sudan), and on Nov. 24, 1899, he defeated and killed the Khalifa ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad, successor to al-Mahdī. The next month he was appointed governor-general of the Sudan and sirdar (commander in chief) of the Egyptian army. Under his direction the Sudan developed a sound government, and, in part because of his influence, the country remained loyal to Great Britain and its allies in World War I. From June 1916 Wingate, in Khartoum, assisted Saudi rebels in Arabia against the rule of Turkey, with which Great Britain was at war. In January 1917 he was named British high commissioner for Egypt. Although his sympathy with the Egyptian Nationalist Party led to his dismissal in October 1919, subsequent British policy in Egypt generally followed his recommendations.
