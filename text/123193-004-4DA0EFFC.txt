Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve,  (born January 3, 1756, Chartres, France—died 1794, near Saint-Émilion) politician of the French Revolution who was at first a close associate, and later a bitter enemy, of the Jacobin leader Maximilien de Robespierre.
The son of a lawyer of Chartres, Pétion practiced as an advocate before accepting a seat with the bourgeois Third Estate at the Estates-General of 1789. When the Third Estate obtained control of the Estates-General (becoming the National Assembly) and set about abolishing France’s feudal institutions, Pétion and Robespierre led the small minority of deputies who pressed for enfranchisement of the lower classes and other far-reaching democratic reforms. The National Assembly dissolved itself on September 30, 1791, and in November Pétion was elected mayor of Paris. Without breaking with Robespierre, he formed ties with the Girondins, the moderate bourgeois democrats who opposed Robespierre in the newly formed Legislative Assembly.
