Sergio Pitol,  (born March 18, 1933, Puebla, Mex.) Mexican author, whose work drew heavily on his experiences from time spent abroad and probed at length the meaning of identity. He was the recipient of the 2005 Cervantes Prize.
Pitol was born into a family of Italian descent. His childhood was a difficult one, marked by his mother’s death by drowning. He studied both literature and law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City (1950–55), and by 1960 he had begun working for Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Relations. Pitol served as a cultural attaché in Poland, Hungary, and France during the 1970s, traveled to Italy, the U.S.S.R., and China, and eventually became Mexico’s ambassador to Czechoslovakia in the mid-1980s. He taught at the University of Veracruz, Xalapa, Mex. (1966–77), and the University of Bristol, Eng. (1971–72), and translated literary works from English and Polish.
