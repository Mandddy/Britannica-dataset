Some Like It Hot, American screwball comedy film, released in 1959, that is considered one of best in that genre. Some Like It Hot featured Marilyn Monroe as a “dumb blonde” and Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as women.
Curtis and Lemmon played down-on-their luck musicians who are marked for death by a gangster after they accidentally witness a gangland killing, which was based on the real St. Valentine’s Day Massacre of 1929. To hide from the mob, the pair pose as members of a traveling women’s band. They quickly become infatuated with the lead singer (played by Monroe), who fails to realize that her bandmates are actually men masquerading as women.
