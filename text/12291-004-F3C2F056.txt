Étienne Dolet,  (born Aug. 3, 1509, Orléans, France—died  Aug. 3, 1546, Paris) French humanist, scholar, and printer whose Commentarii linguae Latinae contributed notably to Latin scholarship. He is often described as “the first martyr of the Renaissance.”
After studying at Paris and the universities of Padua and Venice, Dolet settled in Toulouse, France. His quarrelsome temperament, unrestrained enthusiasm for Renaissance learning, and anticlericalism involved him in personal and public controversies. He was banished from the University of Toulouse and moved to Lyon, where for a time he was imprisoned for the justifiable homicide of a painter; he was released by royal pardon.
