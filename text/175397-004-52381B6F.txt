A Star Is Born, American musical film, released in 1954, that was the third—and widely considered the most enduring—version of the classic tale of passion and jealousy between a Hollywood power couple.
The film charts the rise of Esther Blodgett (played by Judy Garland) from band singer to Hollywood star. When drunken actor Norman Maine (James Mason) staggers onto the stage during her performance for a crowd of Hollywood elite, she incorporates the intrusion into her act and saves him from further embarrassment. A grateful Maine introduces her to the head of a film studio. Blodgett changes her name to Vicki Lester at the behest of the studio, and, after appearing in a hit musical, her career skyrockets. The two performers fall in love and marry, but their union is tested by Maine’s declining career and chronic alcoholism. Maine, despondent over his career and the pain he has caused Blodgett, eventually drowns himself.
