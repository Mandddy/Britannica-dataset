Tilman Riemenschneider,  (born c. 1460, Heilgenstadt or Osterode, Domain of the Teutonic Order [Germany]—died July 7, 1531, Würzburg) master sculptor whose wood portrait carvings and statues made him one of the major artists of the late Gothic period in Germany; he was known as the leader of the Lower Franconia school.
Riemenschneider was the son of the mint master of Würzburg, and the younger Riemenschneider opened a highly successful workshop there in 1483. As a civic leader he was councillor (1504–20) and burgomaster (1520–25). During the Peasants’ Revolt (1525), he sympathized with the revolutionaries and was imprisoned for a short time, during which he temporarily lost his civic responsibilities and patrons.
