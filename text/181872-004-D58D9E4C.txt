Sir John Forrest, also called (1918) Baron Forrest of Bunbury  (born August 22, 1847, Preston Point, near Bunbury, Western Australia—died  September 3, 1918, at sea) explorer and statesman who led pioneer expeditions into Australia’s western interior. As Western Australia’s first premier (1890–1901), he sponsored public works construction and negotiated the state’s entry into the Australian Commonwealth in 1901.
After entering Western Australia’s survey department in 1865, Forrest in 1869 led a search expedition for the missing explorer Ludwig Leichhardt and, in 1870, an expedition from Perth along the Great Australian Bight to Adelaide. In 1874 he completed a 2,700-mile (4,300-kilometre) crossing of the continent from Champion Bay to the telegraph line between Adelaide and Port Darwin.
