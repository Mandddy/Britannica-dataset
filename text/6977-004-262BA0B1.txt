Bull riding, rodeo event in which the contestant attempts to ride a bucking bull for eight seconds while holding with one hand a braided rope made of nylon or Manila that is wrapped around the animal’s chest. A weighted cow bell attached to the rope pulls it free when the ride is over. No stirrups, bridle, or saddle are used; the rider’s arm absorbs the full force of the bull’s bucking. The rider wraps a section of the flat rope around one hand and wrist, as well as back across the gloved palm, locks the fingers down, and sits with arm bent before the bull is released from the chute. The rider is not required to spur, but doing so may result in a higher score. Disqualification occurs if the free hand touches the rider’s body, the equipment, or the bull, or if the rider is bucked off before the whistle blows. The contestant is scored for skill and technique, the bull for difficulty. The two scores are combined, and the rider with the highest total wins.
