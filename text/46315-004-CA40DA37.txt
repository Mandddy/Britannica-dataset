Marsh frog (Rana ridibunda), also called lake frog,  large aquatic frog of the “true frog” family Ranidae, occurring naturally from the France to the Urals and by introduction in southern England. This species seldom occurs more than 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6.5 feet) from the edge of permanent water. It is the largest of the European ranids; females grow to 13 cm (5 inches) long, whereas males grow to 9 cm (3.5 inches) long.
The pool frog (R. lessonae) is the other species of European aquatic frogs. They may interbreed with marsh frogs to produce a hybrid form called the European edible frog (R. esculenta). Male and female edible frogs may breed with males and females of either R. ridibunda or R. lessonae to produce viable offspring; however, breeding between male and female edible frogs results in infertile eggs or offspring incapable of surviving.
