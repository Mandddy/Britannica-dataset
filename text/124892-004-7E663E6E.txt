Electric arc,  continuous, high-density electric current between two separated conductors in a gas or vapour with a relatively low potential difference, or voltage, across the conductors. The high-intensity light and heat of arcs are utilized in welding, in carbon-arc lamps and arc furnaces that operate at ordinary air pressure, and in low-pressure sodium-arc and mercury-arc lamps.
