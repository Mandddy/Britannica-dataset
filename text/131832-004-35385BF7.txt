Henry Rowe Schoolcraft,  (born March 28, 1793, Albany County, N.Y., U.S.—died  Dec. 10, 1864, Washington, D.C.) American explorer and ethnologist noted for his discovery of the source of the Mississippi River and for his writings on the Native peoples of the North American Plains.
Schoolcraft’s initial contact with the frontier came during a mineralogical trip through present Missouri and Arkansas (1817–18). He next served as topographer on an expedition to the upper Mississippi and Lake Superior region (1820) and published a journal of his travels in 1821. His experience among Native Americans led to his appointment as a federal agent to the indigenous peoples of the Lake Superior region. There in 1822 he married a woman who was part Ojibwa, and her people became the subject of his special study. In 1832 he again explored the upper reaches of the Mississippi River and located its source at Lake Itasca in present Minnesota. His Narrative of an Expedition . . . to Itasca Lake . . . (1834) was reissued, with an account of the 1820 expedition, in Summary Narrative (1855).
