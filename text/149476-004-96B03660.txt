Paris Zoo, zoological park, comprising the Menagerie of the Botanical Garden (Ménagerie du Jardin des Plantes) and the Zoological Park of Paris (Parc Zoologique de Paris), both services of the French National Museum of Natural History.
In 1793 the Jardin des Plantes, which was originally a botanical garden, became the first public zoo in France. The compact 6.5-hectare (16-acre) area, with formal 18th-century landscaping, was retained when the Jardin was renovated between 1918 and 1939. It holds some 1,100 specimens, including the rare Przewalski’s horse. The zoo has had excellent success breeding this and other species.
