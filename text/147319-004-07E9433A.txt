Tectonics, scientific study of the deformation of the rocks that make up the Earthâ€™s crust and the forces that produce such deformation. It deals with the folding and faulting associated with mountain building; the large-scale, gradual upward and downward movements of the crust (epeirogenic movements); and sudden horizontal displacements along faults. Other phenomena studied include igneous processes and metamorphism. Tectonics embraces as its chief working principle the concept of plate tectonics, a theory that was formulated in the late 1960s by American, Canadian, and British geophysicists to broaden and synthesize the notion of continental drift and the seafloor spreading hypothesis.
