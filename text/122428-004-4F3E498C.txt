Johann Eck, original name Johann Maier   (born Nov. 13, 1486, Egg, Swabia [Germany]—died  Feb. 10, 1543, Ingolstadt, Bavaria [Germany]) German theologian who was Martin Luther’s principal Roman Catholic opponent.
Early in his career Maier adopted the name of his home village, Egg (or Eck), as his surname. He studied at the universities of Heidelberg, Tübingen, Cologne, and Freiburg im Breisgau. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1508 and became a doctor of theology in 1510. In that year he began a lifelong career as professor of theology at the University of Ingolstadt. Eck’s early treatises attracted attention, among them one of the first theses (1514) attacking the medieval prohibition against charging interest on money.
