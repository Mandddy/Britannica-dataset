Johan Ludvig Runeberg,  (born Feb. 5, 1804, Jakobstad, Swedish Finland [now Pietarsaari, Fin.]—died  May 6, 1877, Borgå, Russian Finland [now Porvoo, Fin.]) Finno-Swedish poet who is generally considered to be the national poet of Finland. His works, which express the patriotic spirit of his countrymen, were written in Swedish and exercised great influence on Swedish literature as well.
While a student at Åbo (Turku) University, Runeberg was inspired by Romantic nationalism. His academic career was interrupted by the need to earn a living, and he became a private tutor on an estate in Saarijärvi. There, in the heart of the Finnish countryside, he came to know and love Finland’s landscape and people and heard firsthand some of the stories of the heroic past that were to be the themes of his best work. He returned to the university, which had moved to Helsinki, in 1830 and became clerk to the council and in 1831, lecturer in Latin language and literature. In the same year, he received a gold medal from the Swedish academy for his verse romance of Finnish life, Grafven i Perho (“The Grave at Perho”). In 1837 he moved to Borgå (Porvoo), where he was lecturer in classics until 1857 and rector of that college in 1847–50. For the last 13 years of his life he was partly paralyzed and unable to write.
