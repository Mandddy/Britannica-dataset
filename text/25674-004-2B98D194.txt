John Playford,  (born 1623, Norwich, Norfolk, Eng.—died  November 1686?, London) English music publisher and bookseller whose popular and frequently expanded collection of music and dance steps remains the principal source of knowledge of English country dance steps and melodies. His book, The English Dancing-Master (1650, but dated 1651; critical ed., M. Dean-Smith, 1958), originally contained 104 dances and accompanying tunes set to the fiddle; its 18th and last edition (1728, published by John Young) held about 700. Many of the Playford dances were revived in the 20th century.
By 1648 Playford had established his business in London, where he became a clerk of the Temple Church and moved to the Inner Temple. The friend as well as the publisher of most of the English composers of the time, Playford was himself a competent musician and often included his own song and psalm music in his collections of music. His Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick, a handbook on music theory and practice, went into many editions between 1654 and 1730 and was revised in 1694 by the composer Henry Purcell. An elegy on Playford’s death, “Gentle shepherds, you that know,” by Nahum Tate, was set to music by Purcell.
