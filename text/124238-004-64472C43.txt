Brain scanning, any of a number of diagnostic methods for detecting intracranial abnormalities.
The oldest of the brain-scanning procedures still in use is a simple, relatively noninvasive procedure called isotope scanning. It is based on the tendency of certain radioactive isotopes to concentrate selectively in tumours and blood vessel lesions. The procedure involves the injection of a radioactive isotope (such as technetium-99m or iodine-131) into a blood vessel that supplies the cranial region. As the substance becomes localized within the brain, it decays, therewith emitting gamma rays. The concentration of rays at a given site, as measured by a movable radiation detection device, can reveal the presence, the shape, and often the size of the intracranial abnormality. In many cases, isotope scanning has been replaced by computerized axial tomography (CAT), or computed tomography (CT).
