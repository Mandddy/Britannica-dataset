Agis IV,  (born c. 263 bc—died  241) Spartan king (244–241) who failed in his attempt to reform Sparta’s economic and political structure.
Agis succeeded his father, Eudamidas II, at the age of 19. Drawing upon the tradition of the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus, Agis sought to reform a system that distributed the land and wealth unequally and burdened the poor with debt. He proposed the cancellation of debts and the division of the Spartan homeland into 4,500 lots for citizens. By this time the number of full citizens had dwindled to 700. Full citizenship was to be extended to many perioeci (voteless freemen) and foreigners, and 15,000 lots were to be distributed to the remaining perioeci. In addition to pursuing these reforms, Agis sought the restoration of the Lycurgan system of military training.
