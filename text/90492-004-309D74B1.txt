Committees of Correspondence, groups appointed by the legislatures in the 13 British American colonies to provide colonial leadership and aid intercolonial cooperation.
Their emergence as agencies of colonial discontent was prompted by Samuel Adams, who, at a Boston town meeting on November 2, 1772, secured the appointment of a 21-man “committee of correspondence…to state the rights of the Colonists and of this Province in particular, as men, as Christians, and as subjects; and to communicate and publish the same to the several Towns in the Province and to the World.” Within three months some 80 similar groups had been formed locally in Massachusetts. In March 1773 the Virginia House of Burgesses organized legislative standing committees for intercolonial correspondence, with Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry among their 11 members. By the end of 1773, eight other American colonies had followed Virginia’s example. The committees played a major role in promoting colonial unity and in summoning in September 1774 the First Continental Congress (see Continental Congress), a majority of whose delegates were committee members.
