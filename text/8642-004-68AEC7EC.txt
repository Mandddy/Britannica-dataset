The Pompidou Centre was formally opened on January 31, 1977, by the French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Its overpowering industrial-looking exterior, which dwarfs its surroundings, attracted notoriety for its brightly coloured exterior pipes, ducts, and other exposed services. The architects were Renzo Piano of Italy and Richard Rogers of Britain. The Pompidou Centre quickly became a popular attraction and was reckoned to be the most frequently visited cultural monument in the world.
