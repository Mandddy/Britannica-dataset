Leonor de Almeida de Portugal, Marquesa de Alorna, pseudonym Alcipe or Alcippe   (born 1750, Lisbon, Port.—died 1839, Lisbon) Portuguese poet whose work forms a bridge between the literary periods of Arcádia and Romanticism in Portugal; her style leans toward the Romantic, but she favoured such classical forms as the ode and epithet and made many allusions to mythology and the classics. Her influential verse, translations, and letters are collected in the six-volume Obras poéticas (1844).
When her grandmother was executed for political reasons in 1758, Almeida de Portugal was detained along with her mother and sister in the convent of Chelas until 1777. She was tutored by Francisco Manuel do Nascimento, who gave her the Arcadian name Alcipe. After founding a political group called the Society of the Rose in 1803, she was exiled to London until 1814. Upon her return to Lisbon, she inherited the title of Marquesa de Alorna and founded a literary salon. Her diverse writings, ranging in temperament from spontaneous exclamations to melancholic odes, are concerned with such idealistic themes as political liberty and scientific progress. Among the authors she translated or paraphrased are Homer, Horace, Alexander Pope, Oliver Goldsmith, and Alphonse de Lamartine.
