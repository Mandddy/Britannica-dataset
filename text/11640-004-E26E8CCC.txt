Heinrich, baron von Gagern,  (born August 20, 1799, Bayreuth, Germany—died May 22, 1880, Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt) second son of Hans Christoph von Gagern, liberal, anti-Austrian German politician and president of the 1848–49 Frankfurt National Assembly, who was one of the leading spokesmen for the Kleindeutsch (Little German) solution to German unification before and during the 1848 revolution.
Wounded at Waterloo at the age of 16, Gagern studied in Heidelberg, Göttingen, and Jena. A liberal nationalist, he was instrumental in founding the Allgemeine Deutsche Burschenschaft, a student organization dedicated to the unification of Germany. He entered the Hesse-Darmstadt civil service in 1821 and served in the Landtag (lower house) from 1832 to 1836. Reentering politics in 1847, he became chief minister of Hesse-Darmstadt in March 1848. Gagern’s role in the revolutionary Vorparlament (pre-parliament) was distinguished, but on May 19, 1848, he was elected president of the national assembly at Frankfurt. He secured the election of the Austrian archduke John as German regent and attempted to persuade Prussia to play the chief role in a unified Germany without eliminating Austria altogether. His proposal to offer the imperial crown to Frederick William IV of Prussia was finally accepted by the assembly, but the Prussian monarch’s refusal destroyed his hopes. Gagern left Frankfurt when Archduke John dissolved the assembly on May 10, 1849. Retiring from politics, he served in the German Army against Denmark (1850). Later, he turned to Austria and by 1862 had come to favour the Austria-oriented Grossdeutsch (Greater German) solution. From 1864 to 1872 he served as Hessian minister to Vienna. When Gagern died in 1880, he was a forgotten man.
