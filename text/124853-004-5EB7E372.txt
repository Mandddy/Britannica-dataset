General strike, stoppage of work by a substantial proportion of workers in a number of industries in an organized endeavour to achieve economic or political objectives. A strike covering only one industry cannot properly be called a general strike.
The idea of a general strike, as a deliberate part of the tactics of collective bargaining, apparently originated in Great Britain, where the term had entered the language by the 1830s. Later in the century in France, syndicalist thinkers believed that workers could achieve a social revolution by using a general strike to directly overthrow the owners of industry.
