Donovan Bailey,  (born Dec. 16, 1967, Manchester, Jam.) Jamaican-born Canadian sprinter who specialized in the 100-metre dash, winning a gold medal in the event at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
Bailey moved to Oakville, Ont., Can., in 1981 to live with his father. He was on the track team in high school, and at age 16 he ran the 100-metre dash in 10.65 sec. He did not pursue running seriously, however, and instead focused on basketball. He played forward on the basketball team at Sheridan College, Oakville, where he studied economics. After receiving a diploma in business administration, Bailey started his own marketing and investment-consulting business. Sports became his hobby, and he occasionally entered sprint races. In 1991 he won the 60-metre dash at the Ontario indoor championships. Training only sporadically, Bailey did not make the Canadian track team for the 1991 world championships or the 1992 Olympics.
