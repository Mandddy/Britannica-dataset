Vance Palmer, in full Edward Vance Palmer  (born August 28, 1885, Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia—died July 15, 1959, Melbourne, Victoria) Australian author of novels, short stories, and plays whose work is noted for disciplined diction and frequent understatement. He is considered one of the founders of Australian drama.
Palmer was born and educated in Queensland. He published his first work in English magazines when he was only 17 years old, and two years later he went to London to become a writer, meeting with some success. He returned, however, by way of Finland, Russia, Siberia, and the East and spent several years working at a variety of jobs in the Australian outback. He next took up writing again, traveling to London and the United States, and then served with Australian forces during World War I. From 1922 to 1926 he and his wife, Nettie (née Janet Higgins, also a writer), helped organize the Pioneer Players, a theatrical company in Melbourne specializing in Australian drama.
