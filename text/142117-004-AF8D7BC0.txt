Lahn River,  river, a right-bank tributary of the Rhine River, rising on the Jagd Berg (2,218 feet [676 m]), a summit of the Rothaar Hills in western Germany. The river, which is 152 miles (245 km) long, first flows eastward and then southward to Giessen, before turning southwestward and, with a winding course, reaching the Rhine at Lahnstein. Small barges are able to navigate to Giessen on the partly canalized river. Its valley, the lower part of which divides the Taunus (mountains) from the Westerwald (mountains), is often very narrow.
Among the towns and sites of interest on the Lahnâ€™s banks are Marburg and Giessen, each with a university; Wetzlar, with a cathedral; Runkel, with a castle; Limburg, with a cathedral; the castles and medieval ruins of Schaumburg, Balduinstein, Laurenburg, Langenau, Burg Stein, and Nassau; and the health resort of Bad Ems.
