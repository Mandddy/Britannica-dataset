Bjarni Vigfússon Thórarensen,  (born December 30, 1786, Brautarholt, near Reykjavík, Iceland—died August 24, 1841, Modhruvellir) first Romantic nationalist poet of Iceland.
The precocious son of a prominent family, Thórarensen completed law studies in Copenhagen at age 20. While there he also attended the lectures of the German philosopher Henrik Steffens, who introduced Romanticism to Denmark. Thórarensen’s stay abroad increased his nostalgic devotion to Iceland, which he regarded as the birthplace of heroism, in contrast to cosmopolitan Denmark. There he wrote his poem “Eldgamla Ísafold” (“Ancient Iceland”), which became a nationally recognized song in Iceland. He returned to Iceland to serve as deputy justice in 1811 and as justice of the Supreme Court from 1817 to 1833, when he became governor of North and East Iceland. Thórarensen’s enthusiasm for Iceland’s primitive traditions and his reintroduction of the simple Eddaic metres were instrumental in turning the Icelanders’ attention away from Europe and back to their own past. Love poems and funeral elegies constitute his best poems. Together with his songs, such as “Thú nafnkunna landid” (“You Renowned Land”), in which he eulogizes Iceland’s poverty and isolation for preserving its people from softness, they made him one of the most revered Icelandic poets of his era.
