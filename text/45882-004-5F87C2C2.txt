Educated at the University of Bologna, he taught jurisprudence there from 1531 to 1539. Because of his expertise in canon law, he was sent by Pope Pius IV in 1561 to the Council of Trent (Trento, Italy), where he remained until 1563. Pius made him cardinal in 1565 and emissary to Spain. He was elected pope on May 14, 1572, succeeding St. Pius V.
