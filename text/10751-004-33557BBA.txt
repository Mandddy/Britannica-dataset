Isère River,  river, southeastern France, originating in the Savoy Alps on the Italian frontier and flowing 180 miles (290 km) to its confluence with the Rhône above Valence, draining a basin of approximately 4,600 square miles (12,000 square km). It rises in an amphitheatre of glaciers at 7,900 feet (2,400 m) near the Col (pass) de l’Iseran and rushes down past Val d’Isère into the artificial lake formed by Tignes Dam. It continues through the Tarentaise Valley past Bourg-Saint-Maurice, where it is dammed again. The river then zigzags across mountain ranges passing through Albertville, where it receives the Arly and turns southwest, flowing through the Combe de Savoie depression. The Arc River, which rises in the Mont Levanna glaciers to the southwest of the Isère on the Italian frontier and flows along the Maurienne Valley through Modane and Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, joins it from the west, midway along the Combe de Savoie depression. The combined stream crosses into the Isère département and flows along the Vallée de Graisivaudan depression, passing through Grenoble. It makes a sharp northwestward bend before continuing its southwesterly course to the Rhône. The Isère is not navigable, but it is used in many places for hydroelectric power.
