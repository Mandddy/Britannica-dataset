Fomalhaut, also called Alpha Piscis Austrini,  the 18th star (excluding the Sun) in order of apparent brightness. It is used in navigation because of its conspicuous place in a sky region otherwise lacking in bright stars. It lies in the southern constellation Piscis Austrinus, 25 light-years from Earth. A white star, it has an apparent magnitude of 1.16. A sixth-magnitude companion star, HR 8721, is yellow and orbits at a distance of about 0.9 light-year. A belt of dust orbits between 19.9 and 23.6 billion km (12.4 and 14.7 billion miles) from the star. The dust belt appears to be filled with comets like the solar systemâ€™s Kuiper belt. Its infrared brightness indicates that every day about 2,000 comets about 1 km (0.6 mile) in size are colliding with each other. Images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004 and 2006 seemed to show a planet, Fomalhaut b, orbiting inside the dust belt at a distance of 17.8 billion km (11.1 billion miles) from the star, but subsequent images taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope showed no such planet.
In astrology, Fomalhaut is one of the four royal stars, along with Aldebaran, Regulus, and Antares.
