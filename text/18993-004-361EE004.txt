John Burgoyne,  (born 1722, Sutton, Bedfordshire, England—died  June 4, 1792, London) British general, best remembered for his defeat by superior American forces in the Saratoga (New York) campaign of 1777, during the American Revolution.
After serving with distinction in the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), Burgoyne was elected to the House of Commons in 1761 and again in 1768. Assigned to Canada in 1776 as a major general, he entered into an offensive in which British armies from the north (Burgoyne’s troops), south (General Sir William Howe’s), and west (Colonel Barry St. Leger’s) would unite at Albany, New York, isolating New England from the other rebellious colonies. Burgoyne’s force captured Fort Ticonderoga, New York, on July 6, 1777, but, after reaching the Hudson River, was fought to a standstill by a much larger army commanded successively by General Philip Schuyler and General Horatio Gates, who were brilliantly assisted by Brigadier General Benedict Arnold. Exhausting his food and ammunition and receiving no aid from Howe (who chose to fight in Pennsylvania) or St. Leger (who was defeated at Oriskany, New York, and withdrew westward), Burgoyne had to surrender to Gates north of Saratoga Springs on October 17, 1777. Paroled along with his troops, he returned to England, where he faced severe criticism. For a short time (1782–83) he was commander in chief in Ireland, but he retired increasingly to private life, in which he was a leader of London society and fashion. He also wrote several plays, of which the most successful was The Heiress (1786).
