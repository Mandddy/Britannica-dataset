The Philadelphia Story, American romantic comedy film, released in 1940, focusing on manners and marriage and especially noted for its cast—Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, and Cary Grant.
The Philadelphia Story was based on a popular Broadway play that was written for Hepburn. In director George Cukor’s film adaptation, she reprised the role of Tracy Lord, an arrogant socialite whose ex-husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (played by Grant), appears as she is about to remarry. In hopes of winning her back, Haven tries to prevent a magazine from publishing a story about her womanizing father.
