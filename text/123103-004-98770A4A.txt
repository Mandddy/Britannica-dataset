Woodruff,  any of various species of plants of a genus (Asperula) belonging to the madder family, Rubiaceae. The woodruff is found growing wild in woods and shady places in many countries of Europe, and its leaves are used as herbs. The genus Asperula includes annuals and perennials, usually with square stems. Their small, funnel-shaped flowers are clustered, and a few species are cultivated for ornamental uses. Sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) is in a separate genus; it was formerly classified as A. odorata.
