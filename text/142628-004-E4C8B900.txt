Brisbane River, river in southeastern Queensland, Australia. It rises in the Brisbane-Cooyar ranges and flows some 215 miles (345 km) southeasterly and northeasterly through a farming and dairying region, then through the city of Brisbane to Moreton Bay. Its chief tributaries are the Stanley and Bremer rivers and Lockyer Creek. The Brisbane River is navigable for steamers below Brisbane (about 15 miles [25 km]) and for small craft below Ipswich (50 miles [80 km]). The stream was reached in 1823 by three convicts fleeing from Sydney and was explored by Lieut. John Oxley, who captured them. It was named for Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane, governor of New South Wales (1821â€“25). Ferry service began in 1843 and steamer service in 1846; the first bridge across the river was completed in 1865. Historically, several catastrophic floods of the Brisbane River have occurred, notably in 1893 and 1974. Heavy rains in early 2011 caused the river to flood and to inundate several riverside communities, including large portions of Brisbane.
