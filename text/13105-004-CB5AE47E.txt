Georg Büchner,  (born Oct. 17, 1813, Goddelau, Hesse-Darmstadt [Germany]—died  Feb. 19, 1837, Zürich, Switz.) German dramatist, a major forerunner of the Expressionist school of playwriting of the early 20th century.
The son of an army doctor, Büchner studied medicine at the Universities of Strasbourg and Giessen. Caught up in the movement inspired by the Paris uprising of 1830, Büchner published a pamphlet, Der hessische Landbote (1834; The Hessian Messenger), in Giessen calling for economic and political revolution, and he also founded a radical society, the Society for Human Rights. He escaped arrest by fleeing to Strasbourg, where he completed a dissertation. This earned him an appointment as a lecturer in natural science at the University of Zürich in 1836. He died in Zürich of typhoid fever the following year.
