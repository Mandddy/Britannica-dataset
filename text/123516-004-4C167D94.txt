Blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), an antelope (family Bovidae) indigenous to the plains of India. The blackbuck is an antelope of the same tribe (Antilopini) that includes gazelles, the springbok, and the gerenuk. What sets the blackbuck apart from the rest is the adult male’s horns, which are long (50–61 cm [20–24 inches], the record being 71.5 cm [28.1 inches]), spirally twisted, V-shaped, and covered with pronounced ridges nearly to the tips. In addition, there is a striking contrast between the black-and-white coloration of mature male blackbucks and the reddish yellow coloration of females and immature males—a much greater contrast than is found in any of the blackbuck’s tribal relatives.
Male blackbucks weigh 34–45 kg (75–100 pounds) and stand 74–88 cm (29–35 inches) at the shoulder. Females are not much smaller, weighing 31–39 kg (68–86 pounds) and having shoulder heights only a few centimetres shorter than the males. Females also have the same white markings as males, including circular eye patches, mouth, underside, inner legs, and rump patch. The only obvious difference between females and immature males is the presence of horns. Even black males, which are most colourful at the end of the monsoon season, begin to fade in midwinter after the annual molt and turn quite brown by early April when hot weather returns. In fact there is one southern Indian population in which the males never turn black. Nevertheless, male blackbucks are still darker than females and immature males.
