Jean-Claude Duvalier, byname Baby Doc, French Bébé Doc  (born July 3, 1951, Port-au-Prince, Haiti—died October 4, 2014, Port-au-Prince) president of Haiti from 1971 to 1986.
The only son of François (“Papa Doc”) Duvalier, Jean-Claude succeeded his father as president for life in April 1971, becoming at age 19 the youngest president in the world. Partly because of pressure from the United States to moderate the tyrannical and corrupt practices of his father’s regime, Duvalier instituted budgetary and judicial reforms, replaced a few older cabinet members with younger men, released some political prisoners, and eased press censorship, professing a policy of “gradual democratization of institutions.”
