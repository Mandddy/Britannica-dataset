Charles Macklin, original name Charles McLaughlin  (born 1690/99, Ireland—died  July 11, 1797, London, Eng.) Irish actor and playwright whose distinguished though turbulent career spanned most of the 18th century.
Macklin first appeared as an actor at Bristol and in 1725 went to Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London. A man of violent nature, he was a pioneer against the stilted declamation of his day. He went to Drury Lane Theatre in 1733 and later was concerned in its management. In 1735 he killed another actor in the greenroom over a dispute about a wig, but, although prosecuted, he received no sentence. He set the seal on his stage career at Drury Lane on Feb. 14, 1741, when he played Shylock, rescuing the part from the broad comedy with which it had long been surrounded.
