Arsinoitherium, genus of extinct large, primitive, hoofed mammals that have been found as fossils in Egypt in deposits from the Eocene Epoch (56 million to 34 million years ago) and elsewhere in deposits from the Oligocene Epoch (34 million to 23 million years ago).
The animal, probably a swamp dweller, reached a length of about 3.5 metres (11 feet) and was about the size of a large rhinoceros. It carried an enormous pair of horns on the nasal bones and an additional, smaller pair of horns on the frontal bones. Relatives are known from Egypt to Southeast Asia. This animal is also considered to be distantly related to proboscideans (elephants and their kin).
