Human papillomavirus (HPV), any of a subgroup of viruses belonging to the family Papovaviridae that infect humans, causing warts (papillomas) and other benign tumours, as well as cancers of the genital tract and of the uterine cervix in women. They are small polygonal viruses containing circular double-stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid); more than 100 distinct types of HPVs have been identified by DNA analysis.
Skin warts are of two types, flat warts (which are superficial and usually on the hands) and plantar warts (on the soles of the feet and on the toes). Genital and venereal warts (condylomata acuminata) are caused by other types of HPVs. Most papillomas, whether found on the skin or in the mucous membranes of the genital, anal, or oral cavities, are benign and may actually go unnoticed for years. However, a minority of genital and venereal warts are visible, painful, or itchy. The HPVs that cause these warts are transmitted by sexual intercourse, and it is estimated that about 10 percent of the adult population in developed countries has papilloma infections of the genital tract.
