Chari River, also called Shari,  principal tributary feeding Lake Chad in north-central Africa. It flows through Chad and the Central African Republic and is formed by the Bamingui (its true headstream), the Gribingui, and the Ouham, which brings to it the greatest volume of water. Near Sarh the Chari is joined on its right bank by the Aouk, Kéita, and Salamat rivers, parallel streams that mingle in an immense floodplain. The Salamat, which rises in Darfur in Sudan, in its middle course is fed by the waters of Lake Iro. The river then divides into numerous branches that spread into a delta and end in the Chari. The Aouk, which forms the boundary between Chad and the Central African Republic, also rises in Darfur and sluggishly drains an immense marshy plain. In the dry season it is sometimes reduced to a succession of stagnant ponds; its floodwaters empty into the Chari in an extensive delta. Downstream from Sarh the Chari crosses the Gay Rapids near Niellim, broadening to 3 or 4 miles (5 or 6.5 km), and in its lower reaches divides into many channels. At N’Djamena, to the west, it joins the Logone and flows into Lake Chad through several distributaries. The total length of the Chari is about 870 miles (1,400 km). The Chari basin covers 250,000 square miles (650,000 square km), and the river unites the drainage of the southern part of the Chad inland basin. Steamboats navigate the main river for more than 530 miles (850 km) in the wet season. The existence of the Chari was made known to Europeans by the British explorers Dixon Denham, Hugh Clapperton, and Walter Oudney, who reached Lake Chad in 1823.
