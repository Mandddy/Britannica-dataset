Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain,  (born Dec. 14, 1911, Dessau, Ger.—died March 13, 1998, Melbourne, Fla., U.S.) German designer of the first operational jet engine.
After obtaining his doctorate at the University of Göttingen, he became a junior assistant to Hugo von Pohl, director of the Physical Institute there. When the German aircraft builder Ernst Heinkel asked the university for assistance in design, Pohl recommended Ohain, who joined Heinkel’s manufacturing firm in 1936. Ohain’s experiments, carried out in secret at Heinkel’s factory, resulted in a bench test by 1937 and a fully operational jet aircraft, the He 178, by 1939. This plane made the world’s first jet-powered aircraft flight on Aug. 27, 1939. Ohain’s centrifugal-flow turbojet engine, the HeS 3B, performed perfectly, though the landing gear of the plane failed to retract, preventing the test pilot from accelerating to planned speed.
