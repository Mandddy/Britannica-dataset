University of Rome, in full University of Rome “La Sapienza,” Italian Università degli Studi di Roma “La Sapienza”,  coeducational, autonomous state institution of higher learning in Rome. Founded in 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII, the university, known as the studium urbis (“place of study of the city”), operated for a time alongside the studium curiae (“place of study of the [papal] court”), founded 1244–45. Under Pope Leo X (1513–21), the two institutions were fused into one University of Rome, housed in a building called Sapienza (“Wisdom”), which for centuries gave its name to the university.
Under Leo X the university was reorganized and revitalized, employing 88 lecturers, many of distinction. In 1870, when the papacy lost the city of Rome to the Kingdom of Italy, the Sapienza became the basis of a royal university, which in 1935 became the present-day state university. Among the modern university’s faculties are law, medicine and surgery, political science, economics and commerce, letters and philosophy, mathematics, physics, natural sciences, engineering, and architecture. There are schools of aerospace engineering and of library science.
