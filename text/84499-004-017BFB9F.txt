Effigy mound, earthen mound in the form of an animal or bird found throughout the north-central United States. Prehistoric Native Americans built a variety of earth berm structures in addition to effigy mounds, including conical, linear, and flat-topped mounds.
Although other mound forms preceded them in time, the first effigy mounds were built about ad 300; in some places people continued to build them as late as the mid-1600s. Explorers such as Hernando de Soto (1539â€“42) recorded, for example, that flat-topped mounds in the southeastern United States served as earthen platforms on which the native people built their temples and sometimes the houses of their chiefs.
