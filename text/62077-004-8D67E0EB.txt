Baker prepared at private schools for Vassar College, but the death of her father put that school out of reach. She decided to study medicine and after a year of private preparation entered the Women’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary in New York City. After graduating in 1898 she interned at the New England Hospital for Women and Children and then entered private practice in New York City.
