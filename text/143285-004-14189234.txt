CryoSat, also called CryoSat-2,  European Space Agency satellite designed to study the effect of climate change on ice in Earthâ€™s polar regions. It launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2010, on a Russian Dnepr launch vehicle. CryoSat circles Earth in a polar orbit. Its primary instrument is the SAR Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL), which is designed to measure changes in the height of ice of less than 1 cm (0.4 inch) per year. (SAR stands for Synthetic Aperture Radar, a technique that uses short radar bursts to make an image.) The CryoSat mission will include up to six months of testing the satellite and three subsequent years of Earth observations. By measuring ice over a three-year period, CryoSat will enable scientists to determine the rate at which climate change is affecting the amount of land and sea ice. The first satellite in the CryoSat series was destroyed during a launch malfunction on October 8, 2005.
