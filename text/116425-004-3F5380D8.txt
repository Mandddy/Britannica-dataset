Scaup, also called Bluebill,   (genus Aythya), any of three species of diving ducks (family Anatidae). The greater scaup (A. marila), also called the big bluebill, breeds across Eurasia and most of the Nearctic region. The lesser scaup (A. affinis), a New World species also known as the little bluebill, breeds across the northwest quadrant of North America. In the New World both species winter along the coasts of the United States; the lesser scaup reaches central Mexico. Both popular game birds, these two species are very hard to differentiate in the field. Both are about 38–51 cm (15–20 inches) long. Males have dark breasts and grayish backs; the head of the greater scaup is dark green, that of the lesser scaup is glossed with purple but may have tinges of green. Females are brown with white patches around their blue bills. The diet is composed mainly of clams. The third species is the New Zealand scaup (A. novaeseelandiae). In flight, the white stripe on the rear of the wing extends almost to the wingtip in the greater scaup and only halfway in the lesser scaup.
