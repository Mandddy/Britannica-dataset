Hud, America film drama, released in 1963, that presented a raw and contemporary take on the western and featured Paul Newman as perhaps the most unsympathetic character he ever played.
The movie—based on Larry McMurtry’s novel Horseman, Pass By (1961)—centres on Hud Bannon (played by Newman), a brash, womanizing, self-centred manipulator who is anxious to control his aging father’s cattle empire. In the course of his efforts, Hud both charms and alienates the tough-as-nails housekeeper, Alma (Patricia Neal), and his nephew, Lon (Brandon deWilde), who idolizes him.
