Waffle,  crisp raised cake baked in a waffle iron, a hinged metal griddle with a honeycombed or fancifully engraved surface that allows a thin layer of batter to cook evenly and crisply. Baking powder is the typical leavening in American waffles, and yeast waffles are eaten in Belgium and France. In the United States and Canada waffles are a popular breakfast food, topped with butter and maple syrup or fruit preserves. Waffles also can serve as a base for savoury mixtures such as seafood or poultry in sauce. In Belgium waffles are a popular snack food. They are mentioned in French poems from as early as the 12th century, when they were sold as street food at fairs and religious festivals.
