Fallout, deposition of radioactive materials on Earth from the atmosphere. The terms rain out and snow out are sometimes used to specify such deposition during precipitant weather.
Radioactivity in the atmosphere may arise from (1) natural causes, (2) nuclear or thermonuclear bomb explosions, and (3) induced radioactivities and fission products from atomic reactor operations.
