Indianapolis 500, byname Indy 500,  U.S. automobile race held annually from 1911, except for the war years 1917–18 and 1942–45. The race is always run at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, a suburban enclave of Indianapolis, Indiana. Drawing crowds of several hundred thousand people, the race is among the world’s best-attended single-day sporting events. It is held on the weekend of the country’s Memorial Day holiday.
Indianapolis Motor Speedway was built in 1909 as a testing facility for the local automotive industry. The track was first paved with crushed rock and tar but was soon repaved with brick; hence, the speedway is often called the “Brickyard.” Resurfacing with asphalt has covered all but a 36-inch (91-cm) strip of bricks at the start/finish line. The 2.5-mile (4-km) track has two 3,300-foot (1,000-metre) straightaways, two 660-foot (200-metre) straightaways, and four quarter-mile (400-metre) turns each banked at an angle of about 9 degrees. The speedway is also home to a 400-mile (644-km) stock-car race each August.
