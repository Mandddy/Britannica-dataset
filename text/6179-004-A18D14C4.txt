Bagworm moth (family Psychidae), any of a family of insects (order Lepidoptera) that are found worldwide and named for the baglike cases the larvae construct around themselves. The bag ranges in size from 6 to 152 mm (0.25 to 6 inches) and is constructed from silk and bits of leaves, twigs, and other debris. It is also used as a pupal case.
The strong-bodied male has broad, fringed wings with a wingspread averaging 25 mm (1 inch). The wormlike female lacks wings and, in most species, remains in her bag during mating, where she will also later deposit her eggs. Female evergreen bagworms (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) lay their eggs within their bags and then crawl out of the bags and fall to the ground, where they die. Bagworm larvae are often destructive to trees, especially evergreens.
