Zodiacal light, band of light in the night sky, thought to be sunlight reflected from cometary dust concentrated in the plane of the zodiac, or ecliptic. The light is seen in the west after twilight and in the east before dawn, being easily visible in the tropics where the ecliptic is approximately vertical. In mid-northern latitudes it is best seen in the evening in February and March and in the morning in September and October.
The zodiacal light can be followed visually along the ecliptic from a point 30° from the Sun to about 90°. Photometric measurements indicate that the band continues to the region opposite the Sun where a slight enhancement called the gegenschein, or counterglow, is visible. There is some zodiacal light in all parts of the sky; it can be considered an extension of the F-corona of the Sun.
