James Thomson, pseudonym Bysshe Vanolis, or B.V.  (born Nov. 23, 1834, Port Glasgow, Renfrew, Scot.—died  June 3, 1882, London) Scottish Victorian poet who is best remembered for his sombre, imaginative poem “The City of Dreadful Night,” a symbolic expression of his horror of urban dehumanization.
Reared in an orphanage, Thomson entered the Royal Military Academy, Chelsea, became a regimental schoolmaster, and in 1851 was sent to Ireland. There he met the freethinker and radical Charles Bradlaugh, who was to be of great importance to his literary career.
