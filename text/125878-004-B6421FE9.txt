Atlas, plural Atlantes,  in architecture, male figure used as a column to support an entablature, balcony, or other projection, originating in the Classical architecture of antiquity. Such figures are posed as if supporting great weights (e.g., Atlas bearing the world). The related telamon of Roman architecture, the male counterpart of the caryatid, is also a weight-bearing figure but does not usually appear in an atlas pose.
The earliest known examples of true atlantes occur on a colossal scale in the Greek temple of Zeus (c. 500 bc) at Agrigentum (Agrigento), Sicily. Atlantes were used only rarely in the Middle Ages but reappeared in the Mannerist and Baroque periods.
