Bernhard Kellermann,  (born March 4, 1879, Fürth, Germany—died October 17, 1951, Potsdam, East Germany) German journalist and writer best known for his novel Der Tunnel (1913; The Tunnel, 1915), a sensational technical-utopian work about the construction of a tunnel between Europe and North America.
Kellermann was a painter before he turned to writing. His early novels, Yester und Li (1904), Ingeborg (1906), and Der Tor (1909; The Fool), were written in the Neo-Romantic Impressionist manner. The renowned Tunnel was followed by Der 9. November (1921; The Ninth of November), inspired by revolutionary activity in Germany in 1918; Das blaue Band (1938; “The Blue Band”), based on the sinking of the ocean liner Titanic; and Totentanz (1948; “Dance of Death”).
