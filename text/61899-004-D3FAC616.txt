Flannery O’Connor, in full Mary Flannery O’Connor  (born March 25, 1925, Savannah, Georgia, U.S.—died August 3, 1964, Milledgeville, Georgia) American novelist and short-story writer whose works, usually set in the rural American South and often treating of alienation, are concerned with the relationship between the individual and God.
O’Connor grew up in a prominent Roman Catholic family in her native Georgia. She lived in Savannah until her adolescence, but the worsening of her father’s lupus erythematosus forced the family to relocate in 1938 to the home in rural Milledgeville where her mother had been raised. After graduating from Georgia State College for Women (now Georgia College &amp; State University) in 1945, she studied creative writing at the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop.
