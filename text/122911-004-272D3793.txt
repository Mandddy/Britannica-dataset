Tiger snake (genus Notechis), Australian member of the cobra family, Elapidae. The snakeâ€™s venom, which contains a blood-clotting agent as well as a nerve paralyzer, is potentially fatal to humans. Before striking, the tiger snake flattens its head and neck, cobra fashion.
Tiger snakes occur in moist areas and in dry, rocky habitats of southern Australia and adjacent islands. They are represented by a variety of distinct populations that probably correspond to two, or perhaps more, species. The eastern tiger snake (N. scutatus) is the most widely distributed form, occurring from Victoria and New South Wales to portions of South and Western Australia. The black tiger snake (N. ater) is mainly limited to arid and rocky regions in South Australia. Tiger snakes eat frogs, birds, and mammals, and all attain adult lengths of 1 to 1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet). They are live-bearers.
