Imatinib, also called STI571,  anticancer drug used primarily in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Imatinib was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2001 under the trade name Gleevec for the treatment of CML. The following year it was approved for the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), which are rare cancers affecting interstitial cells that regulate the autonomic nervous function of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical trials investigating the efficacy of imatinib against other types of cancers are ongoing.
Imatinib is designed to target abnormal proteins that promote the growth and survival of cancer cells and that are unique to these cells. This differs from traditional anticancer agents, which act on general mechanisms controlling cell replication or programmed cell death (apoptosis) and which do not differentiate between cancer cells and normal cells. Imatinib is highly effective—the five-year survival rate for previously untreated CML patients is nearly 90 percent. Imatinib’s success clinically has come to represent an important milestone in the advancement of cancer treatment, since it demonstrated that targeted therapies could be more effective and safer than traditional nonselective anticancer agents. Imatinib served as a model for the subsequent development of other selective anticancer drugs, which as a group are known as targeted therapies.
