Diana Vishneva,  (born July 13, 1976, Leningrad, U.S.S.R. [now St. Petersburg, Russia]) Russian ballerina who dazzled audiences worldwide with the musicality, flamboyance, and technical brilliance of her performances and brought a modern physicality and energy to her expansive repertoire.
Vishneva applied unsuccessfully at age nine to the Vaganova Ballet Academy in Leningrad, where renowned dancers Natalia Makarova, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov had studied. The rejection only spurred Vishnevaâ€™s ambition, and two years later the academy accepted her. At age 17 she won the rarely awarded gold medal at the 1994 Prix de Lausanne international ballet competition. Nonetheless, she turned down the prize, which would have enabled her to study for a year at an international ballet school of her choosing, and returned to her studies at the Vaganova school.
