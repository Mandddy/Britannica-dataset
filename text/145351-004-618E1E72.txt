Loíza River, Spanish Río Grande De Loíza,  river in eastern Puerto Rico, rising in the Sierra de Cayey south of San Lorenzo. Flowing about 40 miles (65 km) between the humid foothills of the Cayey and the Sierra de Luquillo, it emerges through swamps to empty into the Atlantic Ocean near Loíza Aldea. In its floodplain and on the surrounding terraces, sugarcane, tobacco, bananas, and vegetables are grown. In 1948 the Loíza River Project was initiated with the construction of a hydroelectric dam just south of Trujillo Alto. Its reservoir, Embalse de Loíza, is the major source of San Juan’s water supply. The last 8 miles (13 km) of the river from Santa Bárbara have been straightened and made navigable.
