Crown vetch (Securigera varia), also called purple crown vetch,  vigorous trailing plant of the pea family (Fabaceae), widely grown in temperate areas as a ground cover. Crown vetch is native to the Mediterranean region and has naturalized in many places; it is considered an invasive species in parts of the United States. The varieties Securigera varia ‘Penngift,’ ‘Emerald,’ and ‘Chemung’ are common ornamentals and feature dense deep-green foliage with large attractive flower clusters.
Crown vetch has compound fernlike leaves with 15–25 leaflets and clusters of white to pink or purple flowers. The sturdy roots and rhizomes (underground stems) are useful in binding the soil of steep slopes and roadside embankments. The stems lack tendrils, which distinguishes the plant from true vetches (genus Vicia). The plant dies back to the crown each fall in cold areas, resuming growth in spring; quick growth of the plant is encouraged by cutting it back in the fall or early spring. As a legume, crown vetch utilizes a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its roots to draw nitrogen from the air and convert it into a usable form, thus improving soil fertility.
