Gabrielle Giffords, in full Gabrielle Dee Giffords  (born June 8, 1970, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.) American Democratic politician who served in the U.S. House of Representatives (2007–12). In January 2011 she was the victim of an assassination attempt.
Giffords grew up in Tucson and attended Scripps College in Claremont, California, where in 1993 she received a B.A. in sociology and Latin American history. After studying in Chihuahua, Mexico, on a Fulbright scholarship and completing a master’s degree in regional planning from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Giffords took a position as an associate at an accounting firm in New York City. She returned to Tucson shortly thereafter to become, in 1997, president and CEO of her family’s business, El Campo Tire Warehouses. Three years later she sold the company and was elected to the Arizona state legislature as a Democrat. (Although she had been inspired by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor to register as a Republican at age 18, Giffords switched her affiliation in 1999 after realizing that her views on social issues were more in line with the Democratic Party.) She later served in the state Senate (2003–05) before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives amid a wave of Democratic victories in 2006.
