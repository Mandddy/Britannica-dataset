Offshoring, the practice of outsourcing operations overseas, usually by companies from industrialized countries to less-developed countries, with the intention of reducing the cost of doing business. Chief among the specific reasons for locating operations outside a corporationâ€™s home country are lower labour costs, more lenient environmental regulations, less stringent labour regulations, favourable tax conditions, and proximity to raw materials.
The offshoring of jobs and infrastructure became a significant factor in global economic development in the mid-20th century. Companies initially focused their outsourcing efforts on low-skilled or unskilled manufacturing jobs and simple assembly tasks (see maquiladora). By the early 21st century, however, the work being exported increasingly included skilled jobs. As communications technologies advanced and educational opportunities increased, many developing countries were able to provide sophisticated labour forces. Corporations around the world began tapping these new workers to staff customer-call centres and to fill jobs in financial management and information technology (IT). In countries such as India, the Philippines, and Malaysia, a growing pool of university graduates in technology quickly became capable of managing complex tasks that included software engineering, computer chip design, and code writing.
