McGill University,  private state-supported English-language university in Montreal that is internationally known for its work in chemistry, medicine, and biology. A bequest from the estate of James McGill, a Montreal merchant, was used to found the university, which received a royal charter in 1821. Faculties of medicine and arts were the first to be established, and in 1899 Royal Victoria College was opened for women. Royal Victoria gradually merged with McGill and the university is now completely coeducational. Also incorporated in the university system is Macdonald College at Sainte-Anne de Bellevue, founded in 1907 and specializing in the agricultural sciences. Three theological colleges are also affiliated with the university. McGill is one of the leading universities of Canada.
