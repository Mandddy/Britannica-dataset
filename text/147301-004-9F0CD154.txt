Waveguide, any of a class of devices that confines and directs the propagation of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, infrared rays, and visible light. Waveguides take many shapes and forms. Typical examples include hollow metallic tubes, coaxial cables, and optical fibres.
Hollow metallic tubes or ducts of rectangular cross section are among the simplest and most commonly used waveguides. They are employed, for example, between a radio transmitter (or receiver) and its antenna. Circular metallic tubes are appropriate for such applications as radar in which two sections of the waveguide must rotate with respect to one another. In either type of configuration, radio waves are confined to the interior of the tube so as to minimize the loss of the radio-frequency power passing through it.
