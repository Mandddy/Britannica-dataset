Regiomontanus, Latin name of Johannes Müller von Königsberg  (born June 6, 1436, Königsberg, archbishopric of Mainz [Germany]—died July 6, 1476, Rome, Papal States [Italy]) the foremost mathematician and astronomer of 15th-century Europe, a sought-after astrologer, and one of the first printers.
Königsberg means “King’s Mountain,” which is what the Latinized version of his name, Joannes de Regio monte or Regiomontanus, also means. A miller’s son, he entered the University of Leipzig at the age of 11 and in 1450 went to the University of Vienna. Regiomontanus was awarded a baccalaureate in 1452, but university regulations forced him to wait until he turned 21 to receive his master’s degree. He eventually collaborated with his teacher, the mathematician-astronomer Georg von Peuerbach (d. 1461), on various astronomical and astrological projects, including observations of eclipses and comets, the manufacture of astronomical instruments, and the casting of horoscopes for the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III.
