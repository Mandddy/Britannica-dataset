Carl Schurz,  (born March 2, 1829, Liblar, near Cologne, Prussia [now in Germany]â€”died  May 14, 1906, New York, N.Y., U.S.) German-American political leader, journalist, orator, and dedicated reformer who pressed for high moral standards in government in a period of notorious public laxity.
As a student at the University of Bonn, Schurz participated in the abortive German revolution of 1848, was imprisoned, escaped, and eventually came to the United States (1852). He settled in Wisconsin (1856), quickly became active in the antislavery movement, and, as a delegate to the Republican National Convention of 1860, worked for the nomination of Abraham Lincoln for president.
