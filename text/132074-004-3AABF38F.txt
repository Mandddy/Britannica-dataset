Thermistor,  electrical-resistance element made of a semiconducting material consisting of a mixture of oxides of manganese and nickel; its resistance varies with temperature. Thermistors (temperature-sensitive, or thermal, resistors) are used as temperature-measuring devices and in electrical circuits to compensate for temperature variations of other components. They are also used to measure radio-frequency power and radiant power, such as infrared and visible light.
