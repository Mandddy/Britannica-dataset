Topographic map, cartographic representation of the Earthâ€™s surface at a level of detail or scale intermediate between that of a plan (small area) and a chorographic (large regional) map. Within the limits of scale, it shows as accurately as possible the location and shape of both natural and man-made features. Natural features include relief, which is sometimes mistakenly understood to be the sole feature characterizing a topographic map, and hydrographic features, such as lakes and rivers; man-made features include other characteristics of the subject area, such as cities, towns, and villages, and roads, railroads, canals, dams, bridges, tunnels, parks, and other features. International usage of the term varies; in the United States, for example, the term topographic is often limited to maps at scales of 1:500,000 or larger; in Russia, to scales of 1:1,000,000 or larger.
