Imelda Marcos, in full Imelda Romuáldez Marcos, née Imelda Remedios Visitacion Romuáldez  (born July 2, 1929, Manila, Philippines) public figure in the Philippines who wielded great power during the 20-year rule of her husband, Pres. Ferdinand Marcos.
The woman who would become known as the “Steel Butterfly” for her combination of fashion sense and political resolve was born Imelda Romuáldez. Her mother died when she was eight years old, and her father, saddled with a failing law practice and mounting expenses, soon relocated the family from Manila to Tacloban. She was dubbed the “Rose of Tacloban” as the winner of a local beauty contest in 1949, and she graduated from Tacloban’s St. Paul’s College with a degree in education in 1952. That year she returned to a Manila that was buzzing with post-World War II construction, a city greatly changed from the city she had known as a child. Romuáldez caught the eye of many among Manila’s business and political elites, including the mayor, who in 1953 declared her the “Muse of Manila,” resulting in her picture appearing frequently in newspapers and magazines thereafter.
