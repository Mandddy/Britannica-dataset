Eugène Scribe, in full Augustin-Eugène Scribe   (born Dec. 24, 1791, Paris, France—died  Feb. 20, 1861, Paris) French dramatist whose works dominated the Parisian stage for more than 30 years.
Scribe began his career as a playwright by resurrecting the vaudeville, an obsolete form of short satirical comedy that used rhymed and sung couplets and featured musical interludes. He soon began replacing its stock characters with ones drawn from contemporary society and introducing elements of the comedy of manners into his plays. He eliminated the musical interludes altogether and expanded the elements of comic intrigue until his plays had become genuine comedies. He went on to become one of the great masters of the neatly plotted, tightly constructed well-made play.
