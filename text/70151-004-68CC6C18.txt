Somaliland, historically, the area now comprising Somalia and Djibouti. The name is also used to refer to the Republic of Somaliland, a self-declared independent country in the Horn of Africa.
The region probably formed part of the “Land of Punt” known to the ancient Egyptians. Between the 7th and the 12th century ce, cities such as Seylac and Berbera on the Gulf of Aden and Marka, Baraawe, and Mogadishu along the Indian Ocean served as trading ports in a region that the Arab Islamic world called bilad al-Barbar (“country of the Barbar”), Barbar (also Berber, Barbaroi) being a name for the Somali people of the region based on the descriptions of the inhabitants of the area found in the Greek document Periplus Maris Erythraei (1st century ce; “Navigation of the Erythrean [i.e., Red] Sea”). Those medieval cities exported gums and resins, ostrich feathers, and slaves and waged war against the Christian Ethiopians of the interior. The Somali, who occupied those areas alongside other groups, had begun adopting Islam in the 7th century, and the religion became firmly entrenched in the centuries that followed. The occupants of the cities organized themselves into sultanates such as Adal, centred at Seylac, and Ajuran, centred at Mogadishu.
