Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, murderous attack on Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on the evening of April 14, 1865. Shot in the head by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln died the next morning. The assassination occurred only days after the surrender at Appomattox Court House of Gen. Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia to Union forces led by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, which had signaled the effective end of the American Civil War. Lincoln’s death plunged much of the country into despair, and the search for Booth and his accomplices was the largest manhunt in American history to that date.
Booth was a member of one of America’s most renowned families of actors. His brother Edwin Booth was widely regarded as the country’s leading actor, a mantle he had inherited from their father, Junius Brutus Booth, and John Wilkes Booth was an acclaimed performer in his own right, celebrated for his charisma, athleticism, and dashing good looks. He grew up in the border state of Maryland but was particularly popular as an actor in Richmond, Va., and considered himself a Southerner. Moreover, he passionately advocated the slave system. Having promised his mother that he would not fight for the Confederacy, Booth remained in the North during the Civil War, and his hatred of abolitionists and Lincoln deepened. In March 1865 he and a group of conspirators in Washington, D.C., plotted to abduct Lincoln, though none of those plans came to fruition.
