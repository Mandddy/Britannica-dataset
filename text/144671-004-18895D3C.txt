Ravi River, in northwestern India and northeastern Pakistan, one of the five tributaries of the Indus River that give the Punjab (meaning “Five Rivers”) its name. It rises in the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh state, India, and flows west-northwest past Chamba, turning southwest at the boundary of Jammu and Kashmir state. The river then flows to the Pakistani border and along it for more than 50 miles (80 km) before entering Pakistan’s Punjab province. It flows past Lahore and turns west near Kamalia, emptying into the Chenab River south of Ahmadpur Sial after a course of about 450 miles (725 km).
The hydrology of the Ravi is controlled by spring snowmelt and the South Asian monsoon that brings heavy rains from June to September. The Ravi has had flood discharges in excess of 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 cubic metres) per second during the summer monsoon season, but during the winter the flow is substantially reduced, together with the suspended sediment load.
