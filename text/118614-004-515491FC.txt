Waterford, Irish Port Láirge,  county in the province of Munster, southern Ireland. It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the south and from west to east by Counties Cork, Tipperary, Kilkenny, and Wexford. The county’s northern boundary follows the River Suir through the city of Waterford. Dungarvan, on Dungarvan Harbour, is the county town (seat).
Included within the county are the lower reaches of the Rivers Blackwater and Bride. The upland areas of Waterford are mainly ridges 600 to 800 feet (180 to 240 metres) high, grading into lowlands and marked by ranges of mountains, principally the Knockmealdowns, Comeraghs, and Monavullaghs, all reaching elevations of about 2,300 feet (700 metres). The Comeraghs and Monavullaghs make up a single range that includes Coumshingaun, a steep-walled basin, or cirque, with sides 1,000 feet (300 metres) high. To the east of the Comeraghs the older rocks form a lowland surrounded by sharp hills drained by the River Clodiagh. Most of the coast is cliff, though there are bays at Tramore, Dungarvan, and Ardmore.
