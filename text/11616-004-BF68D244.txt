Évariste Galois,  (born October 25, 1811, Bourg-la-Reine, near Paris, France—died May 31, 1832, Paris) French mathematician famous for his contributions to the part of higher algebra now known as group theory. His theory provided a solution to the long-standing question of determining when an algebraic equation can be solved by radicals (a solution containing square roots, cube roots, and so on but no trigonometry functions or other nonalgebraic functions).
Galois was the son of Nicolas-Gabriel Galois, an important citizen in the Paris suburb of Bourg-la-Reine. In 1815, during the Hundred Days regime that followed Napoleon’s escape from Elba, his father was elected mayor. Galois was educated at home until 1823, when he entered the Collège Royal de Louis-le-Grand. There his education languished at the hands of mediocre and uninspiring teachers. But his mathematical ability blossomed when he began to study the works of his countrymen Adrien-Marie Legendre on geometry and Joseph-Louis Lagrange on algebra.
