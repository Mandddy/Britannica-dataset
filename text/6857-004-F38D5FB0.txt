Briard, French sheepdog breed mentioned in French records of the 12th century and depicted in medieval French tapestries. It is known in France as berger de Brie (sheepdog of Brie) but is found throughout the French provinces. The briard is a lithe, strongly built dog with bushy brows and a long, more-or-less waterproof coat. It stands 22 to 27 inches (56 to 68.5 cm), weighs about 80 pounds (36 kg), and is usually black, gray, or tawny. Briards are also used for guard, police, and military work.
