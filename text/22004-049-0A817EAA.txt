Flagellum, plural flagella,  hairlike structure that acts primarily as an organelle of locomotion in the cells of many living organisms. Flagella, characteristic of the protozoan group Mastigophora, also occur on the gametes of algae, fungi, mosses, slime molds, and animals. Flagellar motion causes water currents necessary for respiration and circulation in sponges and coelenterates. Most motile bacteria move by means of flagella.
The structures and pattern of movement of prokaryotic and eukaryotic flagella are different. Eukaryotes have one to many flagella, which move in a characteristic whiplike manner. The flagella closely resemble the cilium in structure. The core is a bundle of nine pairs of microtubules surrounding two central pairs of microtubules (the so-called nine-plus-two arrangement); each microtubule is composed of the protein tubulin. The coordinated sliding of these microtubules confers movement. The base of the flagellum is anchored to the cell by a basal body.
