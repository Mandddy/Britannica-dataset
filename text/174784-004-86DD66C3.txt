High Sierra, American crime film, released in 1941, that is noted for Humphrey Bogart’s sympathetic portrayal of an aging criminal.
Bogart played Roy (“Mad Dog”) Earle, who is paroled from prison as part of a scheme to rob a hotel in California. He travels to a cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains, where an eclectic group of confederates—including Marie (played by Ida Lupino), one of the criminals’ girlfriends—are waiting. The heist goes awry, and several robbers are killed. Pursued by the police, Earle orders Marie away, hoping to protect her. He returns to the Sierras, where he meets his tragic end.
