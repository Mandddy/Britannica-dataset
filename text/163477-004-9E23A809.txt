Corrado Alvaro,  (born April 15, 1895, San Luca, Italy—died June 11, 1956, Rome) Italian novelist and journalist whose works investigated the social and political pressures of life in the 20th century. His works were often set in Calabria, southern Italy.
Alvaro began his career as a writer in 1916, working on daily newspapers in Bologna and Milan. Military service in World War I temporarily interrupted his studies at the University of Milan. After graduation he worked for several journals—including the antifascist weekly Il Mondo (1920–30; “The World”)—and traveled throughout Europe. Indicative of his own work, he described Italian writing after World War II as “a literature of tensions.”
