Western Dvina River, Russian Zapadnaya Dvina, Lettish Daugava, Belarusian Dzvina,  major river of Latvia and northern Belarus. It rises in the Valdai Hills and flows 632 miles (1,020 km) in a great arc south and southwest through Russia and Belarus and then turns northwest prior to crossing Latvia. It discharges into the Gulf of Riga on the Baltic Sea. Its tributaries include the Mezha, Kasplya, Ula, and Dzisna entering from the left and the Toropa, Drysa, Aiviekste (with its tributary the Pededze), and Ogre entering from the right.
The Western Dvina drains an area of approximately 34,000 square miles (88,000 square km). Most of the river basin is between 300 and 700 feet (100 and 200 m) above sea level—a rolling plain with numerous swamps and forests. The basin also has more than 5,000 lakes, most quite small. Among the larger are lakes Rezna and Lubana, in Latvia; Zhizhitsa, in the river’s upper reaches; Osveya and Drysvyaty, in the middle part of the basin on the border of Belarus and Latvia; and Lukoml, in the southernmost part. The basin has a humid climate with warm summers and mild winters.
