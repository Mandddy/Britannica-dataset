Trained in the United States, Manship received a scholarship in 1909 to study at the American Academy in Rome. He traveled extensively through Italy and Greece and discovered a deep appreciation for archaic Greek statues and for Assyrian, Egyptian, and Minoan art. These ancient sources would influence his work for the remainder of his career. After three years abroad he settled in New York City and developed a style that rejected the Beaux Arts naturalism that was then fashionable.
