Carlotta Grisi, in full Caronna Adela Giuseppina Maria Grisi  (born June 28, 1819, Visinada, Istria, Austrian Empire [now Vizinada, Croatia]—died May 29, 1899, Saint-Jean, near Geneva, Switzerland) Italian ballerina of the Romantic era who was a muse to the choreographer and dancer Jules Perrot and to the poet Théophile Gautier; she created the title role in Giselle.
A cousin of the celebrated opera singer Giulia Grisi, Carlotta Grisi received her early training at the ballet school of La Scala in Milan. Her family was poor, and at age 10 she was withdrawn from the school to join a touring opera company. In 1834 she entered the ballet company of the San Carlo, Naples; there she attracted the attention of Jules Perrot, who molded her into a ballerina of exquisite sensitivity. Their visit to London in 1836 was followed by a longer engagement in Vienna. In 1840 they appeared—she as Madame Perrot, although they were never married—at a minor Paris theatre in a light opera, Zingaro. Perrot’s plan was to negotiate a joint engagement at the Paris Opéra, but it was Grisi alone who was engaged.
