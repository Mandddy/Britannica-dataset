Cyclo-cross,  cross-country bicycle racing in open and usually quite rough country with riders often forced to dismount and carry their bicycles.
The sport originated early in the 20th century in France, but it eventually became popular throughout western Europe and in the United States. World championships were initiated in 1925; by 1950 these were recognized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI; International Cyclistsâ€™ Union). After 1967 amateur and professional classes were officially separated in competition.
