The son of John White Alexander, an American painter who created murals for the Library of Congress, James studied mathematics and physics at Princeton University, obtaining a B.S. degree in 1910 and an M.S. degree the following year. For the next few years he traveled and studied in Europe before submitting his doctoral dissertation (1915) to Princeton, where he taught until the United States’ entry into World War I in 1917. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army and served at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Alexander returned to Princeton in 1920, where he remained until 1933 when he joined the newly created Institute for Advanced Studies, a research institution spun off from Princeton. He remained with the institute until his retirement in 1951. Alexander also worked as a civilian consultant for the Army during World War II.
