Volker Schlöndorff,  (born March 31, 1939, Wiesbaden, Germany) motion-picture director, member of the postwar cinema movement in West Germany.
Schlöndorff studied filmmaking in Paris, serving as an assistant to directors Louis Malle, Alain Resnais, and Jean-Pierre Melville. After directing several projects for French television in the early 1960s, he returned to Germany and joined the burgeoning Junger Deutscher (Young German) film movement. His first feature, Der junge Törless (1966; Young Törless), an adaptation of the Robert Musil novella Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless, earned him instant recognition. This study of a sensitive boy in a brutal German military academy exhibited the cool, straightforward directorial style that would come to distinguish Schlöndorff from his more idiosyncratic contemporaries Werner Herzog and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.
