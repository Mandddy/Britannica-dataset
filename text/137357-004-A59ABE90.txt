Sausage tree, (Kigelia africana), tropical tree, the only species of its genus (family Bignoniaceae). It grows 6 to 12 metres (20 to 40 feet) tall and bears sausagelike fruits, 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 feet) long, which hang down on long, cordlike stalks. It is native to Africa.
The treeâ€™s flowers, about 10 cm (4 inches) wide, are purplish green in colour and are slightly irregular in shape or bent to one side. They are produced on old wood and so hang that they can be easily visited by bats, the principal pollinators. The flowers do not bloom until nightfall, when they emit a mouselike odour, and bats visit them for nectar and pollen. By morning the flowers have fallen.
