Biopsy, medical diagnostic procedure in which cells or tissues are removed from a patient and examined visually, usually with a microscope. The material for the biopsy may be obtained by several methods and with various instruments, including aspiration through a needle, swabbing with a sponge, scraping with a curette, trephining a bone, or excision with forceps or an electric snare. The biopsy is a standard step in the diagnosis of both malignant and benign tumours and can also provide a wide range of other types of diagnostic information, particularly in connection with certain organs, such as the liver or the pancreas.
The tissue collected during a biopsy is fixed in ethanol, formalin, or another suitable fixative, infiltrated with paraffin, and sectioned into very thin slices, which are placed on glass slides. The tissue is deparaffinized and stained to define the cellular characteristics. This allows the surgical pathologist to examine the tissue with a microscope and render a precise diagnosis. During surgery, tissue samples can be immediately frozen, and slices made with a microtome can be placed on a glass slide and rapidly stained. The surgeon is then given a “frozen section” report within minutes.
