John Knudsen Northrop,  (born Nov. 10, 1895, Newark, N.J., U.S.â€”died  Feb. 18, 1981, Glendale, Calif.) American aircraft designer, an early advocate of all-metal construction and the flying wing design.
Northrop graduated from high school in 1913 and in 1916 became a draftsman and designer for the Lockheed (formerly Loughead) brothers, builders of seaplanes and sport biplanes in Santa Barbara, Calif. From 1923 to 1927 he designed fuel tanks for the Douglas Aircraft Company in Santa Monica, and then he joined Allan Lockheed as chief engineer for the Lockheed Aircraft Company, Hollywood. There he designed and built the Vega, a high-wing monoplane noted for its plywood fuselage of monocoque, or stressed-skin, construction, in which the plywood sheath, rather than heavy internal trusses, provided the structural support.
