Parrot fish, any of about 80 species of fishes of the family Scaridae, a group sometimes regarded as a subfamily of Labridae (order Perciformes), found on tropical reefs. Parrot fishes are elongated, usually rather blunt-headed and deep-bodied, and often very brightly coloured. They have large scales and a characteristic birdlike beak formed by the fused teeth of the jaws. The beak is used to scrape algae and the soft part of coral from coral reefs and is strong enough to leave noticeable scars in the coral. The fish grind their food and bits of coral with platelike teeth in their throats.
Parrot fishes range to a length of about 1.2 metres (4 feet) and weight of about 20 kilograms (45 pounds), or occasionally larger. They are variable in colour, the male of a species often differing considerably from the female, and the young may differ from the adult. Parrot fishes are protogynous hermaphrodites; that is, they first function as females and later transform into males.
