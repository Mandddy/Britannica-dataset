Barbara Jordan, in full Barbara Charline Jordan  (born February 21, 1936, Houston, Texas, U.S.—died January 17, 1996, Austin, Texas) American lawyer, educator, and politician who served as U.S. congressional representative from Texas (1973–79). She was the first African American congresswoman to come from the South.
Jordan was the youngest of three daughters in a close-knit family. As a high school student, she became a skilled public speaker, winning a national debate contest in 1952. She attended Texas Southern University in Houston, becoming a member of the debate team that tied Harvard University in a debate—one of her proudest college moments. Following graduation (magna cum laude in 1956), she attended Boston University Law School, where she was one of only two women—both African Americans from Houston—to graduate. She passed the Massachusetts bar exam but moved to Tuskegee Institute (later renamed Tuskegee University) in Alabama and taught there for one year before returning to Texas and gaining admittance to the bar there.
