Sir Frank Benson, in full Sir Frank Robert Benson   (born Nov. 4, 1858, Alresford, Hampshire, Eng.—died Dec. 31, 1939, London) British actor-manager whose touring company and acting school were important influences on contemporary theatre.
While at New College, Oxford, Benson produced Agamemnon, the first play to be performed there in the original Greek. In 1882 he made his first professional appearance at the Lyceum Theatre, London—then under the management of Sir Henry Irving—playing the role of Paris in Romeo and Juliet. The next year he formed a company of his own. In 1886 he married Gertrude Constance Featherstonhaugh (1860–1946), who acted in his company and played leading parts with him. Benson continued to appear in London and regularly toured the English provinces in Shakespearean roles, and he also performed in Canada (1913) and South Africa (1921). He is remembered for his performances of Hamlet, Coriolanus, Richard II, Lear, and Petruchio.
