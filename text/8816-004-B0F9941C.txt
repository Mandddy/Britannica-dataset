Giacomo da Vignola, also called Giacomo Barozzi or Giacomo Barozio  (born Oct. 1, 1507, Vignola, Bologna [Italy]—died  July 7, 1573, Rome) architect who, with Andrea Palladio and Giulio Romano, dominated Italian Mannerist architectural design and stylistically anticipated the Baroque.
After studying in Bologna, Vignola went to Rome in the 1530s and made drawings of the antiquities for a projected edition of Vitruvius’ treatise on architecture. In 1541–43 he spent 18 months at the court of Francis I at Fontainebleau and in Paris, where he probably met his fellow Bolognese, the architect Sebastiano Serlio and the painter Primaticcio. On his return to Italy he built the Palazzo Bocchi at Bologna and then went to Rome (c. 1550), where he was appointed architect to Pope Julius III, for whom he built the Villa Giulia in collaboration with Giorgio Vasari and Bartolommeo Ammannati, in 1551–55. This was a summer villa, based on ancient villa types as described by Pliny the Younger, with a small house and an elaborate garden.
