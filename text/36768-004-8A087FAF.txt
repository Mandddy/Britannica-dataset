Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo,  (born Nov. 3, 1856, Santander, Spain—died  May 19, 1912, Santander) Spanish literary critic and historian, remarkable for his vast erudition and his elegant and flexible prose. Although some of his judgments are no longer accepted, his studies of medieval, Renaissance, and Golden Age Spanish literature are still invaluable. The range and profundity of his knowledge enabled him to make valuable assessments of the Hispanic contribution to Western literature.
He was professor of Spanish literature at Madrid (1878–98) and director of the Biblioteca Nacional (1898–1912); his private library (of 45,000 volumes), which he bequeathed to Santander, forms part of the Biblioteca de Menéndez y Pelayo. His works are available in the Edición nacional de las obras completas de Menéndez y Pelayo, 43 vol. (1940–46).
