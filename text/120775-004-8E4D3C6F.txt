Pterostyrax,  genus of about four species of deciduous trees or shrubs, of the storax family (Styracaceae), native to East Asia. A few species, notably P. hispidus and P. corymbosus, both of which are called the epaulette tree, are cultivated in other regions as ornamentals. The genus is characterized by alternate stalked leaves and fragrant white flowers borne in large clusters. The five petals are separate. The fleshy fruit has one or two seeds. P. hispidus grows to about 15 m (50 feet) tall, has rather oblong, finely toothed leaves that are 17–25 cm (about 7–10 inches) long, and bristly fruit with 10 ribs.
