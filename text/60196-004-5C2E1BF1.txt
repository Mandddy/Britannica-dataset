Carbonaceous chondrite, a diverse class of chondrites (one of the two divisions of stony meteorites), important because of the insights they provide into the early history of the solar system. They comprise about 3 percent of all meteorites collected after being seen to fall to Earth. Carbonaceous chondrites are subdivided into six well-established groups—CI, CM, CV, CO, CR, and CK—based on their bulk chemistry, petrology, and oxygen isotopic compositions. Two additional groups, named CH and CB, has also been tentatively identified. Like all chondrites, carbonaceous chondrites (with the exception of the CI group) are composed principally of chondrules and refractory inclusions set in a fine-grained matrix.
The name carbonaceous is something of a misnomer. This class of chondrites originally was assumed to be rich in carbonaceous material because of the gray-to-black appearance of many of its members. Although some carbonaceous chondrites contain up to 2 percent carbon by weight in organic matter, others contain less carbonaceous material than some members of other classes of chondrite. The dark appearance has more to do with the greater abundance of fine-grained matrix in them than in most chondrites. Like other chondrites, carbonaceous chondrites have experienced various degrees of aqueous alteration, thermal metamorphism, or a combination of the two. Aqueous alteration of the group known as CI chondrites was so extensive that few if any of their original features have survived. CI chondrites do not show even vestiges of chondrules. Since chondrules are considered the defining feature of chondrites, it could be argued that they are not chondrites at all; nevertheless, based on their chemistry and other features, it makes sense to group them with the chondrites.
