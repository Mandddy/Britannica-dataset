Bibliotheca Alexandrina, research institution in Alexandria, Egypt, that took its inspiration from the Library of Alexandria of Classical times.
The idea of reviving the ancient library was first proposed in 1972 by Mostafa El-Abbadi, a professor at Alexandria University. The Egyptian government decided to sponsor the project, and it received international publicity and support through UNESCO. A site was selected adjacent to Alexandria University and near the location of the ancient library.
