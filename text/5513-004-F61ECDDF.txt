Amboseli National Park, formerly Maasai Amboseli Game Reserve,  national park, southern Kenya, eastern Africa. Amboseli was originally established as a game reserve in 1948 and covered 1,259 square miles (3,261 square km) northwest of Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Within it were distinguished seven habitats: open plains, acacia woodland, lava-strewn thornbush country, swamp, marshland, the Amboseli lake bed, and the slopes of Oldoinyo Orok. Historically, the land in the reserve was home to the Maasai and their cattle herds.
In 1974 a little more than 10 percent of the reserve was established as the Amboseli National Park, with an area of 151 square miles (392 square km). Centred on Lake Amboseli, normally dry with a flat basin of alkaline soils, the park encompasses three of the original seven habitats: open plains, thornbush country, and acacia woodland. A great variety of wildlife inhabits the park. Important fauna include baboons, lions, cheetahs, elephants, black rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, Maasai giraffes, buffalo, oryx, wildebeests, gerenuk, impalas, and gazelles.
