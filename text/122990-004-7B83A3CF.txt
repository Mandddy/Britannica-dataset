Cotton rat (genus Sigmodon), any of 10 species of terrestrial rodents found from the southern United States to northern South America. Cotton rats are stout-bodied with small ears, and their coarse, grizzled coats range from grayish brown to dark brown mixed with buff. All species live in natural grassland habitats ranging from coastal marshes to mountain meadows. They also inhabit cultivated fields where grass or crops are sufficiently tall and dense to afford protection from predators. Active day and night, cotton rats use extensive surface trails through the grass that connect their fibrous nests, which they construct at the base of shrubs or in the burrows of other animals. Eating mostly plant materials, they can become serious agricultural pests, especially in plantations of sugarcane and vegetable crops.
The hispid cotton rat (S. hispidus) has the most extensive distribution, extending from the southern United States to northern South America, and the natural history of this species has been the most intensely studied. It is large, weighing up to 225 grams (7.9 ounces), with a body up to 20 cm (nearly 8 inches) long and a tail up to 13 cm long. Although grasses and forbs are their primary diet, hispid cotton rats eat insects on a seasonal basis, crayfish and fiddler crabs in coastal marshes, and sometimes eggs and chicks of the bobwhite quail. Hispid cotton rats outnumber most other small mammals in grassland and agricultural areas of the southern United States. They are prolific, producing several litters of 4 to 8 young per year, although litters of 1 to 15 have been recorded.
