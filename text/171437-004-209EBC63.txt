Francis Quarles,  (baptized May 8, 1592, Romford, Essex, England—died September 8, 1644, London) religious poet remembered for his Emblemes, the most notable emblem book in English.
The son of a minor court official, Quarles was educated at the University of Cambridge and at Lincoln’s Inn, London. The wealth of Quarles’s family at first allowed him to live a leisured and studious life, but in the late 1620s he served as secretary to Archbishop James Ussher in Ireland. In 1640 Quarles became chronologer to London, virtually abandoning poetry to employ his pen more lucratively. He died in relative poverty.
