Judith Jamison,  (born May 10, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American modern dancer who was artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (1989–2011).
Jamison began taking dance lessons at age six at the Judimar School of Dance. She left her studies at Fisk University to attend the Philadelphia Dance Academy (now the University of the Arts), where she later became a visiting distinguished professor. Discovered by Agnes de Mille, Jamison made her New York City debut with the American Ballet Theatre. She performed her debut with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company (now the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater [AAADT]) in “Conga Tango Palace” in 1965. Her height (5 feet 10 inches [178 cm]) and elegant, striking presence helped make her an immediate success with the company. In 1971 Ailey choreographed Cry expressly for Jamison; a 15-minute solo depicting the struggles of black women, it became her signature piece. She performed extensively both in the United States and abroad.
