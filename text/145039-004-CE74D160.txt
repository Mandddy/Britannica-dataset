The university was established by the Methodist Church in 1859 as Valparaiso Male and Female College. Financial constraints in the wake of the American Civil War forced the school to close in 1871. It was reopened in 1873 as Northern Indiana Normal School and Business Institute by educator Henry Baker Brown, who built it into a school of national repute. Engineering courses began in 1873, and four-year engineering programs were instituted in 1920. Renamed Valparaiso College in 1900, it was elevated to university status in 1907. With 6,000 students on the rolls in 1914–15, Valparaiso was the second largest university in the United States, after Harvard University. World War I and Brown’s death in 1915 contributed to Valparaiso’s subsequent decline into bankruptcy. In 1925 it was purchased by the Lutheran University Association. Journalist and radio commentator Lowell Thomas was an alumnus of the school.
