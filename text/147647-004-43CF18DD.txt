Google Apps, free computer application service offered by the American search engine company Google Inc.
In 2006, in what many in the industry considered the opening salvo in a war with the Microsoft Corporation, Google introduced Google Apps—software hosted by Google that runs through users’ Web browsers. The first free programs included Google Calendar (a scheduling program), Google Talk (an instant-messaging program), and Google Page Creator (a Web-page-creation program); in order to use these free programs, users had to tolerate advertisements and be reconciled to having their data stored on Google’s equipment. This type of deployment, in which both the data and the programs are located somewhere “out there” on the Internet, is often called cloud computing.
