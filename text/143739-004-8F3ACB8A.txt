Ophthalmoscope, instrument for inspecting the interior of the eye. The ophthalmoscope generally is considered to have been invented in 1851 by the German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz, though it is sometimes credited to English mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage, who in 1847 developed an instrument thought to resemble the ophthalmoscope. The ophthalmoscope became a model for later forms of endoscopy. The device consists of a strong light that can be directed into the eye by a small mirror or prism. The light reflects off the retina and back through a small hole in the ophthalmoscope, through which the examiner sees a nonstereoscopic magnified image of the structures at the back of the eye, including the optic disk, retina, retinal blood vessels, macula, and choroid. The ophthalmoscope is particularly useful as a screening tool for various ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy.
