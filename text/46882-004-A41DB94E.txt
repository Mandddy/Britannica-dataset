Ishikari River, Japanese Ishikari-gawa,  river in northern and western Hokkaido, northern Japan, the third longest in the country. It rises near the centre of the Kitami Mountains and flows for about 167 miles (268 km) southwest in a broad arc, draining the Kamikawa Basin, the Sorachi River lowland, and the Ishikari Plain. The river empties into Ishikari Bay of the Sea of Japan (East Sea) on the western side of Hokkaido.
The river’s name is derived from an Ainu term, ishikaribetsu, meaning “greatly meandering river,” which describes the flow of its lower course. Inundations usually occur twice a year, after the thaw of spring and the rains of summer. An extensive flood-control project, which provided a dependable water supply, allowed heavy industries to develop. Industrial growth, in turn, produced serious water pollution in the river valley, which was sacred to the Ainu.
