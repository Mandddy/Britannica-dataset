Sir William Edmond Logan,  (born April 20, 1798, Montreal, Que., Can.—died  June 22, 1875, Llechryd, Cardiganshire, Wales) one of the foremost Canadian geologists of the 19th century.
Logan was educated at the University of Edinburgh and began working for his uncle in London in 1818. From 1831 until 1838 he managed his uncle’s coal and copper-smelting interests in Swansea, Glamorganshire, and in this capacity he prepared geologic maps of the Welsh coalfields. Logan’s observations of the close association of underlying clay layers and fossil tree roots with local coal beds provided decisive evidence for the theory that coal beds are formed in place.
