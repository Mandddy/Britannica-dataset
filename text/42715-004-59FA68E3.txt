Sir George-Étienne Cartier, Baronet,  (born Sept. 6, 1814, St. Antoine, Lower Canada [now Quebec]—died  May 20, 1873, London, Eng.) statesman, Canadian prime minister jointly with John A. Macdonald (1857–58; 1858–62), and promoter of confederation and the improvement of Anglo-French relations in Canada.
Cartier practiced as a lawyer until 1837, when he took part in the rebellion that sent him into several months of exile in the United States. Elected as a Liberal reformer to the Canadian legislature in 1848, he was appointed provincial secretary for Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) in 1855 and two years later attorney general.
