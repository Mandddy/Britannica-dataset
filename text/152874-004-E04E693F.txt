The university was founded in 1892 by the residents of Mount Pleasant (as the Central Michigan Normal School and Business Institute) in order to provide the local schools with properly trained teachers. In 1895 the school came under the control of the state, and the name was changed to Central State Normal School. It became a four-year university in 1918, and more name changes followed before the school became Central Michigan University in 1959.
