Scarecrow,  device posted on cultivated ground to deter birds or other animals from eating or otherwise disturbing seeds, shoots, and fruit; its name derives from its use against the crow. The scarecrow of popular tradition is a mannequin stuffed with straw; free-hanging, often reflective parts movable by the wind are commonly attached to increase effectiveness. A scarecrow outfitted in clothes previously worn by a hunter who has fired on the flock is regarded by some as especially efficacious. A common variant is the effigy of a predator (e.g., an owl or a snake).
The function of the scarecrow is sometimes filled by various audio devices, including recordings of the calls or sounds of predators or noisome insects. Recorded sounds of deerflies in flight, for example, are used to deter deer from young tree plantations. Automatically fired carbide cannons and other simulated gunfire are used to keep migrating geese out of cornfields.
