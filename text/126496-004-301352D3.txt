Midi Canal, also called Languedoc Canal, French Canal du Midi or Canal du Languedoc,  historic canal in the Languedoc region of France, a major link in the inland waterway system from the Bay of Biscay of the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. It was built in the 17th century at a time when France was the centre of civil engineering excellence. The Midi Canal connects Toulouse, using water from an artificial reservoir built in the Montagne Noire (Black Mountain), with the Mediterranean at Sète via the Étang de Thau (Thau Lagoon). On its 240-km (149-mile) journey, the Midi Canal first rises 63 metres (206 feet), via 26 locks, on its 51.5-km (32-mile) stretch from Toulouse to its 5-km- (3-mile-) long summit, then descends 189 metres (620 feet) in 183.5 km (114 miles) by 74 locks to Étang de Thau. Following World War II, the canal became important for leisure boating, for which reason it is now the most heavily used canal in France. The Midi Canal was Europe’s first long-distance canal and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996.
After Leonardo da Vinci designed the first mitre gates in Milan (1497), he was brought to France in 1516 by Francis I, king of France and Milan. Leonardo looked at proposals for canals from the Garonne River to the Aude River and from the Loire River to the Saône River. The second was considered too difficult, but as the Hers and Fresquel, tributaries of the Garonne and Aude rivers, have sources just a few miles apart, a canal between them was considered possible, though the lack of a local water supply for the summit frustrated engineers for the next century and a half.
