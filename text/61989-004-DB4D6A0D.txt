Abigail Kelley Foster, née Abigail Kelley, byname Abby Foster  (born January 15, 1811, Pelham, Massachusetts, U.S.—died January 14, 1887, Worcester, Massachusetts) American feminist, abolitionist, and lecturer who is remembered as an impassioned speaker for radical reform.
Abby Kelley grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts. She was reared a Quaker, attended Quaker schools, and later taught in a Quaker school in Lynn, Massachusetts. She became a follower of William Lloyd Garrison and in 1835–37 was secretary of the Lynn Female Anti-Slavery Society. In 1838 she joined Garrison in founding the New England Non-Resistant Society. She took part in the first and second woman’s national antislavery conventions in New York City in 1837 and in Philadelphia in 1838, and at the latter she made her first address to a mixed audience (of men and women), a stirring speech that prompted abolitionist leaders to urge her to take to the platform regularly. She acceded to the idea, resigned her teaching job, and in May 1839 began a career as a reform lecturer. That career was a stormy one, bringing vituperation and sometimes even mob violence upon her as she was denounced regularly from the pulpit as immoral for daring to mount the public platform.
