Sir Joseph Whitworth, Baronet,  (born Dec. 21, 1803, Stockport, Cheshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 22, 1887, Monte-Carlo) English mechanical engineer who won international recognition as a machine toolmaker.
After working as a mechanic for various Manchester machine manufacturers, Whitworth went to London in 1825 and at Maudslay &amp; Company devised a scraping technique for making a true plane surface. Returning to Manchester in 1833, he opened his own toolmaking business. Between 1840 and 1850 he produced an original measuring machine and a system of accurate dimensional standards or master gauges to go with it. Even the common screw was not overlooked. In 1841 Whitworth’s standard screw threads were adopted by the Woolwich Arsenal.
