Nicodemus Tessin the Younger,  (born May 23, 1654, Nyköping, Sweden—died April 10, 1728, Stockholm) notable Swedish Baroque architect.
The son of the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder, he took over his father’s position as Stockholm’s city architect after studying in Paris and Rome during the 1670s. He completed his father’s Drottningholm palace and then futilely tried to interest the French king Louis XIV in his proposals for building the New Louvre and a temple of Apollo at Versailles. His main achievement was the Royal Palace at Stockholm, built to replace an older brick structure that was destroyed by fire in 1697. The rebuilt palace is a huge blocklike structure with a severe Classical facade but having richly Baroque interior decorations and furniture. Nicodemus the Younger’s son, the noted Swedish statesman Carl Gustaf Tessin, enlarged his father’s large collection of architectural drawings, which are now in the National Museum in Stockholm.
