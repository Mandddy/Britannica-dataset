Calaverite,  a gold telluride mineral (AuTe2) that is a member of the krennerite group of sulfides and perhaps a structurally altered form (paramorph) of krennerite; it generally contains some silver replacing gold. Calaverite is most commonly found in veins that have formed at low temperatures, as in sites at Kalgoorlie, Australia; Cripple Creek, Colo.; and Calaveras county, Calif., for which it is named. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system. For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
