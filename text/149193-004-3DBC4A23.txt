Whoopi Goldberg, original name Caryn Elaine Johnson  (born November 13, 1955, New York, New York, U.S.) American comedian, actress, and producer known for her work in theatre, film, television, and recordings. An accomplished performer with a wide repertoire, her work ranged from dramatic leading roles to controversial comedic performances.
Goldberg spent her early years in a Manhattan housing project. She began performing at age eight with a children’s theatre group and later, as a young adult, went on to perform in the choruses of Broadway shows. She moved to California in 1974 and soon became active in the theatre community there, as well as establishing a presence as a stand-up comedian. Eventually she developed The Spook Show, a one-woman stage show noted for its humour, satire, and drama, which she performed throughout the United States and Europe. That performance became the basis for the critically acclaimed Broadway show Whoopi Goldberg, which debuted in 1984, and in 1985 Goldberg won a Grammy Award for the show’s recording. Soon afterward she made her Hollywood debut in The Color Purple (1985), for which she garnered an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe Award.
