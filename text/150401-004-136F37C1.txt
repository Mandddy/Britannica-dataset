Aquarius/SAC-D, also called SAC-D/Aquarius,  joint U.S.-Argentine space mission to map the salinity of Earth’s oceans. Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas-D (SAC-D) was launched by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on June 10, 2011.
Salinity, or salt content, plays a major role in the movement of ocean currents and traces the amount of evaporation from and precipitation onto the ocean that occurs in the water cycle. Aquarius is a U.S.-built instrument consisting of a radiometer and a scatterometer designed to measure salinity. The radiometer measures changes in the ocean’s brightness in three beams in radio waves. These changes in brightness are associated with changes in the ocean’s salt content. The scatterometer measures the ocean surface’s roughness, which introduces uncertainty into the salinity measurement. Salinity is usually between 32 and 37 practical salinity units (psu); Aquarius is designed to measure salinity to an accuracy of 0.2 psu. Salinity measurements have previously been made by using ships, buoys, and aircraft and thus have been sporadic and uneven. Aquarius maps all of Earth’s oceans every week with a resolution of 150 km (90 miles) and within its first two months of operation collected more salinity measurements than had been made in the previous 125 years.
