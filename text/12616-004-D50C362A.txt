Crake, any of numerous marsh birds of the family Rallidae (order Gruiformes), generally any small rail in which the bill is short and conical. The name is chiefly European but can be extended to New World rails of this type. The most widespread genus is Porzana (13 species), typified by the spotted crake (P. porzana) found in Europe and eastward to Mongolia; in winter it reaches southern Asia and northern Africa. It is a brown bird 25 cm (10 inches) long with a light-spotted breast and buffy undertail. Its New World counterpart is the sora, or Carolina rail (P. carolina). The sora is about 23 cm (9 inches) long and grayish brown with black on the face and throat, with a short yellow bill. Other Porzana species are Baillon’s crake (P. pusilla), occurring in parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand; the spotless crake (P. tabuensis), ranging from Australia to the Philippines; and the little crake (P. parva), a relatively common Eurasian form.
The corncrake, or land rail (Crex crex), of Europe and Asia, migrating south to Africa, is a slightly larger brown bird with a rather stout bill and wings showing reddish in flight. Africa’s black crake (Limnocorax flavirostra) is a 20-centimetre- (8-inch-) long form, black with a green bill and pink legs. It is less secretive than most. Pygmy crakes (Sarothrura species), about 14 cm (6 inches) long, are very secretive, inhabiting swampy African forests. Other New World crakes are the several species of Laterallus (including the black rail, L. jamaicensis) and several related genera.
