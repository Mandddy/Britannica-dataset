Marc Newson,  (born 1963, Sydney, Australia) Australian designer known most notably for creating unique household goods, furniture, and interior spaces from unusual materials.
Newson attended the Sydney College of the Arts and graduated in 1984 with a degree in jewelry and sculpture. The following year he won a grant from the Crafts Board of the Australia Council, which enabled him to create his breakthrough piece, the aluminum and fibreglass Lockheed Lounge (1986). This was the first of several limited-edition chairs. Like many of his later furniture pieces, it is made of atypical materials. It has a seamless exterior and a Modernist yet somewhat retro form variously described as biomorphic or zoomorphic. In 1987 Newson moved to Japan, where he worked mostly with the design company Id√©e, creating among other objects the Charlotte chair (1987), the Super Guppy lamp (1987), the Embryo chair (1988), the three-legged carbon-fibre Black Hole table (1988), the Orgone lounge (1989), the Felt chair (1989), and the Wicker chair (1990).
