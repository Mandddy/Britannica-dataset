Lauryn Hill,  (born May 26, 1975, South Orange, New Jersey, U.S.) American singer whose soulful voice propelled her to the top of the hip-hop and rhythm-and-blues charts.
Hill and high school classmate Prakazrel (“Pras”) Michel performed together under the name Tranzlator Crew and were joined shortly thereafter by Wyclef Jean. As a teenager, Hill also acted on the television soap opera As the World Turns and alongside Whoopi Goldberg in the film Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. With the money she earned from her acting jobs, she helped finance her group, renamed the Fugees in 1993. It was eventually signed to a division of Columbia Records, but its debut album, Blunted on Reality (1994), attracted less-than-spectacular reviews. Critics commented that Hill overshadowed her partners and that she should strike out on her own. The group’s second album, The Score (1996), which featured an impressive remake of Roberta Flack’s 1973 hit “Killing Me Softly with His Song,” was much better received, selling more than 18 million copies and earning two Grammy Awards. Hill, who had been pursuing a degree in history at Columbia University, abandoned her studies, and the group’s members decided to pursue their individual interests.
