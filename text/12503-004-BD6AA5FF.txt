John Curwen,  (born Nov. 14, 1816, Heckmondwike, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  May 26, 1880, Manchester) British music educator and founder of the tonic sol-fa system of musical notation, which concentrates the student’s attention on the relating of sounds to notation in a systematic way.
The son of a Congregational minister, he was himself a minister from 1838 until 1864, when he began to devote himself to propagating his new method of musical nomenclature. Curwen adapted his system from that of Sarah Ann Glover (1786–1867), whose Manual of the Norwich Sol-fa System (1845) used the syllables of the system of notation of Guido of Arezzo, and he also adapted from the system of Aimé Paris (1798–1866) terms for the notation of rhythm. Curwen’s method of teaching was founded on the attraction of notes to the tonic and, in modulation, to the principle of a shifting tonic (“the movable do”). In 1853 he founded the Tonic Sol-fa Association (later the English Schools Music Association), and from then on his method was widely adopted in schools and choral societies. In 1863 he established a publishing house for music (Curwen &amp; Sons, Ltd.) and three years later became lecturer at Anderson’s College, Glasgow. In 1879 the Tonic Sol-fa College (later the Curwen Memorial College) was opened. His son, John Spencer Curwen (1847–1916), succeeded him as director of the publishing firm and founded in England the competition festival movement for amateur musicians. His system, or variants of it, has remained continuously in use in music schools of Europe and the United States.
