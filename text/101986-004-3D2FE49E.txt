Lucien Bonaparte,  original Italian Luciano Buonaparte   (born May 21, 1775, Ajaccio, Corsica—died  June 29, 1840, Viterbo, Italy) Napoleon I’s second surviving brother who, as president of the Council of Five Hundred at Saint-Cloud, was responsible for Napoleon’s election as consul on 19 Brumaire (Nov. 10, 1799).
Educated in France, Lucien returned to Corsica in 1789 and became an outspoken speaker in the Jacobin Club at Ajaccio. He urged his brothers to break with the Corsican patriot Pasquale Paoli, and he headed a Corsican deputation that went to France to denounce Paoli and to solicit aid against him. In the south of France he worked hard for the Jacobin cause. The coup d’etat of Thermidor (July 1794) compelled him to accept a small post at St.-Chamans. There he was arrested and imprisoned until Napoleon procured his release and found him a post as commissioner in the French army in Germany. Lucien disliked the army and was sent to Corsica. In 1798 he entered the Council of Five Hundred as deputy for Corsica. He was president of that body on 18–19 Brumaire (Nov. 9–10, 1799), when Napoleon overthrew the national councils at the palace of Saint-Cloud. By refusing to put the vote of outlawry, for which the majority of the council clamoured, by his opportune closing of the sitting, and by appealing to the soldiers outside to disperse “the representatives of the dagger,” Lucien turned the scale in favour of his brother.
