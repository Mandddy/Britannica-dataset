Heidi Klum,  (born June 1, 1973, Bergisch Gladbach, North Rhine–Westphalia, West Germany) German American supermodel and businesswoman who hosted Germany’s Next Topmodel and Project Runway.
In 1992, while living near Cologne with her father, a cosmetics company executive, and mother, a hairdresser, 18-year-old Klum entered the “Model 92” German beauty contest. Out of 25,000 contestants, Klum won the top prize—a $300,000 contract with New York City’s Metropolitan Models. After a brief sojourn in South Beach, Florida, Klum moved to New York City, where she launched her modeling career in 1993. Her breakthrough came when in 1994 she appeared on the cover of Mirabella magazine. In the mid-1990s Klum achieved increased visibility as a cover model for Vogue, ELLE, and Marie Claire magazines, but her most important appearance was on the February 20, 1998, swimsuit cover of the widely read Sports Illustrated. In 1999 she achieved global recognition as one of the original “Angels,” a troupe of Victoria’s Secret lingerie models who appeared in annual televised runway shows and at other promotional events. Klum continued to model for Victoria’s Secret and also designed an eponymous lingerie and cosmetics collection for the retailer.
