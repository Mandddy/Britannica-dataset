Hans Aeschbacher,  (born January 18, 1906, Zürich, Switzerland—died January 27, 1980, Zürich) Swiss sculptor of severe and massive abstract forms.
Trained as a printer, Aeschbacher taught himself to draw and paint and began sculpting about age 30. His earliest pieces were figurative and were composed mainly from terra-cotta and plaster. By 1945 he was working essentially with stone, and his sculptures became increasingly abstract, geometrical, and austere. With Abstract Faces (1945), Aeschbacher eliminated representational detail from his unified architectonic stone volumes. His predominant use of porous lava rock in the mid-1950s relieved some of the rigidity of his forms. Though his sculptures of the late ’50s were less austere, Aeschbacher soon returned to the massive scale (some pieces 15 feet [4.5 metres] high) and stern geometry of his previous work. Explorer I, placed at the Zürich-Kloten Airport, is exemplary.
