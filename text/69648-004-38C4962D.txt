Oncogene, genetic material that carries the ability to induce cancer. An oncogene is a sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that has been altered or mutated from its original form, the proto-oncogene. Operating as a positive growth regulator, the proto-oncogene is involved in promoting the differentiation and proliferation of normal cells. A variety of proto-oncogenes are involved in different crucial steps of cell growth, and a change in the proto-oncogeneâ€™s sequence or in the amount of protein it produces can interfere with its normal role in cellular regulation. Uncontrolled cell growth, or neoplastic transformation, can ensue, ultimately resulting in the formation of a cancerous tumour.
Oncogenes first were discovered in certain retroviruses (viruses composed of RNA instead of DNA and that contain reverse transcriptase) and were identified as cancer-causing agents in many animals. In the mid-1970s, the American microbiologists John Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus tested the theory that healthy body cells contain dormant viral oncogenes that, when triggered, cause cancer. They showed that oncogenes are actually derived from normal genes (proto-oncogenes) present in the body cells of their host.
