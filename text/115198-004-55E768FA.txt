Battle of Eylau, (Feb. 7–8, 1807), one of the engagements in the Napoleonic War of the Third Coalition. The first major deadlock suffered by Napoleon, the battle was fought around the East Prussian town of Eylau (modern Bagrationovsk, Russia), 23 miles (37 km) south of Königsberg (Kaliningrad). The 76,000 Russians and Prussians under Leonty Leontyevich Bennigsen confronted 74,000 men under Napoleon shortly after the Russians launched an unexpected winter offensive. An initial unplanned battle on February 7 cost each side about 4,000 casualties without accomplishing anything. On the morning of the 8th, Napoleon had only 41,000 men to the Russians’ 63,000, and he fought a delaying action until his reinforcements arrived. Napoleon tried to stem the Russian advances by cavalry attacks. The first of these was beaten back in a blinding snowstorm, with heavy losses. Meanwhile, three Russian columns headed for the weak French lines, threatening to overwhelm them.
Napoleon ordered a 10,700-man cavalry reserve under Joachim Murat to charge the advancing columns and the Russian centre. In one of the greatest cavalry charges in history, they halted the Russian attack, slashed through the Russian centre in two columns, re-formed in a single column in the Russian rear, and plunged through the re-forming lines again. This attack enabled Napoleon to hold his centre and overcome the crisis. During the next six hours both sides received reinforcements. The stalemate continued until exhaustion ended the fighting at 10 pm. Each army had lost between 18,000 and 25,000 men. Bennigsen retired during the night.
