Cornelia Otis Skinner,  (born May 30, 1901, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died July 9, 1979, New York, New York) American actress and author who, with satirical wit, wrote light verse, monologues, anecdotes, sketches, and monodramas in which she displayed her versatile and distinctive acting skills.
Skinner made her first professional stage appearance with her father, the tragedian Otis Skinner, in Blood and Sand (1921) and collaborated with him in writing her first play, Captain Fury (1925). During the 1930s she wrote and staged her own monodramas, including The Loves of Charles II, The Empress Eugénie, The Mansions on the Hudson, and The Wives of Henry VIII. In each of these shows she played several different characters, adeptly transforming herself from one role to another. It was not until 1939 in Candida that Skinner established a reputation as a fine actress, and she confirmed her excellence as a dramatic actress in Theatre (1941). Other performances that won critical acclaim included her roles in Lady Windermere’s Fan (1946), Paris ’90 (1952), and The Pleasure of His Company (1958), which she wrote with Samuel Taylor.
