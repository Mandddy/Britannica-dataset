Nógrád, megye (county), northern Hungary. It is bounded by Slovakia to the north and by the counties of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén to the northeast, Heves to the east and southeast, and Pest to the southwest and west. Salgótarján is the county seat.
The Hungarian population of Nógrád is descended from the Palóc, a group of people from northeastern Hungary. Some towns (including Nógrád, Bánk, Felsopetény, and Alsópetény, among others) are inhabited by notable ethnic Slovak populations, while others (principally Szendehely and Berkenye) are home to significant ethnic German populations.
