Edaphosaurus (genus Edaphosaurus), primitive herbivorous relative of mammals that is found in fossil deposits dating from Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian periods (318 million to 271 million years ago).
Edaphosaurus was more than 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) long, with a short, low skull and blunt conical teeth. The head was very small in comparison with the massive barrel-like body. More distinctive, however, was the large “sail” on its back formed by elongated vertebral arches; the arches were probably connected by a membrane that had bony knobs or crossbars along its length. The sail may have functioned in thermoregulation and also may have served as a storehouse for phosphates, which could be easily mobilized from the bony projections supporting the sail. The sail also may have had a defensive function, giving the animal a larger and more imposing appearance to predators.
