Fulmar,  any of several species of gull-like oceanic birds of the family Procellariidae (order Procellariiformes), which also includes the petrels and the shearwaters. The name fulmar refers especially to the two species of the genus Fulmarus. Fulmars fly low over the waves of the open ocean, thus resembling their narrower-winged relatives, the shearwaters. Fulmars will eat almost anything; their natural foods are small fish, squid, and crustaceans; but they often take shipsâ€™ garbage and will come ashore for carrion.
The northern fulmar, or fulmar petrel (F. glacialis), nests in colonies on oceanic cliffs of the Arctic islands, the British Isles, and the coast of western Europe; in winter it is abundant in offshore waters in the sub-Arctic and temperate zones. The southern fulmar (F. glacialoides) has a comparable distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Both fulmars are typically predominately white with a pearly gray mantle, but darker colour phases occur in some populations.
