Waterskiing, planing over the surface of the water on broad skilike runners while being towed by a motorboat moving at least 24 km/hr (15 mph). The skier holds onto a handle on a rope attached to the rear of the boat and leans slightly backward.
Water skis are made of wood, aluminum, fibreglass, or other materials. General-purpose skis are usually about 1.7 m (5.5 ft) long and about 15 cm (6 in) wide. Ski sizes increase for heavier skiers. Each ski has a stabilizing fin on the bottom near the heel. Tight-fitting rubber foot bindings stretch in case of a fall, releasing the skierâ€™s feet without injury.
