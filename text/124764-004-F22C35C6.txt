Gohei,  in the Shint≈ç religion of Japan, a kind of paper or cloth offering made to a god. The gohei consists of an upright stick to which is attached a strip of paper or cloth folded in such a way that zigzag folds fall on either side. The many styles of gohei are differentiated from one another by the number of folds, manner of folding, colour, and material of the strips. According to one point of view, the gohei also operates as a symbol of the kami (god, or sacred power) and indicates that the deity is present in the shrine.
