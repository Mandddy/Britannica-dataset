Bath,  process of soaking the body in water or some other aqueous matter such as mud, steam, or milk. The bath may have cleanliness or curative purposes, and it can have religious, mystical, or some other meaning (see ritual bath).
The bath as an institution has a long history. Writings from ancient biblical and other sources mention baths. Architectural remains from ancient Egypt indicate the existence of special bathrooms, and both vase paintings and restored ruins show that the Greeks of classical antiquity thought the bath important. Roman baths featuring a combination of steaming, cleaning, and massage appeared wherever the Romans made conquests. In Rome itself the aqueducts fed sumptuous baths such as those of Caracalla, which covered 28 acres (11 hectares).
