Europasaurus, genus representing one of the smallest known sauropod dinosaurs, characterized by a distinctive arched head, proportionally long neck, and elevated shoulders. Europasaurus is known from a single quarry in northern Germany, in deposits dated to the Late Jurassic (some 150 million years ago). The quarry contained elements of more than 10 individuals. Although to date no complete skeleton has been found, most body parts are represented by the available bones, and thus the skeletal anatomy of Europasaurus can be reasonably discerned. Except for its size, this dinosaur resembles Brachiosaurus.
Studies of the microscopic structure of bones from several specimens show that different ages are represented and that the largest specimen was fully adult. Known specimens vary in total length from 1.7 metres (6 feet) in juveniles to 6.2 metres (20 feet) in the largest adult. When alive, the largest specimen probably weighed about 500 kg (about 1,100 pounds), roughly the same weight as a present-day cow.
