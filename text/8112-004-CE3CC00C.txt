Vizsla, breed of sporting dog whose ancestors were probably brought to Hungary by the Magyars more than 1,000 years ago. The vizsla can generally work both as a pointer and as a retriever. Developed on the open plains of Hungary, it was bred to be a swift and cautious hunter, wary of alerting its quarry. It is a graceful, pointerlike dog and has a short, smooth, reddish gold or sandy-yellow coat. It stands 21 to 24 inches (53 to 61 cm) and weighs 40 to 60 pounds (18 to 27 kg).
