The University of Miami was chartered in 1925 and opened the following year. In its first 15 years of existence, the university floundered financially, undergoing bankruptcy and reorganization when the local real-estate market collapsed, the area was devastated by a major hurricane, and the Great Depression hit. Its rescue was aided by the origination, in 1933, of what became known as the Orange Bowl, a collegiate American football game played annually on or just after New Yearâ€™s Day (January 1); the university itself is renowned for its often superb football teams.
