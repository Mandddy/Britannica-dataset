Ted Williams, in full Theodore Samuel Williams, bynames the Splendid Splinter and Teddy Ballgame  (born Aug. 30, 1918, San Diego, Calif., U.S.—died July 5, 2002, Inverness, Fla.)  professional baseball player who compiled a lifetime batting average of .344 as an outfielder with the American League Boston Red Sox from 1939 to 1960. He was the last player to hit .400 in Major League Baseball (.406 in 1941).
Williams was an excellent ballplayer as a child and later led his high school team to the state championships. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed, baseball’s most desirable combination. Williams was signed by a minor league team in the Pacific Coast League, and after several seasons in San Diego and Minneapolis he was brought up to the Red Sox major league team in 1939. He had a fine rookie season with a batting average of .327.
