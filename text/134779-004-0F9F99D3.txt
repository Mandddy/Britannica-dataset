Karl Alfred, knight von Zittel,  (born Sept. 25, 1839, Bahlingen, Baden [Germany]—died Jan. 5, 1904, Munich, Ger.) paleontologist who proved that the Sahara had not been under water during the Pleistocene Ice Age.
In 1863 Zittel became an assistant to the royal mineral cabinet of Vienna and professor of mineralogy, geognosy, and paleontology at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic. In 1866 he became professor of geology and paleontology at the University of Munich. His early research was in minerals and petrography. As the geologist of an expedition to Libya in 1873–74, Zittel collected the evidence leading to his conclusion about the Sahara. He later accepted evolution and led in applying the theory to paleontology, especially in his studies of ammonites. In 1876 he began his work on fossil sponges, which established their classification and laid a basis for the classification of modern forms. His principal contributions to vertebrate paleontology dealt with turtle and pterodactyl fossils found in the Bavarian limestones.
