Detlev, baron von Liliencron, in full Friedrich Adolf Axel Detlev Liliencron   (born June 3, 1844, Kiel, Holstein [Germany]—died  July 22, 1909, Alt-Rahlstedt, near Hamburg) German writer, noted for his fresh and unconventional verse.
The son of an impoverished family of baronial descent, Liliencron entered the Prussian army in 1863. He served as a regular officer during the Seven Weeks’ War (1866) and the Franco-German War (1870–71). He later used experiences from these campaigns in his poems and stories. In 1875 Liliencron left the army because of debts; after spending some time in America, he entered the civil service in 1878. From 1887 he struggled to make a living as a full-time writer.
