Cladoselache, genus of extinct sharks, known from fossilized remains in Upper Devonian rocks (formed 385â€“359 million years ago) in North America and Europe.
Cladoselache is a good representative of early sharks. Unlike larger forms, its mouth opened at the front of the skull, rather than beneath it, and both its pectoral and pelvic fins were broadly attached to its body. These features suggest that this shark, while less maneuverable than larger sharks, was a high-speed predator. Two dorsal fins were present along the midline, and strong spines were developed behind the head and at the base of the pectoral fins.
