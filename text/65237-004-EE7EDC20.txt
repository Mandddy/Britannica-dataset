Ethan Allen,  (born January 21, 1738, Litchfield, Connecticut [U.S.]—died  February 12, 1789, Burlington, Vermont, U.S.) soldier and frontiersman, leader of the Green Mountain Boys during the American Revolution.
After fighting in the French and Indian War (1754–63), Allen settled in what is now Vermont. At the outbreak of the American Revolution, he raised his force of Green Mountain Boys (organized in 1770) and Connecticut troops and helped capture the British fort at Ticonderoga, New York (May 10, 1775). Later, as a volunteer in General Philip Schuyler’s forces, he conducted a foolhardy attempt to take Montreal (September 1775), in the course of which he was captured by the British and held prisoner until May 6, 1778. Congress gave Allen the brevet rank of colonel with back pay, but he did not serve in the war after his release. Instead, he devoted his time to local affairs in Vermont, especially working for separate statehood from New York. Failing to achieve this, he attempted to negotiate the annexation of Vermont to Canada.
