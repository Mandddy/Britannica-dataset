Turaco (order Musophagiformes), also spelled touraco, also called lourie or plantain-eater,  any of about 18 species in six genera of colourful, fruit-eating African birds. The green and iridescent turacos (Tauraco, Musophaga, and Corythaeola) are primarily residents of dense broad-leaved evergreen forest; the grayer forms (Crinifer), most of which are called go-away birds (because the calls of some are “g’way, g’way”), are found in more open woodland, including savanna.
Turacos are remarkable for their coloration. Some are predominantly gray, brown, and white, but the 10 species of the genus Tauraco and the 2 species of Musophaga possess a unique and beautiful red pigment, turacin, and a green pigment, turacoverdin. The former occurs in the wing feathers of all 12 species and in the crests of a few; turacoverdin is found in the body plumage of these species and some of Corythaixoides. Most turacos also have prominent head crests.
