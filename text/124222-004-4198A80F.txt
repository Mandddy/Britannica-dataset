Spiny-tailed lizard, also called mastigure,  (Uromastyx), any of more than a dozen species belonging to the lizard family Agamidae. Spiny-tailed lizards live in arid and semiarid habitats from northern Africa to India. They are limbed lizards with broad heads and stout bodies, and most adults grow up to about 25 to 30 cm (10 to 12 inches) in length.
Their stout tail is armed with numerous protective spines that discourage most predators. Some spiny-tailed lizards defend themselves by partly entering their burrows and then violently lashing their exposed tails from side to side at their enemies. All species lay eggs and are predominately herbivorous as adults.
