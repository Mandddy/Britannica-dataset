Lyman Beecher,  (born Oct. 12, 1775, New Haven, Conn.—died  Jan. 10, 1863, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.) U.S. Presbyterian clergyman in the revivalist tradition.
A graduate of Yale in 1797, he held pastorates at Litchfield, Conn., and at Boston, during which he opposed rationalism, Catholicism, and the liquor traffic. Turning his attention to evangelizing the West, he became president of the newly founded Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio (1832–50), and also assumed a new pastorate there (1832–42). His Calvinism, considered strict by Bostonians, proved so mild for western Presbyterians that he was tried for heresy, but his synod acquitted him.
