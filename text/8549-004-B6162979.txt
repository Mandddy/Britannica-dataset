History of medicine, the development of the prevention and treatment of disease from prehistoric and ancient times to the 20th century.
Unwritten history is not easy to interpret, and, although much may be learned from a study of the drawings, bony remains, and surgical tools of early human beings, it is difficult to reconstruct their mental attitude toward the problems of disease and death. It seems probable that humans, as soon as they reached the stage of reasoning, discovered by the process of trial and error which plants might be used as foods, which of them were poisonous, and which of them had some medicinal value. Folk medicine or domestic medicine, consisting largely in the use of vegetable products, or herbs, originated in this fashion and still persists.
