Petrus Borel, original name Joseph-Pierre Borel, also called Borel d’Hauterive  (born June 29, 1809, Lyon, Fr.—died  July 1859, Mostaganem, Alg.) French poet, novelist, and critic active in the Romantic movement.
The 12th of an ironmonger’s 14 children, Borel was trained as an architect but turned to literature and became one of the most eccentric young writers of the 1830s, assuming the name of “Lycanthrope” (“Wolf-Man”). He became a leader of the group of daring writers known as Les Bousingos, among whom were Gérard de Nerval and Théophile Gautier. With the revival of interest in classical style, he fell into poverty. However, he was able to obtain a post in the colonization of Algeria. Because of his proud and touchy nature, he was dismissed in 1855 and spent the rest of his life, ragged and unkempt, in a Gothic mansion in Mostaganem. His works, redolent of horror and melodrama, include Rhapsodies (1832), the short stories in Champavert, contes immoraux (1833; “Champavert, Immoral Stories”), and Madame Putiphar (1839), with a verse prologue that foreshadows the poet Charles Baudelaire’s spiritual style. Borel’s intensity, as an individual and a writer, would later inspire the Surrealists.
