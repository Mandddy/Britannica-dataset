George Sutherland, original name Alexander George Sutherland   (born March 25, 1862, Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, Eng.—died  July 18, 1942, Stockbridge, Mass., U.S.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1922–38).
Sutherland’s family immigrated to the United States—to Utah—when he was an infant. He was later educated at Brigham Young Academy and the University of Michigan. Sutherland was admitted to the bar in 1883 and opened a practice in Provo, Utah, where he quickly became involved in politics and ran unsuccessfully for mayor and for territorial delegate to Congress. By this time he had become a Republican, and after Utah’s admission as a state he served in the state Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives (1901–03), and the U.S. Senate (1905–17). Although a conservative, he supported many of Pres. Theodore Roosevelt’s reform programs.
