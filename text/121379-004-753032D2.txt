San Miniato al Monte, also called San Miniato,  three-aisled basilican church in Florence completed in 1062. It is considered one of the finest examples of the Tuscan Romanesque style of architecture. The black and white marble panels used to ornament both the interior and the exterior, as well as the painted timber truss roof, are notable decorative features. The church was begun after 1018 by Bishop Hildebrand, and the facade was finished in the 12th century.
