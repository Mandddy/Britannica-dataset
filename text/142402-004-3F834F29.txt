Árgos, city in the nomós (department) of Argolís, northeastern Peloponnese (Modern Greek: Pelopónnisos), Greece. It lies just north of the head of the Gulf of Argolís (Argolikós Kólpos).
The name Árgos apparently signified an agricultural plain and was applied to several districts in ancient Greece. Historically, the Argolís was the easternmost portion of the Peloponnesian peninsula, and the city of Árgos was its capital. Agamemnon, Diomedes, and other heroes from Argolís’s fertile plain figure prominently in the Iliad of Homer. The present city of Árgos lies about 4 miles (6.5 km) from the gulf below Kástro hill (ancient Lárissa), a site probably occupied since the Early Bronze Age and very prominent in Mycenaean times (c. 1300–1200 bce). A small market town on the Corinth-Návplion rail line, it is built over much of the site of the Classical city.
