Robert Edwin Peary,  (born May 6, 1856, Cresson, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died February 20, 1920, Washington, D.C.) U.S. Arctic explorer usually credited with leading the first expedition to reach the North Pole (1909).
Peary entered the U.S. Navy in 1881 and pursued a naval career until his retirement, with leaves of absence granted for Arctic exploration. In 1886—with Christian Maigaard, who was the Danish assistant governor of Ritenbenk, Greenland, and two native Greenlanders—he traveled inland from Disko Bay over the Greenland ice sheet for 161 km (100 miles), reaching a point 2,288 metres (7,500 feet) above sea level. Peary hired African American explorer Matthew Henson, who would accompany him on several expeditions, as his assistant in 1887. In 1891 Peary ventured again to Greenland with seven companions—a party that included his wife, Josephine, in addition to Henson and American physician and explorer Frederick A. Cook, who in 1909 would claim to have reached the North Pole before Peary. On this expedition Peary sledged 2,100 km (1,300 miles) to northeastern Greenland, discovered Independence Fjord, and found evidence of Greenland’s being an island. He also studied the “Arctic Highlanders,” an isolated Eskimo tribe who helped him greatly on later expeditions.
