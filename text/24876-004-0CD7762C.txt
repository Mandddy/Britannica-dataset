Count Hayashi Tadasu,  (born Feb. 22, 1850, Chiba prefecture, Japan—died  July 10, 1913, Tokyo) Japanese diplomat who negotiated the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902.
Hayashi studied in England, but upon his return home in 1868, at the time of the Meiji Restoration, he joined a short-lived rebellion of diehard Tokugawa loyalists against the new imperial government. He was imprisoned until 1871 and was then assigned as interpreter to Iwakura Tomomi’s diplomatic mission to the Western powers. Thereafter he joined the diplomatic service, becoming vice-minister for foreign affairs in 1891.
