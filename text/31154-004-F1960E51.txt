Charles Burney,  (born April 7, 1726, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Eng.—died April 12, 1814, Chelsea, Middlesex) organist, composer, and the foremost music historian of his time in England.
After attending Chester Free School (1739–42), Burney returned to Shrewsbury, assisted his half-brother, a church organist, and learned violin and French. In 1744 he began a musical apprenticeship with Thomas Arne at Drury Lane, in London, where he later collaborated with David Garrick. He married Esther Sleepe in June 1749 (one of their daughters was the English novelist Fanny Burney), became organist at St. Dionis’ Backchurch in October, and that winter succeeded John Stanley as organist and harpsichordist of the concerts at the King’s Arms, Cornhill.
