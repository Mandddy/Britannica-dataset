Hammer throw, sport in athletics (track and field) in which a hammer is hurled for distance, using two hands within a throwing circle.
The sport developed centuries ago in the British Isles. Legends trace it to the Tailteann Games held in Ireland about 2000 bce, when the Celtic hero CÃº Chulainn gripped a chariot wheel by its axle, whirled it around his head, and threw it farther than did any other individual. Wheel hurling was later replaced by throwing a boulder attached to the end of a wooden handle. Forms of hammer throwing were practiced among the ancient Teutonic tribes at religious festivals honouring the god Thor, and sledgehammer throwing was practiced in 15th- and 16th-century Scotland and England.
