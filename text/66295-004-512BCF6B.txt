Nelson Algren, original name Nelson Ahlgren Abraham   (born March 28, 1909, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—died May 9, 1981, Sag Harbor, New York) writer whose novels of the poor are lifted from routine naturalism by his vision of their pride, humour, and unquenchable yearnings. He also catches with poetic skill the mood of the city’s underside: its jukebox pounding, stench, and neon glare.
The son of a machinist, Algren grew up in Chicago, where his parents moved when he was three years old. He worked his way through the University of Illinois, graduating in journalism in the depth of the Great Depression. Sometime after graduating, he adopted a simplified spelling of the original name, Ahlgren, of his Swedish grandfather, who had converted to Judaism and taken the name Abraham. He went on the road as a door-to-door salesman and migratory worker in the South and Southwest, then returned to Chicago, where he was employed briefly by a WPA (Works Progress Administration) writers’ project and a venereal-disease control unit of the Board of Health. In this period, too, he edited with the proletarian novelist Jack Conroy the New Anvil, a magazine dedicated to the publication of experimental and leftist writing.
