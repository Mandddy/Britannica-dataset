Sarsaparilla,  aromatic flavouring agent made from the roots of several tropical vines belonging to the Smilax genus of the lily family (Liliaceae). Once a popular tonic, sarsaparilla is now used to flavour and mask the taste of medicines. In combination with wintergreen and other flavours it is used in root beer and other carbonated beverages.
The sarsaparilla plants (Spanish zarza, “bramble,” and parrilla, “little vine”) are native to the southern and western coasts of Mexico to Peru. They are large, perennial, climbing or trailing vines with short, thick, underground stems producing many prickly, angular, aboveground stems. These are supported by tendrils springing from the bases of large, alternate, stalked leaves.
