Chen Kaige,  (born August 12, 1952, Beijing, China) Chinese film director noted for his realistic, sensitive, compassionate, and unflinching view of the lives and hopes of the Chinese people. He was best known for the award-winning film Bawang bieji (1993; Farewell My Concubine).
Chen was the son of teacher and filmmaker Chen Huai’ai. In 1967 he was sent to rural Yunnan province to work on a rubber plantation. During his time among the impoverished workers there, Chen was indelibly impressed by the vast differences between the aspirations of the peasants and the harsh reality of their lives. After leaving Yunnan, Chen began a five-year stint in the army, which included a brief tour in Laos. When he returned to Beijing in 1975, he elected to pursue a career in film rather than a university degree with a major in poetry. In 1978 he entered the Beijing Film Academy, which had just reopened after the Cultural Revolution (1966–76). Not long after his graduation, Chen became a leading member of what became known as the “fifth generation” of Chinese filmmakers.
