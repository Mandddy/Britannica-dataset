Sculpin, also called bullhead or sea scorpion,  any of the numerous, usually small fish of the family Cottidae (order Scorpaeniformes), found in both salt water and fresh water, principally in northern regions of the world. Sculpins are elongated, tapered fish, usually with wide, heavy heads. The gill covers have one or more spines, the pectoral fins are large and fanlike, and the skin is either naked or provided with small spines.
Sculpins are bottom-dwelling, inactive fish. Most are found in shallow sea waters, though some live in deeper waters, and others, such as the millerâ€™s-thumb (Cottus gobio), inhabit freshwater. The sculpins are of little value to humans, as they are not generally considered tasty. Some, such as the sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus), are of use as bait for lobster pots, and some are of negative importance as consumers of valuable shrimp and young salmon and trout.
