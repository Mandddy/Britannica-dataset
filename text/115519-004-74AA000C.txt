São Paulo, estado (state) of southeastern Brazil, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast and bounded by the states of Minas Gerais (northeast), Rio de Janeiro (east), Paraná (southwest), and Mato Grosso do Sul (west). São Paulo constitutes the heart of the Southeast, Brazil’s most developed and populous region. The state itself is the most economically productive and populous in the country, accounting for more than one-fifth of the national population. It produces more than half of the country’s manufactures and much of its leading crop—coffee. The overwhelming majority of its population is urban and suburban. The state capital, São Paulo, is the largest city in Brazil (having overtaken Rio de Janeiro in the 1950s) and one of the largest urban centres in the world. Area 95,834 square miles (248,209 square km). Pop. (2010) 41,262,199.
São Paulo has a coastline 370 miles (600 km) long. The narrow coastal zone is broken by lagoons, tidal channels, and mountain spurs. It is bordered by the slopes of the Serra do Mar, on the edge of an extensive plateau with wide, grassy plains, about 1,500 to 3,000 feet (460 to 920 metres) above sea level. Isolated ranges of low elevation break the surface in places, but, in general, the undulating tableland slopes toward the Paraná River, the state’s western boundary.
