Lysozyme,  enzyme found in the secretions (tears) of the lacrimal glands of animals and in nasal mucus, gastric secretions, and egg white. Discovered in 1921 by Sir Alexander Fleming, lysozyme catalyzes the breakdown of certain carbohydrates found in the cell walls of certain bacteria (e.g., cocci). It thus functions, in the case of lacrimal fluid, to protect the cornea of the eye from infection.
