Caroline Julia Bartlett Crane, née Caroline Julia Bartlett  (born Aug. 17, 1858, Hudson, Wis., U.S.—died March 24, 1935, Kalamazoo, Mich.) American minister who, after a productive career in Christian social service, undertook a second successful profession in urban sanitation.
Caroline Bartlett grew up in Hudson, Wisconsin, and in Hamilton, Illinois. She graduated from Carthage College in nearby Carthage, Illinois (now in Kenosha, Wisconsin), in 1879, and, suppressing for a time her long-standing wish to enter the ministry, she then taught school for four years in Iowa. In 1884–85 she was on the staff of the Minneapolis (Minnesota) Tribune. After a brief stint as city editor of the Oshkosh (Wisconsin) Daily Times, she obtained appointment in 1886 as pastor of the small All Souls Unitarian society in Sioux Falls, Dakota Territory.
