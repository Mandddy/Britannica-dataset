Sewing machine, any of various machines for stitching material (such as cloth or leather), usually having a needle and shuttle to carry thread and powered by treadle, waterpower, or electricity. It was the first widely distributed mechanical home appliance and has been an important industrial machine.
An early sewing machine was designed and manufactured by Barthélemy Thimonnier of France, who received a patent for it by the French government in 1830, to mass-produce uniforms for the French army, but some 200 rioting tailors, who feared that the invention would ruin their businesses, destroyed the machines in 1831. Thimonnier’s design, in any event, merely mechanized the hand-sewing operation. A decisive improvement was embodied in a sewing machine built by Walter Hunt of New York City about 1832–34, which was never patented, and independently by Elias Howe of Spencer, Massachusetts, patented in 1846. In both machines a curved eye-pointed needle moved in an arc as it carried the thread through the fabric, on the other side of which it interlocked with a second thread carried by a shuttle running back and forth on a track. Howe’s highly successful machine was widely copied, leading to extensive patent litigation and ultimately to a patent pool that included the design of Isaac Merritt Singer, the largest manufacturer. In 1860 more than 110,000 sewing machines were produced in the United States alone.
