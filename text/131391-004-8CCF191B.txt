David Pinski, Yiddish Dovid Pinski, Pinski also spelled Pinsky  (born April 5, 1872, Mogilyov, Russia [now Mahilyow, Bela.]—died Aug. 11, 1959, Haifa, Israel) Russian-born playwright, novelist, and editor, one of the most noteworthy Yiddish-language dramatists.
Reared in Moscow, Vitebsk, and Vienna, Pinski moved as a young man to Warsaw, where he became a friend of the leading Yiddish writer I.L. Peretz. It was also in Warsaw that Pinski began his lifelong associations with the Jewish workers’ movement. His first short story, “Der groyser mentshenfraynd” (“The Great Philanthropist”) was published in 1894. He edited a Yiddish anthology, Literatur un lebn (“Literature and Life”), and traveled to Berlin to further his studies. In 1899 he immigrated to the United States, where he wrote for and edited several Jewish labour periodicals. After the 1903 pogrom in Kishinyov, Russia (now Chişinău, Moldv.), he also became involved in the Zionist labour movement. From 1920 to 1922 he was president of the Jewish National Workers’ Alliance, and he was president of the Jewish Culture Society from 1930 to 1953. In 1949 he moved to Haifa, Israel, and his home became a gathering place for young Yiddish writers.
