Keeling Curve, graph showing seasonal and annual changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since 1958 at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. The graph, which was devised by American climate scientist Charles David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, charts the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere. It is the longest uninterrupted instrumental record of atmospheric CO2 in the world, and it is commonly regarded as one of the best and most recognizable products of a long-term scientific study. The curve is considered by many scientists to be a trustworthy measure of CO2 in the middle layers of the troposphere, and it has been interpreted by many climate scientists as a warning signal for global warming.
Between 1958 and 1964, Keeling managed sampling efforts at Mauna Loa and at the South Pole in order to consider the changes in atmospheric CO2 occurring in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. (Sampling efforts at Mauna Loa were briefly interrupted during the spring of 1964 because of funding problems, and budget cuts forced the program at the South Pole, which had begun in 1957, to end in 1964.) Since Keeling was interested in building a record of unbiased baseline data, he chose these locations to collect air samples because they were far from substantial CO2 sources such as cities. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations were calculated daily by using infrared gas analyzers, instruments that convert infrared absorbance in each sample to CO2 concentrations in parts per million (ppm), placed at each location, and their values were charted.
