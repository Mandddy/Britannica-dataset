Bridgetown, capital and port of the island-state of Barbados, in the West Indies, southeastern Caribbean Sea. It is on the southwestern end of the island, on the wide curve of Carlisle Bay. A built-up coastal strip stretches for several miles on each side of the town.
The town, which was founded in 1628 and was originally called Indian Bridge, provoked considerable criticism from early visitors because of its location by a noxious swamp and its unplanned development. The name St. Michaelâ€™s Town came into favour about 1660 and remained in use into the 19th century. Much of the town was destroyed repeatedly by fires, and in 1854 a cholera epidemic killed some 20,000 people.
