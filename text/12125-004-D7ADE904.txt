Sergey Mikhaylovich Eisenstein,  (born January 23, 1898, Riga, Latvia, Russian Empire—died February 11, 1948, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian film director and theorist whose work includes the three film classics Potemkin (1925), Alexander Nevsky (1938), and Ivan the Terrible (released in two parts, 1944 and 1958). In his concept of film montage, images, perhaps independent of the “main” action, are presented for maximum psychological impact.
Eisenstein, who was of Jewish descent through his paternal grandparents, lived in Riga, where his father, Mikhail, a civil engineer, worked in shipbuilding until 1910, when the family moved to St. Petersburg. After studying in 1916–18 at the Institute of Civil Engineering, Eisenstein decided on a career in the plastic arts and entered the School of Fine Arts.
