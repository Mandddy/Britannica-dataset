Graham Sutherland, in full Graham Vivian Sutherland  (born August 24, 1903, London, England—died February 17, 1980, London) English painter who was best known for his Surrealistic landscapes.
Sutherland was educated at Epsom College and studied art in London (1921–25). He particularly emphasized printmaking, which he taught from 1926 to 1940 at the Chelsea School of Art. As an etcher and engraver he owes much to the Romantic painter Samuel Palmer but was influenced at different times by William Blake, Paul Nash, Henry Moore, and Pablo Picasso. His early work was characterized by an exacting representationalism that evolved into Surrealism. He turned primarily to painting in 1935 and was represented in the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition in London. From 1940 to 1945 he was an official war artist, and his paintings from that period provide a factual and evocative record of desolation.
