Étienne Pasquier,  (born June 7, 1529, Paris—died  Aug. 30, 1615, Paris) French lawyer and man of letters who is known for his Recherches de la France, 10 vol. (1560–1621), which is not only encyclopaedic but also an important work of historical scholarship.
Pasquier studied under the great Humanist legal scholars François Hotman, Jacques Cujas, and Andrea Alciato, and was called to the bar at Paris (1549) and began to practice law there. In 1557 he married a wealthy young widow whom he had defended in court. He became ill in 1560 and convalesced in Amboise and Cognac, where he began work on his Recherches, with which he was occupied, off and on, for the next 40 years.
