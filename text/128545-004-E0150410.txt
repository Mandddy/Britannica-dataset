Bornite,  a copper-ore mineral, copper and iron sulfide (Cu5FeS4). Typical occurrences are found in Mount Lyell, Tasmania; Chile; Peru; and Butte, Mont., U.S. Bornite, one of the common copper minerals, forms isometric crystals but is seldom found in these forms. It alters readily upon weathering to chalcocite and other copper minerals. For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
