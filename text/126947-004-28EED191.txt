Sir George Gilbert Scott,  (born July 13, 1811, Gawcott, Buckinghamshire, England—died March 27, 1878, London) English architect, one of the most successful and prolific exponents of the Gothic Revival style during the Victorian period.
Scott was apprenticed to a London architect and designed the first of his many churches in 1838; but his real artistic education dates from his study of A.W.N. Pugin’s works on medieval architecture. The first result of this study was his design for the Martyrs’ Memorial (1841) at Oxford. Scott won the competition for the Nikolai Church (1845–63) in Hamburg, Germany, with a design in 14th-century German Gothic. This commission launched his career and earned him an international reputation. Among his best-known works are the Albert Memorial (1863–72) and the Midland Grand Hotel (built c. 1872; later called St. Pancras Hotel) attached to St. Pancras Station, both in London. Scott’s significance rests partly on the sheer number of important buildings with which he was associated. Among the approximately 850 structures that he designed, restored, or otherwise influenced are almost 500 churches, 39 cathedrals and minsters, and many buildings for colleges and universities. Because he was the organizer and director of the largest English architectural firm of the period, Scott’s own individual designs are difficult to determine.
