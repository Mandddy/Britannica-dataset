Clement VIII, original name Ippolito Aldobrandini   (born Feb. 24, 1536, Fano, Papal States—died  March 5, 1605, Rome) pope from 1592 to 1605, the last pontiff to serve during the Counter-Reformation. The holder of numerous church offices, he was made cardinal in 1585 by Pope Sixtus V and elected pope as Clement VIII on Jan. 30, 1592.
Between 1562 and 1598, France was afflicted with civil wars between the Protestant Huguenots and Roman Catholics, which resulted in a problem of succession to the French throne. King Philip II of Spain, a power behind the Counter-Reformation, was one of the pretenders to the French throne, but he was a constant irritant to the papacy. Thus, after Henry IV’s conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1593, Clement recognized him as the rightful king of France and absolved him (Sept. 17, 1595) from excommunication. Clement then moderated the dominance of the Spanish among the cardinals, reducing their influence on future conclaves of the church. Henry IV pacified the Protestants in France and concurrently promoted the Counter-Reformation.
