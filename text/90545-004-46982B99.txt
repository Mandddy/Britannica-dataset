A Christmas Carol, also called Scrooge,  British dramatic film, released in 1951, that is widely considered the best adaptation of Charles Dickens’s classic tale of the same name. It is a perennial favourite at Christmastime, when it is frequently broadcast on television.
Dickens’s timeless tale depicts the life of Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Alastair Sim), a rich, self-obsessed miser. On Christmas Eve he is given one last chance for redemption when the ghost of his equally miserly business partner, Jacob Marley (Michael Hordern), comes back to warn him of the potentially devastating consequences of his cruel behaviour. After receiving visits from the spirits of Christmas past, present, and future, Scrooge is convinced to change. One of the first people to benefit from Scrooge’s newfound generosity is his underpaid employee, Bob Cratchit (Mervyn Johns). At his family’s Christmas dinner, Cratchit’s ill son, Tiny Tim (Glyn Dearman), delivers perhaps the film’s most memorable line, “God bless us, everyone.”
