Smithsonite, formerly calamine,  zinc carbonate (ZnCO3), a mineral that was the principal source of zinc until the 1880s, when it was replaced by sphalerite. It is ordinarily found in the oxidized zone of ore deposits as a secondary mineral or alteration product of primary zinc minerals. Notable deposits are at Laurium, Greece; Bytom and Tarnowskie GÃ³ry, Pol.; Sardinia, Italy; and Leadville, Colo., U.S. For detailed physical properties, see carbonate mineral (table).
