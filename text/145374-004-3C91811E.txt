Shuffleboard, also called shovelboard, original name shoveboard,  game in which disks are shoved by hand or with an implement so that they come to a stop on or within a scoring area marked on the board or court (on a table, floor, or outdoor hard surface such as concrete). It was popular in England as early as the 15th century, especially with the aristocracy, under the names shovegroat, slide-groat, and shovel-penny. Some of the great country houses had boards of exquisite workmanship; that at Chartley Hall in Staffordshire was more than 30 feet (9 metres) long. Shove-haâ€™penny, a later version of shovel-penny, in which a coin or disk is pushed along a polished board so that it stops between closely ruled lines, is still a popular game in English pubs.
In modern times, a modified form of the old indoor game became popular among travelers on ocean liners and cruise ships as a deck game. For the shipboard version, called shuffleboard, courts of various designs were marked on the deck, with lined sections at either end, numbered 1 to 10; the section nearest the player, called 10 off, reduced scores by 10.
