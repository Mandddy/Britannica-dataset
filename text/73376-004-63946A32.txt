Bobsledding, also called bobsleighing,  the sport of sliding down an ice-covered natural or artificial incline on a four-runner sled, called a bobsled, bobsleigh, or bob, that carries either two or four persons.
Bobsledding developed in the 1880s both in the lumbering towns of upstate New York and at the ski resorts of the Swiss Alps. The first organized competition (among teams consisting of three men and two women) was held in 1898 on the Cresta Run at Saint Moritz, Switzerland. The sport earned its name after competitors adopted the technique of bobbing back and forth to increase the speed of the sled. In 1923 bobsledding became an internationally recognized sport with the organization of the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing and with its inclusion in the first Olympic Winter Games at Chamonix, France, the following year. Since 1931 both two-person and four-person world-championship competitions have been held yearly, except during World War II. Though women have participated in bobsledding since the sport’s creation, international competition for women did not begin until the 1990s. The women’s two-person bobsled event made its Olympic debut in 2002. The gold medal for the inaugural women’s event went to Jill Bakken and Vonetta Flowers of the United States. Flowers was the first black athlete to win an Olympic gold medal at the Winter Games.
