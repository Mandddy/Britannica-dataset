Golden retriever, breed of sporting dog developed in Scotland in the 19th century as a water retriever. Typically a strong and hardy all-around dog and an excellent swimmer, it stands 21.5 to 24 inches (55 to 61 cm) and weighs 55 to 75 pounds (25 to 34 kg). Its thick coat is long on the neck, thighs, tail, and back of the legs and may be any shade of golden brown. The golden retriever was first shown in England in 1908 and was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1925. In 2002 it was the second most-popular dog breed in the United States, after the Labrador retriever. The golden retriever is noted for its friendly, gentle temperament and willingness to work. It has been trained as a guide dog for the blind and makes an excellent family pet.
