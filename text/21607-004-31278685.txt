Judy Holliday, original name Judith Tuvim  (born June 21, 1921, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 7, 1965, New York City) American actress noted for her distinctive voice and her warm, intelligent portrayal of funny and endearing “dumb blondes” on stage and in film.
Holliday’s father was a respected New York civic leader; her mother was a music teacher; and her uncle, Joseph Gollomb, was a writer. She took her stage name from the English translation of her family name, Tuvim, the Hebrew word for holiday. After working briefly as a switchboard operator for Orson Welles’s Mercury Theatre ensemble, she joined with several friends to form a comedy sketch troupe in 1939. Called the Revuers, the troupe (which included Betty Comden and Adolph Green) began performing at cafés and cabarets in New York City and later in Los Angeles and on radio. As a result of the Revuers’ success, Holliday signed a contract with Twentieth Century Fox and played bit parts in three feature films in the mid-1940s.
