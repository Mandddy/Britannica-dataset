Nicolás Antonio,  (born July 28/31, 1617, Sevilla, Spain—died April 13, 1684, Madrid) first systematic historian of Spanish literature. His Bibliotheca Hispana appeared in two parts (Nova, 1672; Vetus, 1696). The first is a vast bibliography of Peninsular and Spanish colonial writers after 1500, with critical evaluations. The second, a history of Peninsular literature from the reign of Augustus to 1500, marks the emergence of modern bibliography and the transformation of literary history into a scholarly discipline. A second edition (1788; vol. 1 of the Nova dated 1783), with additions from Antonio’s manuscripts, is still consulted.
