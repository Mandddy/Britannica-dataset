Curly-coated retriever, breed of sporting dog bred and trained to retrieve game both on land and in the water. Developed in England from water spaniels and retrievers, it is one of the oldest retriever breeds, first exhibited in the United Kingdom in 1860. Its distinctive coat is either black or liver, covering the dog in short, tight curls except for its forehead, face, lower forelegs, and feet. It stands 23 to 27 inches (58 to 68.5 cm) and weighs 60 to 80 pounds (27 to 36 kg). The breed was first registered by the American Kennel Club in 1924. The curly-coated retriever is sturdy, intelligent, and trainable; its temperament makes it an ideal family dog as well as a tireless worker in the field. The curly-coated retriever is a popular hunting dog in New Zealand and Australia.
