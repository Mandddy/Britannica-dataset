Julius III, original name Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte   (born Sept. 10, 1487, Rome [Italy]â€”died  March 23, 1555, Rome) pope from 1550 to 1555.
As a cardinal, he served as co-president of the Council of Trent in 1545, with cardinals Cervini (later Pope Marcellus II) and Pole. Elected pope on Feb. 7, 1550, he realized that a reform of the church was urgent, and he appointed a commission that recommended resumption of the Council of Trent, which Julius reopened on May 1, 1551. Unfortunately, military and political problems led to its second suspension in 1552. He attempted to stop cardinals from receiving too many benefices and to restore monastic discipline.
