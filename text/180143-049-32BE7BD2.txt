Candy, also called confectionery,  sweet food product. The application of the terms candy and confectionery varies among English-speaking countries. In the United States candy refers to both chocolate products and sugar-based confections; elsewhere “chocolate confectionery” refers to chocolates, “sugar confectionery” to the various sugar-based products, and “flour confectionery” to such products as cakes and pastries. This article is primarily concerned with sugar confectionery. Other types of confections are discussed in the articles baking and cocoa.
Egyptian hieroglyphics dating back at least 3,000 years indicate that the art of sugar confectionery was already established. The confectioner was regarded as a skilled craftsman by the Romans, and a confectioner’s kitchen excavated at Herculaneum was equipped with pots, pans, and other implements similar to those in use today.
