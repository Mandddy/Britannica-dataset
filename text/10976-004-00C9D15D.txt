Friedrich Hölderlin, in full Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin  (born March 20, 1770, Lauffen am Neckar, Württemberg [Germany]—died June 7, 1843, Tübingen) German lyric poet who succeeded in naturalizing the forms of classical Greek verse in German and in melding Christian and classical themes.
Hölderlin was born in a little Swabian town on the River Neckar. His father died in 1772, and two years afterward his mother married the burgomaster of the town of Nürtingen, where Friedrich attended school. But his mother was again widowed, in 1779, and left alone to bring up her family—which included Friedrich, his sister Heinrike, and his half-brother Karl. His mother, a parson’s daughter and a woman of simple and rather narrow piety, wanted Friedrich to enter the service of the church. Candidates for the ministry received free education, and accordingly he was sent first to the “monastery schools” (so called since pre-Reformation times) at Denkendorf and Maulbronn and subsequently (1788–93) to the theological seminary in the University of Tübingen, where he obtained his master’s degree and qualified for ordination.
