Swordfish,  (Xiphias gladius), prized food and game fish, probably the single species constituting the family Xiphiidae (order Perciformes), found in warm and temperate oceans around the world. The swordfish, an elongated, scaleless fish, has a tall dorsal fin, and a long sword, used in slashing at prey fishes, extends from its snout. The sword is flat, rather than rounded as in marlins and other spear-nosed fishes, and has thus given rise to the name broadbill. The swordfish is also distinguished by its lack of pelvic fins and of teeth. It is purplish or bluish above, silvery below, and grows to a maximum length of about 4.6 metres (15 feet) and a maximum weight of about 450 kilograms (1,000 pounds).
