Roger de Bussy-Rabutin, in full Roger de Rabutin, comte (count) de Bussy  (born April 13, 1618, Épiry, France—died April 9, 1693, Autun) French libertine who amused the nobility of his time with scandalous tales told in a light classical prose style; he was the cousin and confidant of the celebrated letter writer Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné.
During the civil wars of the Fronde (uprisings against the government of Cardinal Mazarin), Bussy-Rabutin served first the rebels, then the government. Although his raffish escapades got him into trouble, he was nevertheless allowed to buy the exalted rank of lieutenant colonel general of the light cavalry in 1653 and was elected to the French Academy in 1665.
