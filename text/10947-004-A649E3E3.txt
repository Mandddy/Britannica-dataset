Richard Hooker,  (born March 1554?, Heavitree, Exeter, Devon, England—died November 2, 1600, Bishopsbourne, near Canterbury, Kent) theologian who created a distinctive Anglican theology and who was a master of English prose and legal philosophy. In his masterpiece, Of the Lawes of Ecclesiasticall Politie, which was incomplete at the time of his death, Hooker defended the Church of England against both Roman Catholicism and Puritanism and affirmed the Anglican tradition as that of a “threefold cord not quickly broken”—Bible, church, and reason.
Hooker was born at the end of 1553 or the beginning of 1554 near the city of Exeter, Devon. His family lacked the financial means to send him to the University of Oxford, but, with John Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, as his patron, in 1568 Hooker entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford. The dominant influence in the Church of England at that time was John Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian Religion, and thus Hooker was trained in the traditions of Genevan Protestantism. Leading scholars at Oxford were, however, loyal to the Anglican Book of Common Prayer and used the vestments demanded by the ecclesiastical law of the realm. Hooker, a staunch Anglican, went beyond even liberal Calvinism and read the best scriptural interpretation of his day, the early Church Fathers, and even Renaissance Thomism (the philosophical school influenced by the thought of St. Thomas Aquinas). He thus avoided the limits of narrow academic Calvinism and became a man of wide Renaissance learning. Hooker said that he grew in his opinions and gave up narrow conceptions previously held. Hooker became a scholar of Corpus Christi College in 1573, took his M.A. in 1577, and became a fellow of the college that same year.
