Walter Matthau, original name Walter Matuschanskavasky  (born October 1, 1920, New York, N.Y., U.S.â€”died July 1, 2000, Santa Monica, Calif.) American actor known for his rumpled face, nasal bray, and razor-sharp timing.
Born into a family of Jewish-Russian immigrants, he was compelled to work at a very early age. By the time he was 11, he was employed at the concession stand in a Lower East Side Yiddish theatre. To pick up extra money, he began playing bit roles, making his debut as an 80-year-old woman in a crowd scene. After high school, he held down a variety of jobs, but his heart remained in the theatre. During World War II, he served with distinction under the command of Colonel James Stewart. Upon his return he attended the New School for Social Research Dramatic Workshop, where his fellow students included Rod Steiger, Eli Wallach, Tony Curtis, and Harry Belafonte. In 1946 he made his first professional appearance, and within two years he was acting on Broadway, playing two roles and understudying seven characters in Anne of the Thousand Days.
