Hex sign, emblem painted on a barn, especially in Pennsylvania Dutch country, an agricultural region in southeastern Pennsylvania largely settled by German immigrants who have preserved ethnic custom and identification to a high degree (see Pennsylvania German). Hex designs, usually round, with colourful, simple floral and geometric motifs, are said to protect farm animals from disease and other misfortunes resulting from witchesâ€™ spells and especially the evil eye.
