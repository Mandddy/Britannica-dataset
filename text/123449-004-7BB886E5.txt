Dyckia,  genus of usually stemless plants of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae), consisting of about 80 South American species. These plants’ long, stiff leaves, which grow in dense rosettes, are spiny-edged, sharp-tipped, and often fleshy. The small flowers usually are yellow or orange. Two species, D. rariflora and D. sulphurea (D. brevifolia), are commonly cultivated indoors as decorative plants. The leaves of both species are about 10–20 cm (about 4–8 inches) long and less than 0.8 cm ( 1/3 inch) wide. The flowers of D. rariflora are in a nearly stalkless cluster about 45 cm (17 inches) high that rises from the rosette. The flower stalk of D. sulphurea rises about 30 cm (12 inches) and bears 30 to 40 yellow blooms.
