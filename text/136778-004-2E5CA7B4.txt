Panj River, also spelled Pyandzh River,  headstream of the Amu Darya in Central Asia. It is 700 miles (1,125 km) long and constitutes part of the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The Panj River is formed between the Hindu Kush and the Pamir Mountains by the junction of the Vākhān River and the Pamir River along the border between eastern Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The climate of the Panj River valley is arid, averaging less than 8 inches (200 mm) of precipitation per year. Annual precipitation is much greater—more than 28 inches (700 mm)—in the surrounding high mountains, which provide most of the water flowing to the Panj. In the Hindu Kush and the Pamirs, precipitation falls mainly in winter as snow that sustains numerous glaciers. Melting glaciers and snow fields feed the Panj River, which crests in late spring. The river flows southwest, then north, and finally southwest again, joining the Vakhsh River to form the Amu Darya.
