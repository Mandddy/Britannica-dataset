Fredrik Størmer, in full Fredrik Carl Mülertz Størmer  (born September 3, 1874, Skien, Norway—died August 13, 1957, Oslo) Norwegian geophysicist and mathematician who developed a mathematical theory of auroral phenomena.
Professor of pure mathematics at the University of Christiania (Oslo, after 1924) from 1903 to 1946, Størmer began his mathematical work with studies of series, function theory, and number theory. He produced a number of papers on pure mathematics, and many of his results are of considerable importance. In 1895 he demonstrated that there are only four nontrivial solutions for the equation m tan−1(1/x) + n tan-1(1/y) = kπ/4, in which m, n, k, x, and y are integers.
