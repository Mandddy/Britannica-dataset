Customs union, a trade agreement by which a group of countries charges a common set of tariffs to the rest of the world while granting free trade among themselves. It is a partial form of economic integration that offers an intermediate step between free-trade zones (which allow mutual free trade but lack a common tariff system) and common markets (which, in addition to the common tariffs, also allow free movement of resources such as capital and labour between member countries). A free-trade zone with common tariffs is a customs union.
It has long been recognized that tariff barriers generally reduce the quantity of trade between countries. Under most circumstances this reduction in trade protects certain domestic producers, but it also translates into higher costs for consumers in both the importing and the exporting country. Many governments attempt to resolve this problem by protecting politically favoured producers while also reducing consumer costs. Customs unions, along with other forms of partial economic integration, offer one means of achieving that balance.
