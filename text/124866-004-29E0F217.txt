Clement VI, original name Pierre Roger   (born c. 1291, Corrèze, Aquitaine [France]—died  Dec. 6, 1352, Avignon, Provence) pope from 1342 to 1352.
Abbot of the Benedictine monasteries at Fécamp and La Chaise-Dieu, France, he became archbishop of Sens in 1329 and of Rouen in 1330. He was made cardinal in 1338 by Pope Benedict XII, whom he succeeded, being consecrated at Avignon on May 19, 1342. His pontificate was confronted by three problems: the last of the Crusades, the failure of the Florentine bankers, and the state of papal possessions in Italy.
