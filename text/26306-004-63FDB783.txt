Shāpūr II, byname Shāpūr The Great   (born ad 309—died  379) 10th king of the Sāsānian Empire of Persia, who withstood Roman strength by astute military strategy and diplomacy and brought the empire to the zenith of its power.
The name Shāpūr, meaning “son of a king,” was common in the Sāsānian period and was often given to sons other than princes. Numerical designations were not used to distinguish kings of the same name; instead, the family genealogy was cited. Thus, in one inscription, Shāpūr styles himself,the Mazdāh-worshipping god Shāpūr, king of kings of Iran and non-Iran, who is a scion of the Gods, the son of Hormizd (Ormizd II), the grandson of Narses.
