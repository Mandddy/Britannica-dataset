Cino Da Pistoia, original name Cino Dei Sighibuldi  (born c. 1270, Pistoia, near Florence [Italy]—died  1336/37, Pistoia) Italian jurist, poet, and prose writer whose poetry, written in the dolce stil nuovo (“sweet new style”), was admired by Dante and was a great influence on Petrarch.
Born into an aristocratic Pistoian family, Cino studied law at the University of Bologna. He became involved in Pistoian politics and was exiled for six years, after which he became ambassador to Florence. A supporter of Henry VII on his coming to Italy in 1310 to be crowned Holy Roman emperor, Cino returned to law studies when Henry died in 1313. With the completion of his highly praised Latin commentary, Lectura in Codicem (“Studies on the Code”), on the first nine books of Justinian’s Codex Constitutionum, Cino received his doctorate in law (1314) at the University of Bologna and then taught law at the universities of Siena, Bologna, Florence, Perugia, and Naples. In 1334 he returned to Pistoia, where he spent the rest of his life.
