Radnorshire, Welsh Sir Faesyfed,  historic county, east-central Wales, on the English border. It covers an area of mountainous terrain and highlands, including Radnor Forest, with a central valley formed by the River Wye. Radnorshire lies completely within the present county of Powys.
Burial mounds and Iron Age hill forts attest to a prehistoric presence in Radnorshire. When the Romans conquered the area during the 1st century ce, it was inhabited by the Ordovices. The Romans maintained a military occupation of the region for three centuries. There are ruins of a Roman villa outside the town of Knighton and the remains of a Roman fort, Castell Collen, near the town of Llandrindod Wells. After the Roman withdrawal the Anglo-Saxons invaded Great Britain, and Radnorshire became a refuge of the Britons, the ancestors of the Welsh. The limit of the Anglo-Saxon conquests during the early Middle Ages, Offaâ€™s Dyke, lines the border between Radnorshire and England. The county was contested by the Welsh princes of Powys and Brycheiniog. The Normans conquered much of Radnorshire in the late 1000s, and it became part of the Welsh Marches (border country between Wales and England). The 12th and 13th centuries saw almost continuous fighting in the area until Edward I of England defeated the Welsh in the 14th century.
