Hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), large African antelope (family Bovidae) with an elongated head, unusual bracket-shaped horns, and high forequarters sloping to lower hindquarters—a trait of the tribe Alcelaphini, which also includes wildebeests, the topi, and the blesbok. DNA studies indicate that there are about 10 subspecies of Alcelaphus buselaphus, including some that were formerly recognized as separate species of Alcelaphus.
Hartebeest are found in herds on open plains and scrublands of sub-Saharan Africa. Once the widest-ranging of African antelopes, they also once lived in North Africa. One well-known variety, Coke’s hartebeest, or the kongoni (A. buselaphus cokei), of East Africa, is the plainest and smallest subspecies, measuring 117 cm (46 inches) high and weighing 142 kg (312 pounds). This subspecies is lion-coloured, with no conspicuous markings except a white rump patch; it has a moderately elongated head and comparatively uncomplicated horns. The red hartebeest (A. buselaphus caama) of southwest Africa is the most colourful, with extensive black markings setting off a white belly and rump; it has a more elongated head and high horns that curve in a complex pattern and are joined at the base. The largest hartebeest is the western hartebeest (A. buselaphus tora), which weighs 228 kg (502 pounds) and stands 143 cm (56 inches) tall. Females are 12 percent smaller than males, with smaller but similarly shaped horns.
