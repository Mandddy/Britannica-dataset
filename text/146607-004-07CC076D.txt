Shock absorber, also called Snubber,  device for controlling unwanted motion of a spring-mounted vehicle. On an automobile, for example, the springs act as a cushion between the axles and the body and reduce the shocks on the body produced by a rough road surface. Some combinations of road surface and car speed may result in excessive up-and-down motion of the car body. Shock absorbers slow down and reduce the magnitude of these vibratory motions. Modern shock absorbers are hydraulic devices that oppose both the compression and the stretch of the springs. The direct-acting, or strut, type is attached to the vehicle frame and the axle by two eyes. One eye is attached to a piston that slides in an oil-filled cylinder attached to the other eye. Any relative motion between the frame and the axle causes the piston to act against the oil in the cylinder. This oil has to leak through small openings or pass through a spring-loaded valve. In this way, a force is created that opposes the contraction and stretching of the springs, and the vibration of the body is dampened.
