Gifted child, any child who is naturally endowed with a high degree of general mental ability or extraordinary ability in a specific sphere of activity or knowledge. The designation of giftedness is largely a matter of administrative convenience. In most countries the prevailing definition is an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 130 or above. Increasingly, however, schools use multiple measures of giftedness and assess a wide variety of talents, including verbal, mathematical, spatial-visual, musical, and interpersonal abilities.
In countries that make special provision for educating gifted pupils, the prevailing method of selection consists of written tests. Although standard IQ tests are the most commonly used means of identifying gifted children, other tests of both intelligence and creativity are also used. Tests vary widely in their validity and reliability for different ages and cultures; therefore, fair identification procedures always take into account a wide variety of behaviours that may be signs of giftedness.
