Pontifical Gregorian University, Latin Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana, bynames The Greg or Gregorian University,  Roman Catholic institution of higher learning in Rome. It was founded in 1551 as the Collegium Romanum (College of Rome) by St. Ignatius of Loyola and St. Francis Borgia and was constituted as a university by Pope Julius III. It received its present name as the result of the efforts of Pope Gregory XIII, who considerably expanded the institution in 1567. The university’s rector is appointed by the pope, and the majority of its professors, who come from all over the world, are Jesuits. The Pontifical Gregorian University functions primarily as an institution of higher learning for the Roman Catholic clergy, though others are not excluded. Among the university’s graduates are 24 canonized saints, 16 popes, and 50 persons who have been beatified. Faculties include theology, canon law, philosophy, history and cultural heritage of the church, missiology, and social sciences; the school also has institutes of psychology and spirituality.
