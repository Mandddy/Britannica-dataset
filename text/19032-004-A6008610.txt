Matthias de L’Obel, L’Obel also spelled Lobel, also called Matthaeus Lobelius  (born 1538, Lille, Flanders (now in France)—died March 3, 1616, Highgate, London, England) Flemish-born physician and botanist whose Stirpium adversaria nova (1570; written in collaboration with Pierre Pena) was a milestone in modern botany. It argued that botany and medicine must be based on thorough, exact observation.
L’Obel studied at the University of Montpellier (France) with Guillaume Rondolet. The Stirpium adversaria, a collection of data about some 1,200 plants that L’Obel had observed and gathered, tried to classify plants into families according to the form of their leaves. L’Obel’s rough notions of genus and family were later developed by Carolus Linnaeus; a few of L’Obel’s plant groups are still recognized. Plantarum seu stirpium historia, 2 vol. (1576), comprised the second edition of the Stirpium adversaria together with the Stirpium observationes, an appendix with 1,486 engravings by botanists such as Pietro Mattioli, Rembert Dodoens, and Charles de l’Écluse.
