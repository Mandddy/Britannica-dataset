Timothy McVeigh, in full Timothy James McVeigh  (born April 23, 1968, Pendleton, N.Y., U.S.—died June 11, 2001, Terre Haute, Ind.) American militant who carried out the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. The explosion, which killed 168 people, was the deadliest terrorist incident on U.S. soil, until the September 11 attacks in 2001.
McVeigh was the middle child in a blue-collar family in rural New York state, and he expressed an interest in guns from an early age. He graduated from high school in June 1986 and spent a short period at a local business college. Around this time he first read The Turner Diaries (1978), an antigovernment, neo-Nazi tract written by William Pierce. The book, which details the truck-bombing of the Washington, D.C., headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), fueled McVeigh’s paranoia about a government plot to repeal the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the right “to keep and bear arms.” He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1988 and proved to be a model soldier, earning a Bronze Star for bravery in the Persian Gulf War (1990–91). He was a candidate for the Special Forces but dropped out of the program after only two days. The experience soured him on the military, and he took an early discharge and left the army in late 1991.
