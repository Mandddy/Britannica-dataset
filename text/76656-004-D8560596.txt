Gigi, comedy of manners by Colette, published in 1944. While Gigi’s mother works as a second-rate theatre singer, Gigi is left in the care of her grandmother and great-aunt, both retired courtesans. They endeavour to teach Gigi the family business: pleasing men. The two decide to ask Gaston, the bored, fatuous, wealthy son of one of the grandmother’s former lovers, to initiate Gigi into her courtesan career. Gigi, furious, refuses, but after Gaston reappears she realizes that she loves him and tells him so. He proposes marriage, and love conquers all.
