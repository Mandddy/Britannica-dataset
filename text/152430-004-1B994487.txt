Lin Zexu, Wade-Giles romanization Lin Tse-hsü, courtesy name (zi) Shaomu  (born August 30, 1785, Houguan [now Fuzhou], Fujian province, China—died November 22, 1850, Chaozhou, Guangdong province) leading Chinese scholar and official of the Qing (Manchu) dynasty, known for his role in the events leading up to the first Opium War (1839–42) between Britain and China. He was a proponent of the revitalization of traditional Chinese thought and institutions, a movement that became known as the Self-Strengthening Movement.
Lin’s father was a teacher, who, though poor, was determined that his sons should have the grounding in the Confucian Classics that alone could advance them in the governmental bureaucracy. Lin Zexu, the second son, proved immensely capable and passed the initial examinations in 1804. He then was selected as an aide to the governor of his native province, an informal apprenticeship that served to balance the abstract, moral, and largely literary content of his early education. In 1811 Lin passed the highest of the examinations, the jinshi, and joined the Hanlin Academy, which advised the emperor and helped him to draft documents. In 1820 Lin took up his first regular administrative post and rose through a number of the most responsible offices in the bureaucracy. After starting in the salt monopoly, he supervised water-control systems in several localities, administered the collection of taxes, and served a term as a local judge, during which he earned the respectful nickname “Lin the Clear Sky.” Lin’s quick rise showed him to be an effective organizer and ambitious bureaucrat.
