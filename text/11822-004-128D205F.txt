Flight shooting, in archery, a form of competition in which shooting for maximum distance is the object, with little or no regard for accuracy. Bows used may be heavy-draw, conventional handbows or even heavier foot bows, which are strapped to the feet and drawn with both hands while the archer lies on the ground. Crossbows are also used. Contestants are grouped in classes according to the pulling weight of their bows. Modern flight bows are composite (made of more than one materialâ€”e.g., wood and fibreglass). Arrows are as light as possible, usually made of wood or aluminum with a barreled shape (tapered at the ends, thicker in the middle) and fitted with small plastic vanes. Modern flight shooters, whose records advance with technological improvements of bows and arrows, have shot beyond 1 mile (1.6 km).
