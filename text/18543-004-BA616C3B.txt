National Gallery, art museum in London that houses Great Britain’s national collection of European paintings. It is located on the north side of Trafalgar Square, Westminster.
The National Gallery was founded in 1824 when the British government bought a collection of 38 paintings from the estate of the merchant John Julius Angerstein (1735–1823). The collection was first exhibited on May 10 of that year in Angerstein’s house at 100 Pall Mall, but in 1838 it was reopened to the public in its current premises. This Neoclassical structure, designed by the Greek Revival architect William Wilkins, was enlarged in 1860, 1876, 1886, and 1975 and in 1991 with the addition of the Sainsbury Wing, by the American architect Robert Venturi. Until the opening of the Tate Gallery in 1897, modern British art was also displayed at the National Gallery. Since 1856 the National Gallery also has had responsibility for the historical portraits housed in the National Portrait Gallery.
