Dakar Rally, automobile rally race over a route traditionally run through southern Europe and Africa before finishing in Dakar, Seneg. The Dakar Rally, first held in 1978â€“79, covers up to 15,000 km (9,300 miles) and is considered among the most grueling rally events. In 2009 the Dakar Rally was relocated to South America after its organizers, citing terrorist threats in Africa, cancelled the 2008 race.
