Peter Barlow,  (born October 13, 1776, Norwich, Norfolk, England—died March 1, 1862, Kent) optician and mathematician who invented two varieties of achromatic (non-colour-distorting) telescope lenses known as Barlow lenses.
Self-educated, he became assistant mathematics master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1801. He published numerous mathematical works, including New Mathematical Tables (1814). Later known as Barlow’s Tables, this compilation of factors and functions of all numbers from 1 to 10,000 was considered so accurate and so useful that it has been regularly reprinted ever since.
