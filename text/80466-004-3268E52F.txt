Chalgrin was trained by the celebrated architect E.-L. Boullée and in the office of Giovanni Niccolò Servandoni. He took the Academy of Architecture’s Grand Prix de Rome in 1758 at age 19, traveled to Rome the following year, and returned to France in 1763. His patrons included the Count de Saint-Florentin, for whose mistress Chalgrin built a house on the Champs-Élysées that was subsequently leased by Thomas Jefferson during the years that he served as U.S. minister to the French government.
