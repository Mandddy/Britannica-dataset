John Garfield, original name Jacob Julius Garfinkle  (born March 4, 1913, New York, New York, U.S.—died May 21, 1952, New York City) American film and stage actor who is best known for his intense portrayals of rebels and antiheroes.
Garfield grew up in the poor Jewish section of New York City’s Lower East Side. Street-gang involvement and numerous fistfights landed him in a reform school during his teen years, where he soon blossomed in forensic and athletic activities. A scholarship he won in a statewide New York Times-sponsored debating contest allowed him to attend the American Laboratory School, where he studied acting under Maria Ouspenskaya. His restless nature led him to live as a train-hopping vagrant during the early 1930s, but he returned to New York in 1932 and joined Eva Le Gallienne’s prestigious Civic Repertory Theatre. With that troupe, and under the name of Jules Garfield, he made his Broadway debut with a small part in the play Lost Boy (1933).
