University of Dublin, also called Trinity College,  oldest university in Ireland, founded in 1592 by Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland and endowed by the city of Dublin. When founded, it was intended that Trinity College would be the first of many constituent colleges of the University of Dublin. No other colleges were established, however, and the two names became interchangeable. The full benefits of the university—degrees, fellowships, scholarships, and emoluments—were limited to Anglicans for many years, but in 1873 all religious requirements were eliminated. The university library contains many illuminated manuscripts, including the famous Book of Kells.
