Spaniel, any of several sporting dogs used by hunters to flush game from cover. The earliest spaniels apparently originated in Spain, hence the name, but most of the modern breeds were developed in Britain. The distinction between spaniel breeds originally was one of size, the larger spaniels being called springers and the smaller ones cockersâ€”the latter apparently in reference to their use in flushing woodcocks. They are also distinguished by function as land spaniels and water spaniels. Toy spaniels do not hunt but are valued companions.
