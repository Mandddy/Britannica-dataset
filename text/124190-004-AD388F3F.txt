Cornflower (Centaurea cyanus), also called bachelor’s button,  herbaceous annual plant of the Asteraceae family. Native to Europe, cornflowers are widely cultivated in North America as garden plants and have naturalized as an invasive species in some areas. The plants, 30–90 cm (1–3 feet) tall with narrow gray-green leaves, produce papery flower heads surrounded by bracts. The flower heads have blue, pink, or white rays that are attractive to butterflies and are commonly used as a fresh or dried flower in bouquets.
