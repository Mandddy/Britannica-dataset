Ceres, dwarf planet, the largest asteroid in the main asteroid belt, and the first asteroid to be discovered. Ceres was found, serendipitously, by the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi of the Palermo Observatory on January 1, 1801. Additional observations of the object by Piazzi were cut short by illness, but Ceres was recovered on January 1, 1802, by the German Hungarian astronomer Franz von Zach, using an orbit calculated by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. Ceres was named after the ancient Roman grain goddess and the patron goddess of Sicily.
Ceres revolves around the Sun once in 4.61 Earth years in a nearly circular, moderately inclined (10.6°) orbit at a mean distance of 2.77 astronomical units (AU; about 414 million km [257 million miles]). Although it—and the next two asteroids discovered, Pallas and Juno—is located near the distance predicted by Bode’s law for the “missing” planet between Mars and Jupiter, most asteroids found subsequently are not so located, and so the agreement with that “law” appears to be coincidental.
