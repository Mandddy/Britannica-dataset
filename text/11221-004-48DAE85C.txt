G.H. Hardy, in full Godfrey Harold Hardy  (born February 7, 1877, Cranleigh, Surrey, Englandâ€”died December 1, 1947, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) leading English pure mathematician whose work was mainly in analysis and number theory.
Hardy graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1899, became a fellow at Trinity in 1900, and lectured there in mathematics from 1906 to 1919. In 1912 Hardy published, with John E. Littlewood, the first of a series of papers that contributed fundamentally to many realms in mathematics, including the theory of Diophantine analysis, divergent series summation (see infinite series), Fourier series, the Riemann zeta function, and the distribution of primes. The collaboration between Hardy and Littlewood is one of the most celebrated in 20th-century mathematics.
