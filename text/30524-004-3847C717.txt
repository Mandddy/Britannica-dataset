William E. Borah, in full William Edgar Borah   (born June 29, 1865, Fairfield, Ill., U.S.—died  Jan. 19, 1940, Washington, D.C.) Republican U.S. senator from Idaho for 33 years, best known for his major role at the end of World War I (1918) in preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations and the World Court.
Borah practiced law in Boise, Idaho, and in 1892 became chairman of the Republican State Central Committee. He first won election to the U.S. Senate in 1906 and was returned to office five times by large majorities, making his tenure one of the longest in U.S. history. Borah’s distrust of government centralization limited his commitment to social reform, but he did sponsor bills establishing the Department of Labor as well as the federal Children’s Bureau. He also strongly supported the federal income tax and fought the trusts.
