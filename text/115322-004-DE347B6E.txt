Khāqānī, in full Afẓal al-Dīn Bādil Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAlī Khāqānī Shīrvānī   (born c. 1106, Shīrvān, Seljuq empire [now Azerbaijan]—died c. 1190, Tabrīz, Iran) Persian poet, whose importance rests mainly on his brilliant court poems, satires, and epigrams.
His father was a carpenter and a Muslim and his mother was of Nestorian Christian origin. Brought up in poverty, he was fortunate to be educated by his learned uncle. As a young man he composed lyrics under the name of Ḥaqāʾīqī (“Seeker of Truth”). He then gained entry into the court of the ruler of Shīrvān, the khāqān, Manūchehr, from whom he took his pen name, Khāqānī.
