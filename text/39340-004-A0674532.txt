Pius VIII, original name Francesco Saverio Castiglioni   (born Nov. 20, 1761, Cingoli, Papal States—died  Nov. 30, 1830, Rome) Italian pope from March 1829 to November 1830.
Versed in canon law, he became vicar general at Anagni, and later at Fano, until 1800, when he was made bishop of Montalto by Pope Pius VII. He was imprisoned in 1808 during the French domination of Italy for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Napoleon. In 1816 he was elevated to cardinal and appointed bishop of Cesena. He subsequently became bishop of Frascati and grand penitentiary (1821), a leading role in the Curia. Despite his ill health, Francesco, the candidate of France, was elected Pope Leo XII’s successor on March 31, 1829, and was crowned on the following April 5.
