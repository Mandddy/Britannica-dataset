Rex Stewart, in full Rex William Stewart, Jr.   (born Feb. 22, 1907, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Sept. 7, 1967, Los Angeles, Calif.) black American jazz musician unique for playing the cornet, rather than the trumpet, in big bands as well as small groups throughout his career. His mastery of expressive effects made him one of the most distinctive of all brass improvisers.
Stewart grew up in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and began playing in New York City groups in 1921. The most important of his early associations was with the classic Fletcher Henderson band (1926, periodically in 1928–33) and McKinney’s Cotton Pickers (1931–32). His greatest work took place during his years with the Duke Ellington band (1934–45), when he was featured in recordings such as “Across the Track Blues” and “Boy Meets Horn.”
