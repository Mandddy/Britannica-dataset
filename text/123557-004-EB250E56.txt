National Roman Museum, Italian Museo Nazionale Romano,  in Rome, one of the world’s greatest museums of ancient Greco-Roman art, founded in 1889 and housed in a monastery restored by Michelangelo on the site of the baths of Diocletian. The museum is also known as the Terme Museum after the Terme (thermal baths) of Diocletian. It contains antiquities discovered in Rome since 1870, as well as the treasures of the Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi collection in the cloister known as the Boncompagni. The museum’s important collection of sculpture includes a large number of Roman copies of lost Greek works as well as a few important Greek originals. There is the Venus of Cyrene, an original Greek work of the 4th century bc, depicting the goddess Venus risen from the sea with her cloak supported by a dolphin near her right leg, possibly by a predecessor of Praxiteles. The Torso Valentini, representing a hero or athlete, and the Ludovisi Throne are both from the 5th century bc. The Head of Hypnos is attributed to Praxiteles, and there is the fine Boxer Resting, signed by Apollonius. The Maiden of Anzio, of the school of Lysippus, was found at Anzio in 1878. The sculpture represents a young girl approaching an altar. Important Roman copies include two examples of the discus thrower by Myron, the Discobolos of Castel Porziano and the Discobolos ex-Lancelotti. The Daughter of Niobe is an original Greek example of the 5th century bc. Examples of Roman sculpture include many portrait busts and the famous Altar from Ostia relief showing the origin of Rome. The Head of Vespasian from Ostia is one of the finest of all Roman portrait busts.
