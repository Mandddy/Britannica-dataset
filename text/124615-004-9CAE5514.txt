Sir David Stirling, original name Archibald David Stirling  (born November 15, 1915, Stirlingshire? [now in Stirling], Scotlandâ€”died November 4, 1990, London, England) British army officer who founded and led the elite British Special Air Service (SAS) regiment during World War II.
The son of a brigadier general, Stirling attended Trinity College, Cambridge, for a year; in 1939 he joined the Scots Guard Supplementary Reserve of Officers and the next year the commando Brigade of Guards in the Middle East. In Egypt he persuaded his superiors to let him form a unit to make quick raids against the enemy, using the vast desert as cover. He was promoted to the rank of major, and with 6 officers and 60 enlisted men he formed the SAS, which proved exceptionally successful: German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel lost hundreds of aircraft and scores of supply posts to SAS raids. Stirling was captured (1943) in Tunisia and escaped four times before he was transferred to Colditz Castle prison camp for the remainder of the war.
