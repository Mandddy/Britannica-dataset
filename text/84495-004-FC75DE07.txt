Meghna River, major watercourse of the Padma River (Ganges [Ganga] River) delta, in Bangladesh. The name is properly applied to a channel of the Old Brahmaputra downstream from Bhairab Bazar, after it has received the Surma (Barak) River. Flowing almost due south, the Meghna receives the combined waters of the Padma and Jamuna (the name of the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh) rivers near Chandpur. After a course of about 164 miles (264 km) it enters the Bay of Bengal by four principal mouthsâ€”Tetulia, Shahbazpur, Hatia, and Bamni. Major tributaries are the Dhaleswari, the Gumti (the name of the Gomati in Bangladesh), and the Feni. A river of great depth and velocity, the Meghna is sometimes split up into several channels and sandbanks of its own formation. It is navigable, but dangerous, all year. At spring tide the sea rushes upriver in a bore that may reach nearly 20 feet (6 metres).
