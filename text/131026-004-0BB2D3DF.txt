Growth, the increases in cell size and number that take place during the life history of an organism.
Growth is seldom random. Rather, it occurs according to a plan that eventually determines the size and shape of the individual. Growth may be restricted to special regions of the organism, such as the layers of cells that divide and increase in size near the tip of the plant shoot. Or the cells engaged in growth may be widely distributed throughout the body of the organism, as in the human embryo. In the latter case, the rates of cell division and of the increase in cell size differ in different parts. That the pattern of growth is predetermined and regular in plants and animals can be seen in the forms of adults. In some organisms, however, notably the slime molds, no regular pattern of growth occurs, and a formless cytoplasmic mass is the result.
