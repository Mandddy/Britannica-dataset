Michel Fokine, original name Mikhail Mikhaylovich Fokine   (born April 23 [April 11, old style], 1880, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  Aug. 22, 1942, New York City) dancer and choreographer who profoundly influenced the 20th-century classical ballet repertoire. In 1905 he composed the solo The Dying Swan for the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. As chief choreographer for the impresario Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes from 1909 to 1914, he created L’Oiseau de feu (1910; The Firebird) and Petrushka (1911).
Fokine was born of a prosperous middle-class family and entered the Imperial Ballet School at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1889, where he distinguished himself for the breadth of his interests and studies. Fokine was talented not only as a dancer but also as a student of music and painting. He had a fresh and inquiring attitude toward everything connected with the ballet and began quite early to plan choreography, to seek appropriate music in the school library, and to sketch designs. His development as a dancer—he made his debut with the Imperial Russian Ballet on his 18th birthday—was paralleled by his development as a choreographer and designer.
