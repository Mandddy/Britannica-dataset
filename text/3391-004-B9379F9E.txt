Parrotbill (family Paradoxornithidae), also called crow-tit ,  any of several species of small to medium titmouselike birds, mostly brown and gray with soft, loose plumage and distinctive strongly arched, parrotlike bills. They live in brushy grasslands of Central and Eastern Asia.
A well-known garden bird in Chinese cities is the vinous-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis webbianus). Ranging from Manchuria south through China and Korea to Myanmar (Burma), it frequents bamboo groves, tea plantations, and scrub, as well as gardens. Searching out seeds, it moves in large flocks through the undergrowth and stays in contact with constant sharp chirruping calls.
