Raven, any of several species of heavy-billed, dark birds, larger than crows. Closely related, both ravens and crows are species of the genus Corvus. The raven has a heavier bill and shaggier plumage than the crow, especially around the throat. The raven’s lustrous feathers also have a blue or purplish iridescence.
The common raven (C. corax) is the largest of the perching birds (see passeriform): it reaches a length of up to 66 cm (26 inches) and has a wingspan of more than 1.3 metres (4 feet). (Some magpies and the lyrebird exceed the raven in length, but their bodies are smaller.) In the white-necked raven (C. cryptoleucus) of western North America, the bases of the neck feathers are white. Other species of ravens—some with white or brown markings—occur in Africa, southern Asia, Australia, and North America.
