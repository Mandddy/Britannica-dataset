Trevor Brazile,  (born November 16, 1976, Amarillo, Texas, U.S.) American rodeo cowboy who dominated the sport in the early 21st century. He set records in lifetime earnings, single-season earnings, and greatest winnings at a single rodeo and became the third cowboy to win more than one triple crown.
Brazile’s father, Jimmy, had been a professional rodeo cowboy, and his mother, Glenda, had also competed in rodeos. Under their tutelage, Brazile began riding and roping at an early age. He earned an associate’s degree in arts and sciences from Vernon (Texas) Regional Junior College, which he attended on a rodeo scholarship. He then attended West Texas A&amp;M University in Canyon, but he left before graduation to join the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association in 1996. He first qualified for the NFR—the rodeo season’s final event, in which only the best cowboys compete—in 1998 in team roping, which involves two participants: the header, who ropes the steer’s head, and the heeler, who ropes the legs.
