Andrea Doria, Italian passenger liner that sank on July 25–26, 1956, after colliding with the Stockholm off the coast of Nantucket in the Atlantic Ocean. The maritime disaster resulted in the deaths of 51 people—46 from the Andrea Doria and 5 from the Stockholm.
The SS Andrea Doria was a flagship of the Italian Line. Measuring some 697 feet (212 metres) in length, it could carry approximately 1,240 passengers and 560 crew members. The liner was noted for its luxuries, which included three outdoor swimming pools and numerous works of art. In addition, the ship was equipped with notable safety features, such as 11 watertight compartments as well as radar, which was then a relatively new technology. On January 14, 1953, the Andrea Doria set sail on its maiden voyage, traveling from Genoa, Italy, to New York City. The liner proved highly popular and subsequently made numerous other Atlantic crossings.
