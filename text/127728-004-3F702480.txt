Monkey puzzle tree (Araucaria araucana), also called Chile pine,  an evergreen ornamental and timber conifer of the family Araucariaceae, native to the Andes Mountains of South America. The monkey puzzle tree may grow to a height of 45–50 metres (150–164 feet) with a diameter of 2.5 metres (8 feet) and may live for more than 700 years. Its spiral arrangement of rigid needle-pointed leaves along stiff branches inspired its common name, evoked by a comment about the challenge this prickly network might pose to climbing monkeys. Although the tree was declared a natural monument in Chile in 1976 to afford it protection from logging, the species is considered vulnerable in its native habitat because of illegal felling activity and habitat fragmentation.
