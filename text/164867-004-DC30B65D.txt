George Lamming, in full George William Lamming   (born June 8, 1927, Carrington Village, near Bridgetown, Barbados) West Indian novelist and essayist who wrote about decolonization and reconstruction in the Caribbean nations.
At Combermere High School, Lamming studied under Frank Collymore, editor of the Caribbean literary journal Bim, which published some of Lamming’s early work. Lamming left Barbados and worked as a teacher in Trinidad from 1946 to 1950 before settling in England. His highly acclaimed first novel, In the Castle of My Skin (1953), is an autobiographical bildungsroman set against the backdrop of burgeoning nationalism in the British colonies of the Caribbean in the 1930s and ’40s.
