William Cameron Menzies,  (born July 29, 1896, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.—died March 5, 1957, Beverly Hills, California) American set designer, one of the most influential in filmmaking, whose work on The Dove (1927) and The Tempest (1928) won the first Academy Award for art direction. His visual style was also evident in the 15 films he directed, Invaders from Mars (1953) being the best-known.
Menzies studied at Yale University and New York City’s Art Students League. After military service in World War I, he began his Hollywood career as a production designer on The Naulahka in 1918. The following year he served (uncredited) as the art director on The Witness for the Defense and soon became sought-after. Menzies’s reputation derives from the opulent fairy-tale settings of such films as The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and The Beloved Rogue (1927). He often used forced perspective, making actual depths appear much greater than they were. Another of his techniques was to use broken diagonal barriers—fences, walls, or railings—to emphasize tension, grief, or separation.
