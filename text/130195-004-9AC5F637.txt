Cardiomyopathy, any cardiac disease process that results in heart failure due to a decrease in the pumping power of the heart or due to an impairment in the filling of the cardiac chambers. Persons with cardiomyopathy frequently retain excess fluid, resulting in congestion of the lungs, and have symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Sometimes they develop a potentially fatal arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm.
Most cardiomyopathies are idiopathic, or of unknown cause. Specific cases are usually categorized as dilated, hypertrophic, or restrictive, according to the observed abnormality. Dilated cardiomyopathy, the most common type of the disease, is characterized by an enlarged heart with stretching of the ventricle (lower chamber) and atrium (upper chamber). The left ventricle, which pumps oxygenated blood to the body tissues, shows weakness in contraction (systolic dysfunction) and stiffness in expansion and filling (diastolic dysfunction). These dysfunctions lead to fluid retention and eventually heart failure. Preceding heart attack is known to cause the condition, as is exposure to toxic substances such as alcohol, cobalt, and some anticancer drugs.
