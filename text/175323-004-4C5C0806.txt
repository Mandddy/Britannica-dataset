Bambi, American animated film, released in 1942, that is considered a classic in the Disney canon for its lush hand-drawn animation and its sensitive affective narrative.
The story chronicles the adventures of Bambi, a fawn whose father is revered as the Great Prince of the Forest. From birth Bambi is guided through life by his mother and a diverse group of woodland friends, including a rabbit named Thumper. While playing in a meadow one day, Bambi meets a female fawn, Faline. Months later Bambi’s beloved mother is killed by a hunter, forcing Bambi to grow up on his own while his father roams the forest. He playfully flirts with Faline and emerges victorious in a battle with another adolescent buck, but danger looms when hunters return. After saving Faline from a pack of hunting dogs, Bambi is wounded by gunshot. Meanwhile, a nearby campfire begins to spread. However, the two deer manage to escape to safety, and Bambi later assumes his father’s role as the Great Prince of the Forest.
