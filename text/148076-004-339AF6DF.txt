The chicken turtle has an exceptionally long neck and a finely grooved upper shell covered with an open network of yellowish lines on a brownish background.

The chicken turtle inhabits quiet bodies of water and probably feeds on both animal and vegetable material. It frequently leaves the water and travels about on land.
