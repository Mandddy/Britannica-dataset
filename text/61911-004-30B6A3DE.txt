Alla Nazimova, pseudonym of Alla Leventon   (born June 4, 1879, Yalta, Crimea, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died July 13, 1945, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) Russian-born and Russian-trained actress who won fame on the American stage and screen.
At age 17 Alla Leventon abandoned her training as a violinist and went to Moscow to work in theatre with V.I. Nemirovich-Danchenko and Konstantin Stanislavsky. She graduated into the Moscow Art Theatre but left to tour in the provinces and then work with the Paul Orleneff Company in St. Petersburg. She then visited the United States (1905), where, although she spoke not a word of English, she so impressed the Shubert brothers that they hired her on the condition she learn English in six months. She did, and she opened in Hedda Gabler on November 13, 1906. She adopted the name Nazimova about this time. During the next two years Nazimova was acclaimed for her portrayals of other Henrik Ibsen characters: Nora in A Doll’s House, Hedwig in The Wild Duck, and Hilda in The Master Builder. She was so successful that the Shuberts built a theatre especially for her; on April 18, 1910, she opened the Nazimova Theatre, playing Rita Allmers in Ibsen’s Little Eyolf.
