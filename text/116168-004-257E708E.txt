River Tay, longest river in Scotland, flowing about 120 miles (193 km) from its source on the north slopes of Ben Lui to the North Sea below Dundee. The river drains 2,400 square miles (6,216 square km), the largest drainage area in Scotland. Before reaching the stretch of Loch Tay (15 miles [24 km] long) at Killin, the headwaters flow under the names Fillan and Dochart. On leaving Loch Tay at Kenmore, the river receives the tributaries Lyon, Earn, and the outfall from the Tummel-Garry Hydroelectric Scheme, which helps control flooding of the river.
