Sir Charles James Napier,  (born August 10, 1782, London, England—died August 29, 1853, Portsmouth, Hampshire) British general, who conquered (1843) Sind (now in Pakistan) and served as its governor (1843–47).
Napier, a relative of the statesman Charles James Fox, was a veteran of the (Iberian) Peninsular War against Napoleonic France and of the War of 1812 against the United States. From 1822 to 1830 he was a military resident of Cephalonia, in the Ionian Islands. In 1839, when the Chartist agitation for political and social reform threatened to lead to violence, Napier was given command in northern England, where, by tempering his sympathy for the industrial workers with insistence on law and order, he kept a dangerous situation under control for two years.
