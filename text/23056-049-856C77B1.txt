Arlington National Cemetery, U.S. national burial ground in Arlington county, Virginia, on the Potomac River directly opposite Washington, D.C. Located on the antebellum plantation of George Washington Parke Custis, the adopted son of George Washington, the first president of the United States, the cemetery currently occupies 612 acres (248 hectares). Its central feature is Arlington House, a mansion that was constructed in 1802 in a Classical Revival style and modeled after the Theseum in Athens, Greece. The house, which is situated along the prominent ridges overlooking Washington, is operated by the National Park Service and serves as a memorial to Robert E. Lee.
In 1831 Lee married Custis’s only daughter, Mary Ann Randolph, who inherited the Arlington estate upon her father’s death in 1857. On April 22, 1861, at the onset of the American Civil War, Lee left Arlington to join the army of the Confederacy. The area was quickly occupied by federal troops, who converted the Lee mansion into an army headquarters and used its stables for cavalry units operating in northern Virginia. Two forts (McPherson and Whipple) were hastily constructed on the grounds as part of a defensive perimeter around the nation’s capital. In 1862 the government enacted legislation to collect property taxes (which property owners were required to pay in person) on lands held by the Confederacy. Although Lee’s wife paid the $92.07 tax, the government seized the property because Lee failed to deliver the tax himself. Freedman’s Village, a community for more than 1,000 freed slaves, was constructed on part of the property in 1863 and continued to operate until 1890, when the land was rededicated as a military installation. More than 3,800 former slaves are buried in the cemetery.
