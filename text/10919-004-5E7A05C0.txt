Louis Horst,  (born Jan. 12, 1884, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.—died  Jan. 23, 1964, New York City) U.S. pianist, composer, and one of the first persons anywhere to teach choreography as a distinct discipline; known particularly for his long associations as musical director with Denishawn and Martha Graham.
After studying piano and violin in San Francisco, he became musical director for the Denishawn Dancers (1915–25), where he encouraged company members—including Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Charles Weidman—to develop their own dance styles. He accompanied Graham’s solo debut in New York City in 1926 and remained with her as musical director until 1948, composing the scores for her early works Primitive Mysteries (1931), Frontier (1935), and El Penitente (1940).
