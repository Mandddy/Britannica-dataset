Malaysian-Australian monsoon,  the monsoon system affecting Southeast Asia and Australia. It is characterized by winds that blow from the southeast during cooler months and from the northwest during the warmer months of the year.
Southeast Asia and northern Australia are combined in one monsoonal system that differs from others because of the peculiar and somewhat symmetrical distribution of landmasses on both sides of the Equator. In this respect, the northwest monsoon of Australia is unique. The substantial masses of water between Asia and Australia have a moderating effect on tropospheric temperatures, weakening the summer monsoon. The many islands (e.g., Philippines and Indonesia) provide an infinite variety of topographic effects. Typhoons that develop within the monsoonal air bring additional complications.
