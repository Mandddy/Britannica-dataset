David M. Key,  (born Jan. 27, 1824, Greene Co., Tenn., U.S.—died  Feb. 3, 1900, Chattanooga, Tenn.) lawyer and Confederate Army officer who was appointed U.S. postmaster general by Pres. Rutherford B. Hayes in fulfillment of a campaign pledge made by Hayes during the disputed election of 1876.
Admitted to the bar in 1850, Key practiced law in Chattanooga and became active in Democratic politics. In 1856 he stood as a presidential elector for James Buchanan and four years later for John C. Breckinridge. An opponent of secession, he worked to keep Tennessee in the Union but remained loyal to his state once it joined the Confederacy. In 1861 he was commissioned an officer in the Confederate Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel by war’s end. At Vicksburg (1862) he was wounded and taken prisoner.
