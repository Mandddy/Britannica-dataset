Georges Duhamel,  (born June 30, 1884, Paris, France—died April 13, 1966, Valmondois, near Paris) French author most noted for two novel cycles: Vie et aventures de Salavin, 5 vol. (1920–32), and Chronique des Pasquier, 10 vol. (1933–44).
Duhamel took a science degree in 1908 and qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1909. He began by writing poetry, plays, and literary criticism, and in 1906 he joined with several other writers and artists in founding a short-lived community known as the Abbaye de Créteil. Duhamel served as a frontline surgeon during World War I. Deeply moved by the sufferings of war and oppressed by its futility, he recorded his experiences treating the wounded in two short-story collections, Vie des martyrs (1917; The New Book of Martyrs) and Civilisation 1914–1917 (1918); the latter book was awarded the Goncourt Prize.
