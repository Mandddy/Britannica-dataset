Rimini, Latin Ariminum,  town, Emilia-Romagna regione, northern Italy. The town is located along the Riviera del Sole of the Adriatic Sea at the mouth of the Marecchia River, just northeast of Mount Titano and the Republic of San Marino.
The Romans called it Ariminum, from Ariminus, the old name of the Marecchia, and, according to the 1st-century-bc Greek historian Strabo, it originally belonged to the Umbro-Etruscan civilization. The site was occupied in 268 bc by the Romans, and a Latin colony was established there on the boundary of Aemilia and Umbria. As the junction of the great Roman roads the Via Aemilia and the Via Flaminia, it became a Roman municipium (community) and was later sacked by the dictator Sulla. In ad 359 the town was host to the Council of Rimini, which failed to resolve the Arian controversy over the divinity of Christ. Rimini passed to the Byzantines and from them to the Goths, from whom it was recaptured by the Byzantine general Narses, and then to the Lombards and Franks.
