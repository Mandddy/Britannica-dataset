Richard Gere, in full Richard Tiffany Gere  (born August 31, 1949, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American actor and humanitarian, perhaps best known for his portrayal of genteel characters in romantic films.
Gere spent his childhood in upstate New York. In 1967 he enrolled at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship but left college after two years to work as a musician. He performed in numerous bands and began acting in summer programs throughout New England. After performing with the Provincetown Players on Cape Cod and with the Seattle Repertory Theatre, he was cast as an understudy in the rock musical Grease in 1972. The following year Gere performed the leading role in a London production of the play. He had a small role in his first film, Report to the Commissioner (1975), but he gained recognition for his performance alongside Diane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), a dark character study of a troubled young woman. Gere became known as a sex symbol for his roles in such films as Days of Heaven (1978), about a young couple and their relationship with a farmer in Texas, and American Gigolo (1980), in which he played an escort for older women.
