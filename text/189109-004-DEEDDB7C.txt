Parthenogenesis, a reproductive strategy that involves development of a female (rarely a male) gamete (sex cell) without fertilization. It occurs commonly among lower plants and invertebrate animals (particularly rotifers, aphids, ants, wasps, and bees) and rarely among higher vertebrates. An egg produced parthenogenetically may be either haploid (i.e., with one set of dissimilar chromosomes) or diploid (i.e., with a paired set of chromosomes). Parthenogenic species may be obligate (that is, incapable of sexual reproduction) or facultative (that is, capable of switching between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction depending upon environmental conditions). The term parthenogenesis is taken from the Greek words parthos, meaning “virgin,” and genesis, meaning “origin.” More than 2,000 species are thought to reproduce parthenogenically.
Parthenogenesis is sometimes considered to be an asexual form of reproduction; however, it may be more accurately described as an “incomplete form of sexual reproduction,” since offspring of parthenogenic species develop from gametes. Gametes are reproductive cells that result from meiosis (or reduction division)—in which a specialized cell with a (diploid) double set of chromosomes undergoes two fissions of its nucleus. Meiosis gives rise to four gametes, or sex cells, which are haploid—in that each possesses half the number of chromosomes of the original cell (see meiosis).
