Yerkes Observatory, astronomical observatory located at Williams Bay on Lake Geneva in southeastern Wisconsin, U.S. The Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago was named for its benefactor, transportation magnate Charles T. Yerkes, and was opened in 1897. It contains the largest refracting telescope (40 inches [1 metre]) in the world. The refractor has been used for solar and stellar spectroscopy, photographic parallaxes, and double-star observations, while other more modern telescopes at the site have been equipped for photoelectric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic applications.
Yerkes Observatory epitomized American astronomer George Ellery Haleâ€™s passion for building observatories with laboratories to link physics to the stars. When Hale left Yerkes in 1904 to establish Mount Wilson Observatory, his second in command and successor, stellar spectroscopist Edwin B. Frost, managed to keep the observatory open. Frost initiated formal graduate training at Yerkes, awarding the first Ph.D. in 1912.
