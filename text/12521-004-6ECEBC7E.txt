Cuphea,  genus of more than 200 species of chiefly tropical American herbs or shrubs of the family Lythraceae. Four species—native to Mexico and Central America—are commonly grown indoors for their attractive flowers.
Cuphea hyssopifolia, elfin herb, is a small hairy shrub with many branches. The small stalkless leaves are crowded and narrow; the flowers are tubular and violet white. C. llavea grows to a height of 60 centimetres (2 feet), is covered with stiff hairs, and has nearly stalkless, oval, rough leaves. The tubular flowers are red. C. micropetala grows 30–120 cm tall, with oblong leaves; its tubular yellow flowers are scarlet near the base. C. platycentra (sometimes C. ignea), commonly called the cigar flower, grows 20–37 cm tall and has lance-shaped leaves. The tubular flowers are reddish, with a dark ring near the tip and an ashy-white mouth.
