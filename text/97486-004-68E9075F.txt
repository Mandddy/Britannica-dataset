Chicomecóatl, (
        Nahuatl: “Seven Snakes”) also called Xilonen (“Young Maize-Ear Doll”),   Aztec goddess of sustenance and, hence, of corn (maize), one of the most ancient and important goddesses in the Valley of Mexico. The number seven in her name is associated with luck and generative power. She was often portrayed as the consort of the corn god, Centéotl. Chicomecóatl is depicted in Aztec documents with her body and face painted red, wearing a distinctive rectangular headdress or pleated fan of red paper. She is similarly represented in sculpture, often holding a double ear of corn in each hand.
