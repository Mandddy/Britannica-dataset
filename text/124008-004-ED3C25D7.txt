Tidal power, any form of renewable energy in which tidal action in the oceans is converted to electric power.
There are a number of ways in which tidal power can be harnessed. Tidal barrage power systems take advantage of differences between high tides and low tides by using a “barrage,” or type of dam, to block receding water during ebb periods. At low tide, water behind the barrage is released, and the water passes through a turbine that generates electricity. Tidal stream power systems take advantage of ocean currents to drive turbines, particularly in areas around islands or coasts where these currents are fast. They can be installed as tidal fences—where turbines are stretched across a channel—or as tidal turbines, which resemble underwater wind turbines (see wind power). Wave power systems use the up-and-down motion of waves to drive energy production and can be installed in shoreline areas as well as offshore. Generally, the areas of greatest potential for wave energy development are the latitudes with the highest winds (latitudes 40°–60° N and S) on the eastern shores of the world’s oceans. For this reason, a large potential for wave power systems exists in the British Isles and the Pacific Northwest of the United States.
