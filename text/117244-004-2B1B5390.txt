Battle of Sedan, (Sept. 1, 1870), decisive defeat of the French army in the Franco-German War, which led to the fall of the Second French Empire; it was fought at the French border fortress of Sedan on the Meuse River, between 120,000 French troops under Marshal Mac-Mahon and more than 200,000 German troops under General Helmuth von Moltke.
Mac-Mahon had intended to march his army, accompanied by Napoleon III, from Châlons-sur-Marne northeast toward Metz, to relieve the French Army of the Rhine, which was trapped at Metz. Moltke learned of Mac-Mahon’s movements through newspaper reports and rapidly moved the newly formed Army of the Meuse, under Crown Prince Albert of Saxony, north to intercept Mac-Mahon. In three small engagements on the Meuse River (August 29 to 31), the Germans forced Mac-Mahon to fall back to the fortress at Sedan. While Mac-Mahon tried to consider whether to try again to smash through eastward toward Metz or instead to retreat west to Paris, Moltke moved up the 3rd Prussian Army, under Crown Prince Frederick William, to complete the encirclement of Sedan.
