Vas, megye (county), western Hungary. It borders the counties of Györ-Moson-Sopron to the north, Veszprém to the east, and Zala to the south, along with the countries of Slovenia to the southwest and Austria to the west. Its name derives from the town of Vasvár, which lies on the bank of the Dráva River. Szombathely is the county seat.
Other major towns include Koszeg, Sárvár, Celldömölk, Körmend, Szentgotthárd, Vasvár, Csepreg, and Répcelak. As a result of the separation of areas inhabited by ethnic Germans and Slovenes, Vas’s population comprises mostly Hungarians. Smaller ethnic minorities include Roma (Gypsies), Vends (Slovenes who settled here in the 6th century), Croatians, and Germans.
