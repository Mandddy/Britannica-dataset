Johnny Dodds,  (born April 12, 1892, New Orleans, La., U.S.—died  Aug. 8, 1940, Chicago, Ill.) African-American musician noted as one of the most lyrically expressive of jazz clarinetists.
Dodds grew up in the musically stimulating environment of New Orleans in the early years of jazz and began playing clarinet at age 17. He played in Fate Marable’s riverboat bands (1917) before becoming an integral part of King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band (1920–24), one of the most closely unified of all jazz ensembles. He provided counterpoint to the melodic leads of cornetists Oliver and Louis Armstrong.
