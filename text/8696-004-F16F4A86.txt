Yucca moth,  (genus Tegeticula), any of four species of insects of the Prodoxidae family of moths (order Lepidoptera). The adults are small, diurnal, and have tiny spines covering their wings.
Each of the four species is adapted to a particular species of yucca. The moths emerge when the yucca flowers open. The female gathers pollen from one flower, rolls it into a ball, flies to another flower, lays four or five eggs, and inserts the pollen mass in the opening thus formed. The larvae eat about half the approximately 200 seeds produced by the plant. The yucca can be fertilized by no other insect, and the moth can utilize no other plant. Larvae of the related bogus yucca moth (Prodoxus) feed in the stems and seed capsules of the yucca plant and also attack the century plant.
