Avrom Goldfaden, Avrom also spelled Abraham, original name Avrom Goldenfoden, Yiddish Avrom Goldfadn  (born July 24 [July 12, Old Style], 1840, Starokonstantinov, Russia—died January 9, 1908, New York, New York, U.S.) Hebrew and Yiddish poet and playwright and originator of Yiddish theatre and opera.
Goldfaden published volumes of Hebrew and Yiddish poems before his graduation from a rabbinical seminary at Zhitomir in 1866. He then taught in Russia until migrating in 1875 to Poland, where he founded two Yiddish newspapers. After several failures in journalism he moved to Romania; at Iaşi, in 1876, he organized what is generally recognized as the first Yiddish theatre. He toured Romania and Russia, and, in 1883, when Yiddish plays were prohibited in Russia, he established his theatre in Warsaw. In 1887 Goldfaden migrated to New York City, establishing the first illustrated Yiddish periodical, but his work in the Yiddish theatre encountered strong opposition, and he returned to London two years later. He reorganized the Yiddish theatre that had been founded there the previous year but again encountered hostility from the actors. In 1903 he finally settled in New York and opened a dramatic school. Since many of his dramatic works are set to his own music, Goldfaden is also considered to be the founder of Yiddish opera. Among his nearly 400 plays are David at War (the first Hebrew play produced in the United States; first performed, 1904), Shulamit (considered his masterwork, 1880), and Bar Kochba (1882).
