University of Leipzig, German Universit√§t Leipzig,  coeducational state-controlled institution of higher education in Leipzig, Germany. It was renamed Karl Marx University of Leipzig in 1953 by the communist leadership of East Germany, but the original name was restored in 1990. The University of Leipzig was founded in 1409 by German students and professors who withdrew from the University of Prague when Wenceslas IV, king of Bohemia, turned that four-nation university over to the Czechs. The University of Leipzig was confirmed by papal bull in 1409. In 1539 Leipzig accepted the Reformation, which thoroughly penetrated the university. In the 18th and 19th centuries the university became one of the leading literary and cultural centres of Europe because of its eminent scholars and professors. The literary theorist Johann Gottsched was perhaps its most-famous professor, and the mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, the literary figure Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the philosopher Johann Fichte, and the composer Richard Wagner were students there.
