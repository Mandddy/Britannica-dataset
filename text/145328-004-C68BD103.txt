National Portrait Gallery, museum in London that houses the national collection of portraits of British men and women. It is located adjacent to the National Gallery, north of Trafalgar Square, in Westminster.
The gallery was founded by an act of Parliament in 1856 and was housed at a number of locations until its present home, an Italian Renaissance-style building designed by Ewan Christian, opened in 1895/96. The building was extended in 1933. The gallery also maintains displays from its extensive collection at Montacute House, Somerset; Beningborough Hall, Shipton, Yorkshire; Gawthorpe Hall, Padiham, Lancashire; and Bodelwyddan Castle, Denbighshire, Wales.
