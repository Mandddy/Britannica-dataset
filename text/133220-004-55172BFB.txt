Yukonâ€“Charley Rivers National Preserve, protected river-basin region in east-central Alaska, U.S. Proclaimed a national monument in 1978, the area underwent boundary and name changes in 1980, when it became a national preserve. The total area of the preserve is 3,948 square miles (10,225 square km). Headquarters are in Eagle, on the Yukon River.
The preserve extends westward from the border with Yukon territory, northwestern Canada, to encompass some 130 miles (210 km) of the Yukon River and adjoining lands and the entire drainage basin of the 108-mile (174-km) Charley River, which flows into the Yukon from the south. The area contains numerous cabins and other relics of the 1890s Klondike gold rush as well as paleontological and archaeological sites. Plant life consists mainly of tundra vegetation, with willows and some conifers and other trees found along rivers and streams. Wildlife includes peregrine falcons and other raptorial birds, caribou, moose, Dall sheep, brown (grizzly) bears, and wolves.
