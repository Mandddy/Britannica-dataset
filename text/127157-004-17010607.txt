Ii Naosuke,  (born Nov. 29, 1815, Hikone, Japan—died  March 24, 1860, Edo [now Tokyo]) Japanese feudal lord and statesman who was responsible for Japan’s signing the first treaty of commerce with the United States (1858), opening the country to Western influence, and for the last attempt at reasserting the traditional political role of the Tokugawa (the dynasty of Japan’s military rulers) before its fall in 1867.
The Ii family, from which he was descended, ruled the fief of Hikone and played an important part in the administration of the shoguns—i.e., the military dictators who had in effect ruled Japan since the 12th century. The family owed its prominent position to its standing among the fudai daimyo, the barons who had helped the Tokugawa become shoguns in the early 17th century. When Ii Naosuke was born, the 14th son of Ii Naonaka, his father had already turned over power to his eldest son. After the father’s death, all sons except the heir had by family custom to be adopted into other baronial families or else be reduced to the status of family retainer with a small stipend. The only son for whom an adoptive family could not be found, Ii devoted himself to his studies at an academy established by his family. As a samurai, a member of the warrior class, he was schooled in the arts of warfare, as well as in Japan’s cultural traditions, and he developed into a strong-willed and independent individual.
