Opuntia, largest genus of the family Cactaceae, native to the New World, with some 200 species. It has characteristic glochidia—small bristles with backward-facing barbs in the areoles. (These barbs are difficult to remove from human skin.) The genus is divided into subgroups based on the form of the stem segments. Some Opuntia have cylindrical joints, called cholla; the remaining Opuntia are prickly pear, composed of flat joints, stem segments arising one from the end of another. Some botanists advocate dividing the two subgroups into separate genera.
Opuntia occurs from the Peace River in western Canada almost to the tip of South America. In the Northern Hemisphere it is the most northern-ranging cactus. The most cold-hardy forms are small, some with joints only 2.5–5 cm (1–2 inches) long. In contrast, O. ficus-indica (or O. megacantha), the commonly cultivated prickly pear of Mexico, is treelike, reaching 5 metres (16 feet), with a woody trunk and joints 30–50 cm (12–20 inches) long or more.
