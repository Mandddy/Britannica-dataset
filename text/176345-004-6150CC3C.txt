The Night of the Hunter, American crime thriller, released in 1955, that is regarded as a masterpiece of tone and suspense. Its screenplay was cowritten by Charles Laughton and James Agee, and it was the only directorial effort by Laughton.
Surrealistic in style, the story concerns two young children trying to flee their murderous stepfather, a crazed self-appointed preacher, conman, and former prisoner played by Robert Mitchum in one of the finest performances of his career. His character, one of film’s great villains, marries the children’s mother (played by Shelley Winters) in the belief that she or her children know the whereabouts of a large stash of money, and he stops at nothing in his attempts to pry this knowledge out of them. Famously, the violent preacher has the word Love tattooed on the knuckles of one hand, and Hate tattooed on the other.
