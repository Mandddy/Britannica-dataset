Kathleen Battle, in full Kathleen Deanne Battle   (born Aug. 13, 1948, Portsmouth, Ohio, U.S.)  American opera singer, among the finest coloratura sopranos of her time.
As a child and young adult Battle was both a good student and a good singer. She was awarded a scholarship to the University of Cincinnati College–Conservatory of Music in Ohio, where she earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music education. While teaching, she continued to study voice privately; when Thomas Schippers (then conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra) heard her sing, he hired her to perform at the 1972 Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
