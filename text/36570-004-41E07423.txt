Émile de Girardin,  (born June 21, 1806, Paris—died  April 27, 1881, Paris) popular French journalist, called the Napoleon of the press for his success in publishing inexpensive newspapers with massive circulations.
The illegitimate son of Count Alexandre de Girardin by the wife of a Parisian lawyer, he took his father’s name upon the publication of his first work, an autobiographical novel Émile (1827). In 1828 he founded his first periodical, Le Voleur, a monthly review of arts and science, and soon became an important figure in Parisian society, marrying, in 1831, the writer Delphine Gay. His reputation was enlarged by numerous other publishing successes—including an atlas, an almanac, and several journals—and he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1834.
