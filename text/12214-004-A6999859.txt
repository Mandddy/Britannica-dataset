Maxime Du Camp,  (born Feb. 8, 1822, Paris, Fr.—died  Feb. 9, 1894, Baden-Baden, Ger.) French writer and photographer who is chiefly known for his vivid accounts of 19th-century French life. He was a close friend of the novelist Gustave Flaubert.
An outgoing, adventurous man, Du Camp also pioneered in photography and published works in virtually every literary genre. He traveled widely with Flaubert (1844–45 and 1849–51), and his Égypte, Nubie, Palestine et Syrie (1852), written after one of their journeys, is among the first books illustrated with photographs. During the revolutionary year 1848 he was wounded and then decorated for counterrevolutionary activity in France. His Expédition des deux-Siciles (1861; “Expedition to the Two Sicilies”) recounted his experiences as a volunteer with the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi.
