Watch fob, short ribbon or chain attached to a watch and hanging out of the pocket in which the watch is kept; the term can also refer to ornaments hung at the end of such a ribbon or chain. Until World War I and the development of the wristwatch, most watches designed for men had to be carried in the pocket. About 1772 the fashion of carrying a watch in each waistcoat fob pocket was introduced (though one watch was usually false); watch fobs consisted of chains supporting seals. By the beginning of the 19th century, the fashion for elaborate masculine jewelry had passed, and all that remained of the watch fob was usually a simple chain.
