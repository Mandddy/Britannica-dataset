Ignacio Aldecoa,  (born July 11, 1925, Vitoria, Spain—died  Nov. 15, 1969, Madrid) Spanish novelist whose work is noted for its local colour and careful composition.
Aldecoa studied at the University of Madrid, became a newspaper writer, and from 1947 to 1956 was a broadcaster for the radio station Voice of the Falange. He published essays on politics, several collections of short stories, and two books of poems, Todavía la vida (1947; “Life Goes On”) and Libro de las algas (1949; “Book of Algae”), before his first novels, El fulgor y la sangre (1954; “The Brightness and the Blood”) and Con el viento solano (1956; “With the East Wind”). Aldecoa wrote about ordinary workers, their hopes, their fears, and the tendency of their lives toward monotony. He was adept at using the technical terms of different trades for artistic effect, including those of sailing in Gran Sol (1957; “Great Sun”) and fishing in Parte de una historia (1967; “Part of a Story”).
