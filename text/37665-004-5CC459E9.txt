Mariano Moreno,  (born Sept. 3, 1778, Buenos Aires, viceroyalty of the Rió de la Plata [now in Argentina]—died  1811, at sea) patriot who was the intellectual and political leader of Argentina’s movement for independence.
After practicing law in Buenos Aires and holding several posts in the Spanish colonial bureaucracy, Moreno came to public attention in September 1809 with his tract Representación de los hacendados (“Landowners’ Petition”). His argument attacking the restrictive Spanish Navigation Acts and urging that Argentines be free to trade with other nations induced concessions by the viceroy two months later.
