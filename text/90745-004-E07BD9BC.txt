Betty Grable, byname of Ruth Elizabeth Grable  (born December 18, 1916, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.—died July 2, 1973, Santa Monica, Calif.) American film actress and dancer who was one of the leading box office draws of the 1940s. She starred primarily in musicals with formulaic plots that embraced her wholesome, good-natured screen image and featured athletic dance numbers which showed off her shapely legs.
Grable was set on the road to stardom by her mother, who enrolled her from an early age in dance and music classes and in 1929 moved with her to Hollywood. Only 13 years old, Grable lied about her age and landed chorus girl parts in several Hollywood musicals. She sang and danced in films throughout the 1930s (sometimes using the name Frances Dean) but did not make much of an impression until 1939, when she was a hit on Broadway in Cole Porter’s musical Du Barry Was a Lady. She was then called back to Hollywood by Twentieth Century Fox, and in 1940 she had her first blockbuster success with Down Argentine Way. That film was followed by such hits as Moon over Miami (1941), Sweet Rosie O’Grady (1943), Pin Up Girl (1944), and The Dolly Sisters (1946)—the success of which helped pull Fox out of debt.
