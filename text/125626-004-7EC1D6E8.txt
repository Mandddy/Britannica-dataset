White River,  river rising in the Boston Mountains, in northwestern Arkansas, U.S., and flowing northeast into southern Missouri, where it bends southeast and reenters Arkansas, continuing in a southerly direction to join the Arkansas River near its confluence with the Mississippi River, above Arkansas City. The river’s descent in the upper course exceeds 25 feet (8 m) per mile. Through the Boston Mountains and the Ozark Plateau of southern Missouri, the White River is deeply entrenched in narrow gorges; much of its middle course is a valley more than 500 feet (150 m) deep. At Newport, Ark., the White emerges from the highlands onto the Mississippi River’s floodplain, where the stream gradient is less than 3 feet (9 m) per mile, with many meanders, abandoned channels, and swampland. The river is 685 miles (1,102 km) long, drains 28,000 square miles (73,000 square km), and is navigable upstream to Batesville, Ark., for about 300 miles (480 km).
Major tributaries are the Buffalo River entering from the south and the Cache, Little Red, and North Fork rivers entering from the north. Bull Shoals Dam (1947), on the White River just north of Cotter, Ark., impounds Bull Shoals Lake, which extends 37 miles (60 km) upstream. Forsyth Dam impounds Lake Taneycomo, 5 miles (8 km) northeast of Branson, Mo.
