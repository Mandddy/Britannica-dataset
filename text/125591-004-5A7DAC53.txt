Hovenweep National Monument, several scattered archaeological sites in southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah, U.S., 25 miles (40 km) west of Cortez, Colorado. The monument, established in 1923, has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3 square km).
Hovenweep consists of six groups of pre-Columbian Indian ruins built of coursed-stone masonry: the Square Tower Canyon Cluster and the Cajon Canyon Group in Utah; and the Holly (or Keeley) Canyon Group, the Hackberry Canyon Group, Cutthroat Castle, and Goodman Point in Colorado. Their square, oval, and D-shaped towers are excellent examples of Pueblo Indian defensive architecture of the period ad 1100–1300. Some of the towers may have served as storage bins; others, on the edges of cliffs, apparently were used as lookout points; still others were built over kivas (underground ceremonial chambers). Hovenweep is a Ute Indian word meaning “deserted valley.” Access to the monument is by graded dirt and gravel roads.
