Frost, atmospheric moisture directly crystallized on the ground and on exposed objects. The term also refers to the occurrence of subfreezing temperatures that affect plants and crops.
Frost crystals, often called hoarfrost in the aggregate, form when the invisible water vapour of the atmosphere passes into the ice crystal phase without going through the intermediate liquid phase. Hoarfrost lightly covers fields and rooftops under conditions that would form dew if the temperature were above freezing at the point of formation. Sometimes the freezing temperature will be reached after dew has already formed, producing frozen dew, but this usually cannot be readily distinguished, because crystals ordinarily will start forming at about the same time the freezing starts.
