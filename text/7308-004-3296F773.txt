Chang’e, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’ang O,  the Chinese moon goddess whose loveliness is celebrated in poems and novels. She sought refuge in the moon when her consort, Hou Yi (the Lord Archer), discovered she had stolen the drug of immortality given to him by the gods. Hou Yi’s pursuit was impeded by the Hare, who would not let the irate husband pass until he promised reconciliation.
Each year on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month, Chinese people celebrate the memory of Chang’e with a “Mid-Autumn Festival” (Zhongqiu Jie). With a full moon shining in the heavens, “moon cakes” are eaten and offered as gifts to friends and neighbours. Many go outside to view the supposed outline of a toad on the surface of the moon, for this creature, according to one legend, is now Chang’e. At one time she was called Hong’e, but the name became taboo when two Chinese emperors took it as their own.
