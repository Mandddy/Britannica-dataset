Canopus, also called Alpha Carinae,  second brightest star (after Sirius) in the night sky, with a visual magnitude of −0.73. Lying in the southern constellation Carina, 310 light-years from Earth, Canopus is sometimes used as a guide in the attitude control of spacecraft because of its angular distance from the Sun and the contrast of its brightness among nearby celestial objects. The Syrian Stoic philosopher Poseidonius (c. 135–50 bc) used sightings of Canopus near the horizon in his estimation of the size of Earth.
