Lactose, carbohydrate containing one molecule of glucose and one of galactose linked together. Composing about 2 to 8 percent of the milk of all mammals, lactose is sometimes called milk sugar. It is the only common sugar of animal origin. Lactose can be prepared from whey, a by-product of the cheese-making process. Fermentation of lactose by microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus is part of the industrial production of lactic acid. Human lactose intolerance is indicated by diarrhea and abdominal bloating and discomfort; lactose intolerance also may be a cause of diarrhea in newborns.
