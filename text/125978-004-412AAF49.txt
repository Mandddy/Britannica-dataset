Anastasius II,  (born , Rome [Italy]—died  Nov. 19, 498, Rome) pope from Nov. 24, 496, to 498.
In notifying the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I of his accession, Anastasius expressed a conciliatory attitude toward the late patriarch Acacius of Constantinople, who had been deposed and excommunicated in 484 by Pope St. Felix III. The Acacian Schism resulted from this act. The pope’s reception of the Byzantine deacon Photinus, sent to Rome by a supporter of Acacius, was followed by a schism at Rome and the charge that the pope desired to rehabilitate Acacius. Anastasius died in the midst of the controversy, and his actions have led many to consider him a traitor to the western cause.
