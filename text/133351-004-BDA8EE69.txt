Erich Honecker,  (born August 25, 1912, Neunkirchen, Germany—died May 29, 1994, Chile) communist official who, as first secretary of East Germany’s Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, or SED), was East Germany’s leader from 1971 until he fell from power in 1989 in the wake of the democratic reforms sweeping eastern Europe.
The son of a miner who was an official of the Communist Party, Honecker joined the Communist Youth Movement at the age of 14 and in 1929 became a full party member. By trade he was a slater. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, he organized illegal activities by young communists in various parts of Germany. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1935 and sentenced to 10 years’ hard labour for “preparing treason.” He refused to repudiate his communist convictions.
