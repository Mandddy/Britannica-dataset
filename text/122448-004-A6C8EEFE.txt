Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne,  (born Aug. 29, 1769, Grenoble, Fr.—died  Nov. 18, 1852, St. Charles, Mo., U.S.; canonized July 3, 1988; feast day November 17) missionary who founded the first Sacred Heart convents in the United States.
Duchesne was born into a wealthy family with high political and financial connections. In 1780 she went to study at a convent and, despite her father’s opposition, entered the Visitation Order in Grenoble in 1788. When the community was dispersed by the French Revolution (1792), she did charitable works for nine years. After vainly trying to reestablish the Visitandines in their convent of Sainte-Marie-d’en-Haut, she turned the convent over to the newly founded Society of the Sacred Heart in 1804 and was received by its founder, St. Madeleine Sophie Barat.
