Lenny Henry, byname of Sir Lenworth George Henry  (born August 29, 1958, Dudley, West Midlands, England) British comedian, actor, and writer.
As a teenager, Henry performed a comedy act in local nightclubs, which led to a successful appearance on the television talent program New Faces when he was 16 years old. The national exposure he gained from that show helped to secure him a role in The Fosters (1976–77), the first British situation comedy with an all-black cast. He followed this stint with a number of short television appearances that varied from Saturday morning children’s shows (Tiswas) to surreal alternative sitcoms (The Young Ones).
