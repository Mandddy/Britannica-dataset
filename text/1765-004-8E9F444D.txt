Iwakura Tomomi,  (born Oct. 26, 1825, Kyōto, Japan—died  July 20, 1883, Tokyo) one of Japan’s most influential statesmen of the 19th century.
He was born to the family of a court noble of relatively low rank. Adopted as son and heir of the more powerful Iwakura family, he gained an important place in court circles after the U.S. naval officer Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853 succeeded in forcing Japan to allow foreigners to enter the country.
