Earth-crossing asteroid, asteroid whose path around the Sun crosses Earth’s orbit. Two groups of such asteroids—Aten and Apollo asteroids—are distinguished by the size of their orbits and how closely they approach the Sun. The Atens and Apollos cross Earth’s orbit on an almost continuous basis. Astronomers have mounted searches for objects that closely approach Earth, partly to determine whether they may collide with the planet, since early detection might make it possible to avert a catastrophe. It is currently estimated that there are about 1,000 Earth-crossing asteroids larger than 1 km (0.6 mile). Asteroids in inner solar system planet-crossing orbits move back and forth among the various kinds of such orbits before eventually colliding with a planet or being ejected from the solar system. Impacts of 1-km-size asteroids are believed to occur a few times every million years. Such a collision would deliver the explosive force of several hydrogen bombs, possibly resulting in global climate disturbances or huge tidal waves. The impact of an object about 10 km (6 miles) in diameter is thought to have caused a massive extinction of species, including the dinosaurs, at the end of the Cretaceous Period (66 million years ago).
