The Seventh Seal, Swedish Det sjunde inseglet,  Swedish allegorical dramatic film, released in 1957, that is widely considered director Ingmar Bergman’s greatest work and a classic in world cinema.
Antonius Block (played by Max von Sydow) is a disillusioned knight who has returned from the Crusades only to find his homeland of Sweden ravaged by plague. Having witnessed so much cruelty and misery, he is unable to continue believing in God. When the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot) comes for him, the knight suggests a chess match with his life as the prize. Throughout the game Death interrupts the play in order to spread more calamities on the world without ever answering the knight’s almost desperate inquiries about the existence of God. The final scene is one of the most iconic in film history, showing hand-holding figures on a hill in their dance of death.
