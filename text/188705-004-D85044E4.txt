David Schwimmer,  (born November 2, 1966, Queens, New York, U.S.) American actor and director who was perhaps best known for his role on the television sitcom Friends (1994–2004).
Schwimmer was raised by his parents—both prominent attorneys—in Los Angeles. In 1984 he entered the theatre department of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and subsequently found inspiration and success on the Chicago stage. In his junior year he mounted an off-campus production of Alice in Wonderland that eventually led to the launching of the Lookingglass Theater Company, which Schwimmer cofounded with seven other Northwestern alumni following graduation in 1988.
