Take the Money and Run, American screwball comedy film, released in 1969, that was cowritten and directed by Woody Allen and marked his first leading role onscreen.
The film, presented in a “mockumentary” format, recounts the misadventures of would-be master criminal Virgil Starkwell (played by Allen) as he blunders from one petty caper to another. Virgil’s bungled attempts at robbery repeatedly land him in jail. He finds some purpose in his life, however, when, on parole, he falls in love with a woman (Janet Margolin) whose purse he had been planning to steal. In one of the movie’s most popular scenes, Virgil tries to escape prison by using a bar of soap blackened with shoe polish and whittled into the shape of a gun, a ploy that goes awry when it begins to rain.
