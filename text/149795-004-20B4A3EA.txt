Skype, software for communication over the Internet, which includes voice, video, and instant message capabilities. Skype was one of the early successes in using the voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP). Luxembourg-based Skype Technologies, founded by Niklas Zennström of Sweden and Janus Friis of Denmark, first introduced the software client in 2003. The number of registered users of Skype was about 50 million in 2005 and increased more than 10-fold to more than 600 million just five years later.
VoIP communication, intended to eventually replace conventional telephone networks, operates by converting the analog sound of a human voice into digital information and transmitting it over the Internet, to be translated back into analog audio at the receiver’s end. Unlike many VoIP services, Skype uses a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) network, in which all connected computers share processing tasks and bandwidth, allowing its capacity to scale in tandem with its user base. This P2P technology was retained by Joltid, a company founded by Zennström and Friis, and licensed by eBay. Because it operates over existing Internet connections and does not require a dedicated network of cables, Skype can offer most core services—including in-network long-distance calling—for free.
