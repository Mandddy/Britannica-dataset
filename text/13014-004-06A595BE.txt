Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette,  (born May 24, 1763, Nevers, Franceâ€”died April 13, 1794, Paris) French Revolutionary leader, social reformer, and promoter of the anti-Christian cult of the goddess Reason. He was put to death by the Revolutionary tribunal because of his democratic extremism.
Chaumette went to sea as a cabin boy, studied botany, traveled widely in France, and then settled in Paris as a medical student by 1790. As an active Revolutionary he signed the petition (July 17, 1791) that demanded the abdication of Louis XVI. From December 1792 he was procurator-general of the Paris Commune, in which capacity he improved conditions in the hospitals; organized decent burial for the poor; and forbade whipping in the schools, prostitution, obscene publications, and lotteries.
