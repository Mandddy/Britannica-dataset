Sacred Heart,  in the Roman Catholic Church, the physical heart of Jesus as an object of devotion. The use of Jesus’ heart to symbolize his love for men is not found in the Bible but in the writings of some medieval mystics. The devotion was fostered by Carthusian and Jesuit priests and promoted by St. Francis de Sales and became popular following the disclosure of private revelations to a French Visitandine nun, St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, in the late 17th century. Assisted by Claude de la Colombière, she called for the establishment of a feast in honour of the Sacred Heart and for prayers of reparation for sins, especially for those directed against the Eucharist. In 1856 Pope Pius IX introduced the feast into the general calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. In addition to the feast, now celebrated on the Friday of the third week after Pentecost, devotion includes acts of consecration and honour given to the image of the Sacred Heart. Such images are often depicted with a wounded heart, encircled by a crown of thorns and radiating light.
