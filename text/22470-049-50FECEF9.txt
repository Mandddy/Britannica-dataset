Deere &amp; Company, major American manufacturer of farm machinery and industrial equipment. It is headquartered in Moline, Ill.
The company’s origin dates to 1836, when John Deere invented the first steel plow that could till American Midwest prairie soil without clogging. The following year, Deere established a business to manufacture and market the plow, and his own company was incorporated as Deere &amp; Company in 1868. The present firm was incorporated in 1958 as John Deere–Delaware Company; it assumed the current company name later that year after merging with the older Deere &amp; Company and its subsidiaries. Since its inception, Deere &amp; Company has witnessed five generations of Deere family leadership.
