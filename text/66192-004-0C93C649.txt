Robert Bresson,  (born September 25, 1901, Bromont-Lamonthe, Puy-de Dôme, France—died December 18, 1999, Droué-sur-Drouette) French writer-director who, despite his limited output, has been rightly celebrated as one of the cinema’s few authentic geniuses.
Details of Bresson’s early years are sketchy, though it is known that he began painting in high school, where he excelled in languages and philosophy; that he attended Paris’s Lycée Lakanal à Sceaux; and that he was married in 1926. He pursued a painting career until 1933, when he wrote his first screenplay. The following year he directed Affaires publiques, a satiric short subject. Unable to finance a follow-up film, he wrote scripts for other directors, including René Clair. Enlisting in the army at the outbreak of World War II, he was captured by the Germans in 1940 and held prisoner of war for more than a year. When he returned to Paris, the French film industry was in such disarray that he easily found work. In 1943 he directed his first feature, Les Anges du péché.
