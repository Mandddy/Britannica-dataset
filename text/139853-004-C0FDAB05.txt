Natural gas, colourless, highly flammable gaseous hydrocarbon consisting primarily of methane and ethane. It is a type of petroleum that commonly occurs in association with crude oil. Natural gas is often found dissolved in oil at the high pressures existing in a reservoir, and it can be present as a gas cap above the oil. In many instances it is the pressure of natural gas exerted upon the subterranean oil reservoir that provides the drive to force oil up to the surface. Such natural gas is known as associated gas; it is often considered to be the gaseous phase of the crude oil and usually contains some light liquids such as propane and butane. For this reason associated gas is sometimes called “wet gas.” There are also reservoirs that contain gas and no oil. This gas is termed nonassociated gas. Nonassociated gas, coming from reservoirs that are not connected with any known source of liquid petroleum, is “dry gas.”
The first discoveries of natural gas seeps were made in Iran between 6000 and 2000 bce. Many early writers described the natural petroleum seeps in the Middle East, especially in the Baku region of what is now Azerbaijan. The gas seeps, probably first ignited by lightning, provided the fuel for the “eternal fires” of the fire-worshipping religion of the ancient Persians.
