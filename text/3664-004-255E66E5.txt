Pyralid moth (family Pyralidae or Pyralididae), any of a group of moths in the order Lepidoptera, most members of which have long, narrow forewings, broader hindwings, and a wingspan of 18 to 35 mm (0.75 to 1.5 inches), although a few reach to 75 mm (3 inches). Coloration is dull except for bright metallic markings. Both adults and larvae vary greatly in habitat.
Cosmopolitan pests of stored products include the larvae of the meal moth, Indian meal moth, and Mediterranean flour moth. Meal moth (Pyralis farinalis) caterpillars are white with black heads and live in silken tubes that they spin in such grains as cereals, meal, and flour stored while damp or in damp places. The Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) originated in Europe but is now widespread throughout most of the world. The green or white larvae attack flour, grain, dried fruit, nuts, and other food products. The webs that they spin often contain their excrement and foul the infested material. The white or pink larvae of the Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella) are important pests of stored foods. Spinning silken tubes in which they live and feed, they attack stored grains such as wheat and maize (corn), webbing together masses of the infested grain and excrement.
