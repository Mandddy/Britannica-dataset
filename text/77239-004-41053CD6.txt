Elio Petri,  (born January 29, 1929, Rome, Italy—died November 10, 1982, Rome) Italian motion-picture director and screenwriter.
Petri’s formal education was limited; most of his formative experiences occurred on the streets, in his neighbourhood, and in the local cell of the Italian Communist Party, of which he was a militant member until 1956. That year, when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary, he began to distance himself from communism. He nevertheless maintained a lifelong interest in social issues.
