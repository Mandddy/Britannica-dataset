Ken Kesey, in full Ken Elton Kesey   (born September 17, 1935, La Junta, Colorado, U.S.—died November 10, 2001, Eugene, Oregon) American writer who was a hero of the countercultural revolution and the hippie movement of the 1960s.
Kesey was educated at the University of Oregon and Stanford University. At a Veterans Administration hospital in Menlo Park, California, he was a paid volunteer experimental subject, taking mind-altering drugs and reporting on their effects. This experience and his work as an aide at the hospital served as background for his best-known novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1962; film, 1975), which is set in a mental hospital. He further examined values in conflict in Sometimes a Great Notion (1964).
