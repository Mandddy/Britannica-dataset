Barry Diller,  (born February 2, 1942, San Francisco, California, U.S.) American media executive who served as chairman and CEO of numerous companies, most notably Twentieth Century-Fox (1985–92), where he created the Fox Network, and IAC/InterActiveCorp (2003– ), an Internet venture.
Diller dropped out of the University of California, Los Angeles, and in 1961 he took a job as a mail clerk at the William Morris Agency. In 1966 he began working as a programming assistant at the American Broadcasting Company, where he rose in the ranks to become a vice president of the company. There he gained acclaim for his successful programming innovations such as the TV miniseries—notably Roots—and the made-for-TV movie of the week. In 1974 he moved to Paramount Pictures, where he served as chairman and chief executive. Under his leadership Paramount became the most successful of the Hollywood studios in the late 1970s and the early ’80s, producing such movies as Saturday Night Fever and Raiders of the Lost Ark and the popular television series Cheers. In 1985 he became chairman and chief executive of Twentieth Century-Fox and later, under new owner Rupert Murdoch, was given the job of creating a fourth television network. With programs such as Married…with Children and The Simpsons delivered by satellite to a hastily assembled group of affiliates, the Fox Network succeeded against all odds.
