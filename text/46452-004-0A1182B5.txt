Bengt Lidner,  (born March 16, 1757, Gothenburg, Swed.—died  Jan. 4, 1793, Stockholm) Swedish dramatic and epic poet of early Romanticism, noted for his choice of spectacular subjects.
A courtier in the favour of Gustav III, Lidner toured the continent at royal expense. His best works were written between 1783 and 1787. Grefvinnan Spastaras Död (1783), the text for a cantata, deals with a woman who attempts to rescue her son during an earthquake. Both are killed, and the poem follows the mother to heaven, where she meets Lidner’s mother, who had died when Lidner was a boy. In the operatic libretto Medea (1784), a deceived wife kills her sons on the stage. The heroine of the epic Yttersta Domen (1788; “The Last Judgment”) is Eve: its opening, in which images of sound and light combine to evoke an intense atmosphere of death, is famous. Lidner’s motto In lacrimis voluptas (“There is pleasure in tears”) reflects the emotionally charged atmosphere of his works.
