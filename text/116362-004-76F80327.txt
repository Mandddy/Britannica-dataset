Prize cases,  (1863), in U.S. history, legal dispute in which the Supreme Court upheld President Abraham Lincolnâ€™s seizure of ships that ran the naval blockade prior to the congressional declaration of war in July 1861.
On April 19 and 27, 1861, Lincoln issued proclamations authorizing a blockade of Confederate ports. Congress did not recognize a state of war until July 13. During that interval of almost three months, the Union Navy captured a number of merchant vessels, and those seizures were challenged in court on the basis that Lincoln had exceeded his constitutional authority.
