Panfilo de Narváez,  (born c. 1478, Valladolid, Castile [Spain]—died November 1528, Gulf of Mexico) Spanish conquistador, colonial official, and explorer.
Narváez entered military service as a youth and arrived in Jamaica as one of the island’s first settlers. Later he commanded a company of archers during Diego Velásquez’s campaign to conquer and pacify Cuba. He was rewarded for his services with public offices and extensive land grants on the island. In March 1520 he left Cuba, commanding a fleet of ships and about 900 men with orders from Velásquez to capture and replace Hernán Cortés as ruler of Mexico. Cortés, who had been charged with treason and disloyalty, defeated the expedition. Narváez was taken prisoner with most of his men; he was released the next year on orders from Spain and returned to Cuba.
