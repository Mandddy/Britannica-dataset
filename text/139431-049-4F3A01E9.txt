Sunspot, vortex of gas on the surface of the Sun associated with strong local magnetic activity. Spots look dark only by contrast with the surrounding photosphere, which is several thousand degrees hotter. The dark centre of a spot is called the umbra; the outer, lighter ring is the penumbra. Spots may be several times larger than Earth or so small that telescopic observation is difficult. They may last for months. Single spots do appear, but most are in pairs or groups, with the members of a pair (leader and follower in respect to the direction of the Sunâ€™s rotation) having opposite magnetic polarity. This polarity reverses from one solar cycle (of 11 years duration) to the next; i.e., if leaders in one cycle are north magnetic poles, leaders in the succeeding cycle will be south poles. Leaders and followers in one hemisphere of the Sun are almost always opposite in polarity from their counterparts across the equator.
Some large spots are visible to the unaided eye when the Sun is seen through clouds or in a camera obscura image. But general acceptance of the reality of these apparent flaws in the Sun came only about 1611, when systematic study was begun independently by Galileo Galilei, Thomas Harriot, Johannes Fabricius, and Christoph Scheiner. Samuel Heinrich Schwabe in 1843 announced discovery of the solar cycle, in which the number of spots reaches a maximum about every 11 years on the average, as does solar magnetic activity, including explosive solar flares and coronal mass ejections.
