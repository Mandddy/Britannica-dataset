Kings Canyon National Park, scenic area in the Sierra Nevada, east-central California, U.S. It lies adjacent to and north of Sequoia National Park and is under the same administration; Yosemite National Park is about 40 miles (64 km) to the northwest. Established in 1940, it incorporated General Grant National Park (created 1890), now Grant Grove, a detached section to the southwest. The park has an area of 722 square miles (1,870 square km). Like Sequoia and Yosemite national parks, it contains groves of big trees, or giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum), including Grant and Cedar groves. The grove at Redwood Mountain, covering 3,100 acres (1,255 hectares) and holding some 15,800 trees, is the world’s most extensive remaining stand of giant sequoias. In addition, Giant Sequoia National Monument, established in 2000, encompasses 512 square miles (1,326 square km) of adjacent Sequoia National Forest and preserves most of the other groves of big trees not already federally protected. The monument’s northern section lies immediately west of the national park.
The park’s most spectacular feature is Kings Canyon on the South Fork Kings River (a tributary of the Kings River), carved by glacial action. The granite walls of the canyon in places tower 4,000 feet (1,200 metres) above the canyon floor. Just outside the park, in Sequoia National Forest, the canyon reaches a depth of 8,200 feet (2,500 metres) from the river to the summit of Spanish Mountain (10,051 feet [3,064 metres]). Kings Canyon National Park has many trails, including a portion of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (there combined with the John Muir Trail), which runs along the eastern side of the park. Besides the groves of sequoias, the park’s forests contain sugar and yellow pine, white fir, and incense cedar. Deer, black bears, bighorn sheep, and other wildlife inhabit the area.
