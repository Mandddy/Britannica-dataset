Pekingese, breed of toy dog developed in ancient China, where it was held sacred and was kept as a palace dog by members of the imperial family. It was introduced to the West by English forces that looted the Imperial Palace at Peking (Beijing) in 1860. The Pekingese has been known, both in the East and in the West, as the “lion dog”—presumably because of its appearance, although it is also acclaimed as having lionlike independence and courage. It stands about 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 cm) and weighs up to about 14 pounds (6.5 kg). The celebrated “sleeve dogs” are very small Pekingese once carried by Chinese royalty in the sleeves of their robes. A long-haired dog, the Pekingese has a full mane and heavily haired thighs, forelegs, tail, and toes. Its head is broad and flat, with hanging ears and a short, wrinkled muzzle. The coat may be solid or variegated in colour, but there is always a black mask across the face.
