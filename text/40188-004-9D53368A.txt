Stefan Żeromski,  (born October 14, 1864, Strawczyn, Poland, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died November 20, 1925, Warsaw, Poland) Polish novelist admired for the deep compassion about social problems that he expressed in naturalistic, yet lyrical, novels.
Belonging to a family of impoverished gentry, Żeromski was born in the aftermath of the tragic 1863 January Insurrection against Russian rule, and that fact coloured his work in the years to come. Unable to get a high-school diploma, he entered the only accessible university in Warsaw, one devoted to veterinary medicine. Subsequently he worked first as a resident tutor in country houses and then as an assistant librarian in Switzerland and at the Zamoyski Library in Warsaw (1897–1904). From 1905, while living at Nałęczów, Żeromski furthered the cause of education for the masses and was arrested by the Russian authorities in 1908 for these activities. He subsequently lived in Paris (1909–12) and in Warsaw.
