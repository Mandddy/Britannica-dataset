Yaqui,  Indian people centred in southern Sonora state, on the west coast of Mexico. They speak the Yaqui dialect of the language called Cahita, which belongs to the Uto-Aztecan language family. (The only other surviving speakers of the Cahita language group are the related Mayo people.)
The Yaqui were, and in part remain, settled agriculturists, but they offered a stubborn resistance to the first Spanish invaders in the 16th and 17th centuries. They gradually came under mission influence and settled in church-centred communities, but in the 19th century Mexican encroachments on the fertile lands of their tribal territory led to a series of Yaqui uprisings that were finally quelled with difficulty by the Mexican Army in 1887. Thousands of Yaqui were deported, and the remainder were left greatly reduced in numbers by warfare and emigration. Much of the Yaquiâ€™s tribal lands were restored to them by the Mexican government in the 1930s, however. Since the 1940s, large irrigation projects using the waters of the Yaqui River have shifted the emphasis in Yaqui agriculture from subsistence crops of corn, beans, and squash to the growing of cash crops such as wheat and cotton, and the production of vegetable oils. The Yaqui are Roman Catholic, but the form of their worship is clearly influenced by aboriginal practices. The Yaqui numbered about 25,000 in the late 20th century, with several thousand also living in Arizona in the United States.
