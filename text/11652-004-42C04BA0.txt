Antoine Furetière,  (born Dec. 28, 1619, Paris—died  March 14, 1688, Paris) French novelist, satirist, and lexicographer, remarkable for the variety of his writing.
The son of a lawyer’s clerk, Furetière entered the legal profession but soon resigned his office and took holy orders to qualify himself for benefices, which provided an income that enabled him to pursue his literary vocation. After publishing three books of comic and satirical verse, he wrote Nouvelle Allégorique ou Histoire des derniers troubles arrivés au royaume d’Eloquence (1658), a facetious survey of the contemporary Parisian world of letters, in which he wrote so favourably of the members of the Académie Française that he was, in 1662, himself elected.
