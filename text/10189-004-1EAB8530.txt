Pierre Loti, pseudonym of Louis-marie-julien Viaud   (born Jan. 14, 1850, Rochefort, Fr.—died  June 10, 1923, Hendaye) novelist whose exoticism made him popular in his time and whose themes anticipated some of the central preoccupations of French literature between World Wars.
Loti’s career as a naval officer took him to the Middle and Far East, thus providing him with the exotic settings of his novels and reminiscences. Following his naval schooling and training, he was promoted ship’s lieutenant in 1881 and during 1885–91 saw service in Chinese waters. His subsequent promotions led to an appointment as ship’s captain in 1906.
