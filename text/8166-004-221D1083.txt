Maltese, breed of toy dog named for the island of Malta, where it may have originated about 2,800 years ago. Delicate in appearance but usually vigorous, healthy, affectionate, and lively, the Maltese was once the valued pet of the wealthy and aristocratic. It has a long, silky, pure-white coat, hanging ears, a compact body, and a plumed tail that curves over its back. It stands about 5 inches (13 cm) and weighs up to 7 pounds (3 kg).
