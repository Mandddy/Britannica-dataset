Thomas Corneille,  (born Aug. 20, 1625, Rouen, Fr.—died  Dec. 8, 1709, Les Andelys) French dramatist, younger brother of the great French Classical playwright Pierre Corneille and a highly successful dramatic poet in his own right, whose works helped to confirm the character of the French Classical theatre.
Between 1656 and 1678 Corneille put on no fewer than 16 tragedies, starting with Timocrate (1656), which was among the dramatic successes of the century. His best play is the tragedy Ariane (1672; The Labyrinth, 1795). He also experimented with comedy in the then-popular Spanish style (Le Geôlier de soi-même, 1655), with opera, and with lyric drama.
