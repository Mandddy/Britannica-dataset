Gene Roddenberry, byname of Eugene Wesley Roddenberry   (born Aug. 19, 1921, El Paso, Texas, U.S.—died  Oct. 24, 1991, Santa Monica, Calif.) American writer and television and film producer, creator and executive producer of the popular science-fiction television series Star Trek (1966–69), which spawned other television series and a string of motion pictures.
Roddenberry briefly attended Los Angeles City College, flew B-17 bombers during World War II, and was an airline pilot (1945–49) and a sergeant on the Los Angeles police force (1949–53). He then became a freelance television writer and contributed scripts through 1962 to several network programs, including Dragnet, Highway Patrol, Dr. Kildare, and Have Gun—Will Travel. In 1964 he began trying to sell the idea of Star Trek to producers, but not until Sept. 8, 1966, did the first episode debut on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network. The series was repeatedly threatened with cancellation, but the program’s ardent followers, known as “Trekkies,” formed fan clubs and initiated letter-writing campaigns to keep the series alive until Sept. 2, 1969.
