Copenhagen University Botanical Garden, Danish Københavns Universitet Botanisk Have,  one of the notable botanical gardens of Europe. Founded in 1759 on part of the ancient fortifications of Copenhagen, the garden occupies more than 9 hectares (24 acres) and has about 15,000 kinds of plants, both under glass and outdoors. The outdoor plantings are surprisingly rich, considering the northern climate (latitude 55° N); except for summer annuals, all plants, including many handsome specimen trees, are perennials. A large greenhouse-conservatory covering 3,000 square m (32,000 square feet) displays exceptionally large collections of orchids from Thailand, begonias, and ferns. The garden also has a special air-conditioned greenhouse that can re-create environments suitable for Arctic plants. The university’s botanical museum and herbarium are housed in a building situated within the garden, giving the garden staff ready access to reference works and more than 2 million dried plant specimens.
