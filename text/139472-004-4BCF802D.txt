Xavi, byname of Xavier Hernández Creus  (born January 25, 1980, Terrassa, Spain) Spanish football (soccer) player who was widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world in the early 21st century.
At age 11 Xavi joined the youth squad of FC Barcelona, a first-division football club near his hometown. He advanced through the club’s various junior ranks before making his first-team debut in 1998. In his first season with the team, Barcelona won the 1998–99 La Liga—Spain’s top football league—championship. Xavi’s playing time steadily increased over the following seasons, and he was a key member of the club when it won the 2004–05 La Liga title. Xavi and Barcelona successfully defended the La Liga championship in 2005–06 and captured the Champions League title that season as well. The team bested this accomplishment in 2008–09 as it won the first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season) in Barcelona history—taking the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. Xavi helped Barcelona to additional La Liga titles in 2010–11 and 2012–13, as well as a Copa del Rey victory in 2011–12. In March 2015 he announced that he was leaving Barcelona for Qatar’s Al-Sadd at the end of the 2014–15 season. He finished his storied Barcelona career on a high note as the club won another treble that season.
