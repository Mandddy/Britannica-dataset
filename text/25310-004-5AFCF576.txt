Samuel Freeman Miller,  (born April 5, 1816, Richmond, Ky., U.S.—died  Oct. 13, 1890, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1862–90), a leading opponent of efforts to use the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution to protect business against government regulation. He was spokesman for the court in its first attempt to construe the amendment, passed after the American Civil War largely to assure the rights of the newly freed slaves. He was in the majority then, but his view that the amendment did not bar legislative restraints on industry ceased to prevail by the 1890s and did not again predominate until the late 1930s.
A practicing physician for 12 years, Miller also read law and was admitted to the bar in 1847. His opposition to slavery caused him to move in 1850 from the slave state of Kentucky to the free state of Iowa, where he became a prominent lawyer and a Republican Party leader. Appointed to the Supreme Court by President Abraham Lincoln on July 16, 1862, Miller was the first justice from any state west of the Mississippi River.
