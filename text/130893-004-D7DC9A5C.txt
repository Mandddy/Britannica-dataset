Human microbiome, the full array of microorganisms (the microbiota) that live on and in humans and, more specifically, the collection of microbial genomes that contribute to the broader genetic portrait, or metagenome, of a human. The genomes that constitute the human microbiome represent a remarkably diverse array of microorganisms that includes bacteria, archaea (primitive single-celled organisms), fungi, and even some protozoans and nonliving viruses. Bacteria are by far the most numerous members of the human microbiome: the bacterial population alone is estimated at between 75 trillion and 200 trillion individual organisms, while the entire human body consists of about 50 trillion to 100 trillion somatic (body) cells. The sheer microbial abundance suggests that the human body is in fact a “supraorganism,” a collection of human and microbial cells and genes and thus a blend of human and microbial traits.
The first scientific evidence that microorganisms are part of the normal human system emerged in the mid-1880s, when Austrian pediatrician Theodor Escherich observed a type of bacteria (later named Escherichia coli) in the intestinal flora of healthy children and children affected by diarrheal disease. In the years that followed, scientists described a number of other microorganisms isolated from the human body, including in 1898 the species Veillonella parvula, a bacterial member of the oral, digestive, urinary, and upper respiratory flora, and in 1900 bifidobacteria, members of the intestinal flora. Throughout the 20th century a number of other microorganisms were isolated from the nasal passages, oral cavities, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract and characterized as part of the human microbiota. Although this group of organisms has been conceptualized in various ways since its discovery, the concept of the human microbiome, and thus the intensive study of it, was developed primarily in the first decade of the 21st century.
