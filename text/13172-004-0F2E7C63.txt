Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet,  (born April 29, 1879, St. Helens, Lancashire, Eng.—died March 8, 1961, London) conductor and impresario who founded and led several major orchestras and used his personal fortune for the improvement of orchestral and operatic performances in England.
Beecham was the grandson of the founder of the “Beecham’s pills” business, which provided him with the funds he so lavishly spent on the development of symphonic and operatic music. Beecham studied composition and made his London debut as a conductor in 1905. In 1906 he began a series of concerts with his own New Symphony Orchestra, and in 1909 he formed the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. Using his private fortune, in 1910 he began presenting operas at Covent Garden, Drury Lane, and other theatres. Beecham introduced London audiences to operas by Richard Strauss, Frederick Delius, and various Russian composers, and he helped bring Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes (1911) and the Russian operatic bass Feodor Chaliapin (1913) to perform in England for the first time. He founded the Beecham Opera Company in 1915, and he spent large sums to subsidize performances by various established orchestras during World War I. His musical activities earned him a knighthood in 1916.
