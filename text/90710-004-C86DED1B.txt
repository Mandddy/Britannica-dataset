Viridiana, Spanish dramatic film, released in 1961, that is widely considered one of director Luis Buñuel’s finest and most controversial works. Sharply critical of the Roman Catholic Church, it was banned in Spain and condemned by the Vatican.
The story follows the tumultuous life of a young novice, the beautiful Viridiana (played by Silvia Pinal), on the verge of taking her final vows as a nun. Before doing so, she is persuaded by her Mother Superior to visit her uncle (played by Fernando Rey), who has long been her benefactor. Once at his estate, Viridiana becomes the victim of her depraved uncle’s lust, owing to her resemblance to his late wife, who died on their wedding night. After she refuses to capitulate to his drugged seduction, Viridiana’s uncle commits suicide. She then decides to use his estate as a base for a social experiment, in which she attempts to help an assortment of beggars by giving them a place to live and work. Their corruption overpowers her goodness in a series of increasingly shocking scenes, which include an infamous shot in which the vile beggars freeze into a re-creation of the Last Supper tableau.
