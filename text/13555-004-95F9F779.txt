Ciro Alegría,  (born Nov. 4, 1909, Saltimbanca, Peru—died  Feb. 17, 1967, Lima) Peruvian novelist who wrote about the lives of the Peruvian Indians.
Educated at the National College of San Juan, Alegría acquired a firsthand knowledge of Indian life in his native province of Huamachuco; this first appeared in his novel La serpiente de oro (1935; The Golden Serpent), which portrays the diverse human life to be found along the Marañón River in Peru. Los perros hambrientos (1938; “The Hungry Dogs”) describes the difficulties faced by the sheepherding Indians of the Peruvian highlands. The novel that is generally considered Alegría’s masterpiece is El mundo es ancho y ajeno (1941; Broad and Alien is the World ). It depicts in epic manner the struggles of an Indian tribe to survive in the Peruvian highlands against the greed of land-hungry white men. A collection of short fiction (Duelo de caballeros [1963]) and Novelas completas (1963) were his last works.
