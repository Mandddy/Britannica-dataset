Armando Palacio Valdés,  (born October 4, 1853, Entralgo, Spain—died February 3, 1938, Madrid) one of the most popular 19th-century Spanish novelists, distinguished by his optimism, his charming heroines, his realism, and his qualities of moderation and simplicity.
After studying law at the University of Madrid, Palacio Valdés began his literary career as a critic but soon turned to the novel. His novels are largely autobiographical, particularly Riverita (1886), Maximina (1887), and La novela de un novelista (1921; “The Novel of a Novelist”). He had an early interest in science, and his work reveals a temporary phase of naturalism, notably La espuma (1890; The Froth) and La fe (1892; Faith). Marta y María (1883), with its biblical Martha and Mary theme, is his most profound work. The local colour of Asturias, his native province, abounds in Marta y María, as it does in his other Asturian novels, José (1885), a realistic picture of seafaring life, and La aldea perdida (1903; “The Lost Village”), on the destruction of rural life by civilization. His occasionally excessive sentimentality is mitigated by sincerity and humour.
