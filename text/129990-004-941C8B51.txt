Victor McKusick, in full Victor Almon McKusick  (born Oct. 21, 1921, Parkman, Maine, U.S.—died July 22, 2008, Baltimore, Md.) American physician and genome researcher who pioneered the field of medical genetics.
McKusick was raised on a dairy farm in Maine. He attended Tufts University (1940–43) in Medford, Mass., before transferring to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (M.D., 1946) in Baltimore to train as a cardiologist. There he specialized in the study and treatment of heart murmurs. McKusick later published the influential textbook Cardiovascular Sound in Health and Disease (1958). An encounter with a heart patient whose malfunctioning aorta was symptomatic of Marfan syndrome, a rare inherited disease, triggered McKusick’s switch to genetics. In 1957 he founded the first medical genetics clinic at Johns Hopkins, serving as its director until 1975. McKusick also chaired the department of medicine at Johns Hopkins (1973–85), where he remained as a professor of medical genetics (1985–2007).
