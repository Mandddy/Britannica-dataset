Moravian church, Protestant church founded in the 18th century but tracing its origin to the Unitas Fratrum (“Unity of Brethren”) of the 15th-century Hussite movement in Bohemia and Moravia.
Although suppressed during the Counter-Reformation and proscribed by the Peace of Westphalia (1648), the Brethren survived in Bohemia because of the efforts of a so-called “hidden seed” of loyal adherents. German Pietism in the late 17th century increased the unrest among the underground Protestants in Moravia and Bohemia, and many Brethren fled to Protestant Germany. Pietism also profoundly influenced many nobles, including a young count, Nikolaus Ludwig, Graf von Zinzendorf, who restored the hidden seed. A group adhering to the tradition of the Bohemian Brethren fled Moravia in 1722 and settled on the count’s estate in Saxony, where he had founded Herrnhut as a Christian community. Exiles from Bohemia and Moravia, as well as Pietists from Germany and beyond, were attracted to Herrnhut. The community held services at an assembly hall in Herrnhut and took the sacraments and worshiped in the Lutheran parish church in the nearby village of Berthelsdorf.
