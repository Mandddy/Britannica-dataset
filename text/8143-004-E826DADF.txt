Akita, breed of working dog that originated in the mountains of northern Japan. In 1931 the Japanese government designated the breed as a “natural monument.” It was employed as a hunting and fighting dog and is now trained for police and guard work. The Akita is a powerful, muscular dog with a broad head, erect, pointed ears (small in relation to head size), and a large curved tail carried over the back or curled against the flank. Akitas are bred in a variety of colours and markings, including all-white, brindle, and pinto. Except for the white, all Akitas bear a distinct mask (dark area around the muzzle).
The first Akita was brought to the United States by Helen Keller in 1937, a puppy having been presented to her as a gift during a tour of Japan. Akitas were admitted into the show classifications of the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1973. According to AKC standards, males must be 26 to 28 inches (66 to 71 cm) tall, females 24 to 26 inches (61 to 66 cm).
