Yogi Berra, byname of Lawrence Peter Berra   (born May 12, 1925, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.—died September 22, 2015, West Caldwell, New Jersey) American professional baseball player, manager, and coach who was a key player for the New York Yankees for 18 years (1946–63), during which he played in a record 14 World Series (1947, 1949–53, 1955–58, and 1960–63), winning an unprecedented 10. He also established records (all since broken) for catchers of his era: he held the benchmark for most home runs hit by a catcher (313), most consecutive errorless games (148), and most consecutive chances handled (950). (A chance constitutes any play in which a player can make a putout, an assist, or an error; when a chance is “handled,” either a putout or an assist is the result.)
Berra grew up in the Italian district of St. Louis, Missouri, where he played softball, baseball, soccer, football, and roller hockey. He first played organized baseball with a YMCA team, and he later played American Legion baseball. He batted left-handed and, like most catchers, threw right-handed. (The traditional reason why right-handed catchers predominate is because most batters are right-handed and therefore stand to the left of home plate, so a left-handed catcher is blocked from throwing out base runners.) Berra acquired his famous nickname from a teammate who thought he looked like a Hindu yogi when he sat cross-legged as he waited to bat.
