Sardana, communal dance intimately bound up with Catalan national consciousness. It is danced by men and women who join hands alternately in a closed circle. As they dance to the music of the sardana cobla (orchestra)—typically composed of one flabiol (a fipple flute that calls the dancers together), a tamborí (small drum), two tibles (oboelike double-reed woodwinds), two tenores (larger double-reed woodwinds), two trompetes (brass trumpets), two fiscorns (larger brass trumpets), a trombé (brass trombone), and a contrabaix (contrabass or double bass)—their faces remain solemn and dignified.
The basic pattern of the sardana is a series of long (llarg) and short (curt) steps. The precise combination of those steps is determined by the leader, who signals the steps with a hand squeeze that is passed around the circle. The music is first slow and then picks up speed. The sardana developed in the 19th century from the contrapás, a similar dance with a broken circle.
