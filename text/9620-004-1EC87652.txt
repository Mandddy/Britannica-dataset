Plantain lily (genus Hosta), also called hosta ,  any of about 40 species of hardy herbaceous perennials in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae), native to eastern Asia. Several species are ornamental plants grown for their conspicuous foliage, which may be light-to-dark green, yellow, blue, or variegated. The plants prefer light shade but will grow under a variety of conditions.
Plantain lilies have ribbed leaves borne in a cluster at the base of the plant; the leaves are generally large but range in size from 1.2 to 45 cm (0.5 to 18 inches) long and 1.2 to 30 cm (0.5 to 12 inches) wide. The tubular white or bluish purple flowers are borne in clusters at the tip of stalks that emerge from the leaves. Bloom time varies from late spring to early fall depending on the species. The fruit is a long capsule.
