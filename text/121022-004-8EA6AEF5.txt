Antonio Banderas, in full José Antonio Domínguez Banderas  (born August 10, 1960, Malaga, Spain) Spanish-born film actor whose good looks, sensuality, and emotional range made him a leading international star.
Banderas, the son of a police officer and a teacher, was a soccer protégé as a youth, but a serious foot injury at age 14 dashed his hopes of making the sport his profession. The following year he developed an interest in acting after seeing a stage performance of the rock musical Hair. In 1981 he embarked on a five-year acting stint with the Spanish National Theatre in Madrid. There he was discovered by movie director Pedro Almodóvar, who began offering him roles. In his first movie with Almodóvar, Laberinto de pasiones (1982; Labyrinth of Passion), Banderas received good notices for his role as a gay Islamic terrorist. Under Almodóvar’s direction, the young actor was able to express his talent fully through such unconventional roles as rapist, mental patient, and kidnapper.
