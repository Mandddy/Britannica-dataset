Firefox, in full Mozilla Firefox,  free open-source Web browser created by American software company Mozilla Corporation.
In 1998 American Internet services company Netscape Communications Corp. decided to designate its Navigator browser as open-source for users, who began the development of Mozilla Firefox. The Mozilla team, led by American developers Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross, sought to create a light, fast-loading browser that would appeal to users in its efficiency. In 2002 they released their first browser, Phoenix, which soon included features such as bookmarking (for saving Web site addresses) and the ability to add extensions to modify or customize the browser.
