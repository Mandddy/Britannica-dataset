Neman River, Lithuanian Nemunas, German Memel, or Njemen, Polish Niemen,  river in Belarus and Lithuania. The Neman River is 582 miles (937 km) long and drains about 38,000 square miles (98,000 square km). It rises near Minsk in the Minsk Upland and flows west through a broad, swampy basin; it then turns north into Lithuania, cutting through terminal moraines in a narrow, sinuous valley. Near Kaunas, where there is a hydroelectric plant, it turns west and crosses another marshy basin to enter the Kurisches Gulf of the Baltic Sea south of Klaipeda (Memel; hence the riverâ€™s German name). Navigation on the river is possible for 416 miles (670 km) to Belitsa; much timber is rafted.
