Skipper (family Hesperiidae), any of the approximately 3,500 species of insects (order Lepidoptera) that occur worldwide and are named for their fast, darting flight. Skippers are considered an intermediate form between butterflies and moths. The head and small, stout body of the adult tend to resemble those of a moth. However, when at rest, most skippers hold the first pair of wings vertically, as butterflies do. In addition, skippers usually lack the wing-coupling structures (frenula) typical of most moths. Their antennae are clubbed like those of the butterfly, but in most, the club ends in a slender hooked tip.
Skippers are generally small, but their powerful wing muscles enable them to attain speeds up to 30 km (20 miles) per hour. Larvae feed on plants such as legumes and grasses and usually live inside folded or rolled leaves often woven together. Pupation occurs in thin cocoons of silk or silk and leaves.
