Frederick James Furnivall,  (born Feb. 4, 1825, Egham, Surrey, Eng.—died  July 2, 1910, London) English literary scholar who, partly by his own efforts in textual criticism and partly by founding learned societies, especially the Early English Text Society, was instrumental in initiating a major revival in the study of medieval English literature. Though he first studied law and was called to the bar in 1849, he came to divide his energies between scholarship and social activism, primarily in Christian Socialism and the founding of the Working Men’s College, London (1854).
His interest in medieval English works was chiefly literary, but he also valued them for their illumination of social history and considered it a duty to his countrymen to make them available in accurate editions. Of the many editions that he himself prepared, including other of Chaucer’s works, the most important was the “Six-Text” edition (1866–82) of the Canterbury Tales. He did much to foster the study of Shakespeare, of John Wycliffe, and of the ballad; he also originated the concept and assisted in the preparation of A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles, now the Oxford English Dictionary.
