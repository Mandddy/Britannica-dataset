Guo Jingjing,  (born October 15, 1981, Baoding, Hebei province, China) Chinese diver who competed in four consecutive Summer Olympic Games, winning gold medals in the 3-metre springboard and synchronized 3-metre springboard (with partner Wu Minxia) events in 2004 and repeating the feat in 2008 (again partnered with Wu on the synchronized event). Those accomplishments, coupled with her multiple victories in world diving championships, elevated her to the status of most decorated diver—male or female—in the history of the sport.
Guo grew up in Baoding, China, a city located about 90 miles (140 km) south of Beijing. At age seven she was “discovered” at her elementary school by diving coach Yu Fen, who had risen to prominence coaching Olympic champion Fu Mingxia. Guo, who went to live at the sports school where Yu coached, progressed rapidly under her mentor’s guidance. At age 14 she was selected for China’s Olympic team and made her international debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games. She finished fifth, but it was clear that the teenager had the talent, the willingness to work hard, and a certain, undefinable flair for her sport that made her something special.
