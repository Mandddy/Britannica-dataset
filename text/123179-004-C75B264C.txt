Lantern of the dead, French La Lanterne Des Morts,  small stone structure with windows in the upper part, in which lamps were placed to mark the position of a cemetery at night. Their use, which seems limited to western and central France, is probably owing to a traditional survival of primitive Celtic rather than Christian ideas.
The lantern of the dead usually takes the form of a column, a clustered column, or a small turret, often with a conical cap and a cross at the top. The lamp was hoisted into position by means of a pulley through an opening in the bottom of the lantern. Examples may be found at Cellefrouin and Ciron (12th century), as well as at Antigny (13th century). Later, small chapels superseded the lanterns of the dead.
