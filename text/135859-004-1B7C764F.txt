Blue sheep (genus Pseudois), also called bharal,  either of two species of sheeplike mammals, family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), that inhabit upland slopes in a wide range throughout China, from Inner Mongolia to the Himalayas. Despite their name, blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) are neither blue nor sheep. As morphological, behavioral, and molecular analyses have shown, these slate gray to pale brown sheep-looking caprines are actually more closely related to goats (genus Capra) than to sheep (genus Ovis).
Blue sheep are sexually dimorphic, with males larger (60–75 kg [130–165 pounds]) than females (35–45 kg [80–100 pounds]). Adult males have beautiful, rather large, backward-sweeping horns (over 50 cm [20 inches] long and weighing 7–9 kg [15–20 pounds]), whereas females have very small horns. Like sheep, males lack a beard and do not have calluses on their knees or a strong body odour. Like goats, they have a flat, broad tail with a bare ventral surface, conspicuous markings on their forelegs, and large dew claws. Chromosomal analyses have indicated that the ancestral caprine stock led first to the genus Capra (with 60 diploid chromosomes) and blue sheep (with 54 diploid chromosomes) and then to other genera of Caprinae. A more recent molecular analysis has shown that blue sheep are more closely related to goats than to sheep.
