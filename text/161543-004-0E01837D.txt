Mesothelioma, a tumour that arises from the sheet of cells known as the mesothelium, which lines body cavities and forms the tissue layers referred to as the pleura and the peritoneum. The pleura is located in the chest cavity, either lining the chest wall (parietal pleura) or covering the lung (visceral pleura), and the peritoneum is the corresponding tissue in the abdomen. Roughly 75 percent of mesothelioma cases originate in the chest. Mesothelial cells can also be found in other areas of the body, such as the scrotal sac and the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart), and in rare cases the tumour may arise primarily in those locations.
Some 2,000 to 3,000 cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed annually in the United States and more elsewhere around the world, related in part to asbestos exposure rates. For males born between 1945 and 1950 in western Europe, researchers projected that mesothelioma during the period from 1995 to 2029 would reach rates as high as 1 in 150 because of asbestos exposure in this population.
