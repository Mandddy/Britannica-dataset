Caffiéri family, family of French sculptors and metalworkers known for their vigorous and original works in the Rococo style.
The first prominent member of the family in France was Filippo (or Philippe) Caffiéri (b. 1634, Rome [Italy]—d. September 7, 1716, Paris, France), an Italian-born sculptor in the service of Louis XIV. Filippo’s son Jacques Caffiéri (b. August 25, 1678, Paris—d. November 23, 1755, Paris), became a notable metalworker. He completed many works for the palace at Versailles and other royal residences from 1736 up to the time of his death. Both he and his son Philippe Caffiéri (b. February 19, 1714, Paris—d. October 8, 1774, Paris) were famous for their designs of chandeliers, chests, andirons, and ornamental mounts for various pieces of furniture. Jacques was a master of the Rococo style, which he redeemed from triviality by his vigorous and spontaneous handling of scroll motifs and other decorative elements. Important examples of his work are at Versailles and in the Wallace Collection, London. Jacques’s works bear the simple signature “Caffiéri,” even when they represent a collaboration with his son Philippe. After his father’s death, Philippe obtained many of the royal commissions formerly given to his father. Altar furniture made by him for Notre-Dame de Paris (1759) disappeared during the French Revolution, but an impressive cross and candlesticks made for the Bayeux Cathedral (1771) survive.
