Breisgau,  historic region between the Rhine and the Black Forest in southwestern Germany, now in the South Baden district of the Land (state) Baden-Württemberg. It was part of the frontier region of the Roman Empire known as the Agri Decumates; from c. ad 260 it was occupied by the Germanic Alemanni. The Zähringen family was invested with the countship of Breisgau in the early Middle Ages. In 1120 it founded Freiburg im Breisgau as a free market town. In the 14th century the Habsburgs incorporated most of Breisgau into their domains. Albert VI of Austria established the University of Freiburg in 1457. During the Peasants’ Revolt and the Thirty Years’ War, Breisgau was subjected to destructive sieges and was for a time held by the Swedes. The Habsburgs lost Freiburg to Louis XIV of France by the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1679 but regained it by the Treaty of Rijswijk in 1697. By the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, the county was divided between Württemberg and Baden; the latter acquired full possession of it in 1806.
