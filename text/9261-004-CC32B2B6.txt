James Stephens,  (born Feb. 9, 1880, Dublin—died  Dec. 26, 1950, London) Irish poet and storyteller whose pantheistic philosophy is revealed in his fairy tales set in the Dublin slums of his childhood and in his compassionate poems about animals.
Stephens was working as a solicitor’s clerk and educating himself when he met the Irish poet AE (George William Russell), who encouraged him and helped him publish Insurrections, his first book of poetry, in 1909. His first novel, The Charwoman’s Daughter, appeared in 1911 in The Irish Review, which he had helped found that year. It was his next book, The Crock of Gold (1912), with its rich Celtic theme, that established his fame. Like many of his contemporaries, Stephens was greatly affected by the Easter Rising (1916), a rebellion of Irish republicans against the British, and his book The Insurrection in Dublin (1916) remains a classic account.
