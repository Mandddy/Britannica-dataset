Artificial heart, device that maintains blood circulation and oxygenation in the human body for varying periods of time. The two main types of artificial hearts are the heart-lung machine and the mechanical heart.
The heart-lung machine is a mechanical pump that maintains a patient’s blood circulation and oxygenation during heart surgery by diverting blood from the venous system, directing it through tubing into an artificial lung (oxygenator), and returning it to the body. The oxygenator removes carbon dioxide and adds oxygen to the blood that is pumped into the arterial system. The blood pumped back into the patient’s arteries is sufficient to maintain life at even the most distant parts of the body as well as in those organs with the greatest requirements (e.g., brain, kidneys, and liver). To do this, up to 5 litres (1.3 gallons) or more of blood must be pumped each minute. While the heart is relieved of its pumping duties, it can be stopped, and the surgeon can perform open-heart surgery that may include valve repair or replacement, repair of defects inside the heart, or revascularization of blocked arteries.
