Blasting, process of reducing a solid body, such as rock, to fragments by using an explosive. Conventional blasting operations include (1) drilling holes, (2) placing a charge and detonator in each hole, (3) detonating the charge, and (4) clearing away the broken material.
Upon detonation, the chemical energy in the explosive is liberated, and the compact explosive becomes transformed into a glowing gas with an enormous pressure. In a densely packed hole this pressure can exceed 100,000 atmospheres. The high pressure shatters the area adjacent to the drill hole and exposes the rock beyond to very high stresses and strains that cause cracks to form. Under the influence of the gas pressure, the cracks extend, and the rock in front of the drill hole yields and moves forward. If the distance of the hole to the closest surface is not too great, the rock in front of the hole will break free.
