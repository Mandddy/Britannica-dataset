Harry, count von Arnim, in full Harry Karl Kurt Eduard, Graf von Arnim-Suckow   (born Oct. 3, 1824, Moitzelfitz, Pomerania [now in Poland]—died  May 19, 1881, Nice, France) Prussian diplomat whose indiscreetly expressed opposition to German chancellor Otto von Bismarck led to his prosecution and gave rise to the so-called Arnim Paragraph, an addition to the German criminal code that made unauthorized disclosures of official documents a criminal offense.
After studying law, Arnim entered the diplomatic service in 1850 and served in Rome (1853–55) and Lisbon (1862). He was appointed Prussian envoy to the Holy See in 1864. Before the first Vatican Council of 1869–70, he made proposals intended to prevent a declaration of papal infallibility, which, he foresaw, would create certain political difficulties in Germany.
