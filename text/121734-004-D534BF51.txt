The history of the university began in 1743 when Francis Alison, a Presbyterian clergyman, started teaching classes in his home in New London, Pa. By 1765 these classes were being held in Newark, and four years later the school was chartered as the Academy of Newark. The state of Delaware chartered a college to operate in conjunction with the academy in 1833. New Ark College, a degree-granting institution, opened the next year. The name was changed to Delaware College in 1843. Because of financial problems and the looming American Civil War, the college was forced to close in 1859. With funds provided by the Morrill Act of 1862, the college reopened in 1870. In 1914 the Women’s College began instruction, and in 1921 the name of University of Delaware referred to both the Women’s and Delaware colleges. The university closed the women’s college in 1945 and adopted a permanent coeducational policy.
