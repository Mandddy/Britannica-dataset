Ludwig Renn, pseudonym of Arnold Friedrich Vieth von Golssenau   (born April 22, 1889, Dresden, Germany—died  July 21, 1979, East Berlin, East Germany [now Berlin, Germany]) German novelist, best known for Krieg (1928; War), a novel based on his World War I battle experiences, the narrator and principal character of which was named Ludwig Renn. The stark simplicity of the novel emphasizes the uncompromising brutality of combat.
Born a Saxon nobleman, Renn served as an officer in the Saxon Guards from 1911 through World War I and then studied law, economics, and Russian and was briefly a police officer. Inflation in the 1920s wiped out his fortune, and his experience with nascent fascism in Italy led to his becoming a communist in 1928. He was editor of Linkskurve, the journal of the Union of Proletarian-Revolutionary Writers (1929–32), of which he was also secretary. He also taught war history during that period at the Marxist Workers’ School in Berlin. His Nachkrieg (1930; After War), a novel about the postwar Weimar Republic, mirrors Renn’s political beliefs. For his teaching at the Marxist school, he suffered two months’ detention. He was arrested by the Nazis on the night of the Reichstag fire, which was blamed on the communists, and served two and a half years in prison, until 1935.
