Ketubba, (
        Hebrew: “marriage contract”)  also spelled ketubah or kethubah, plural ketubbot, ketuboth, or ketubbas,  formal Jewish marriage contract written in Aramaic and guaranteeing a bride certain future rights before her marriage. Since Jewish religious law permits a man to divorce his wife at any time for any reason, the ketubba was introduced in ancient times to protect a woman’s rights and to make divorce a costly matter for the husband. The conditions stipulated in the document also guarantee the woman’s right to property when her husband dies. A Jewish wife carefully preserves the ketubba, not as evidence of marriage but for its future value.
In Orthodox and Conservative congregations, the ketubba is a prerequisite for marriage. It must be signed by two witnesses not related to the couple or to each other and, in some congregations, by the bridegroom also. A summary of the conditions is often added in the vernacular, and this is usually read together with the formal document just before or during the marriage ceremony.
