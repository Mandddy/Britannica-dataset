R-selected species, also called r-strategist,  species whose populations are governed by their biotic potential (maximum reproductive capacity, r). Such species make up one of the two generalized life-history strategies posited by American ecologist Robert MacArthur and American biologist Edward O. Wilson; K-selected species—that is, species whose population sizes fluctuate at or near their carrying capacity (K)—make up the second strategy.
The production of numerous small offspring followed by exponential population growth is the defining characteristic of r-selected species. They require short gestation periods, mature quickly (and thus require little or no parental care), and possess short life spans. Unlike K-selected species, members of this group are capable of reproduction at a relatively young age; however, many offspring die before they reach reproductive age.
