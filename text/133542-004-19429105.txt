George Mason,  (born 1725, Fairfax county, Va. [U.S.]—died Oct. 7, 1792, Fairfax county, Va., U.S.) American patriot and statesman who insisted on the protection of individual liberties in the composition of both the Virginia and the U.S. Constitution (1776, 1787). He was ahead of his time in opposing slavery and in rejecting the constitutional compromise that perpetuated it.
As a landowner and near neighbour of George Washington, Mason took a leading part in local affairs. He also became deeply interested in Western expansion and was active in the Ohio Company, organized in 1749 to develop trade and sell land on the upper Ohio River. At about the same time, Mason helped to found the town of Alexandria, Va. Because of ill health and family problems, he generally eschewed public office, though he accepted election to the House of Burgesses in 1759. Except for his membership in the Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia, this was the highest office he ever held—yet few men did more to shape U.S. political institutions.
