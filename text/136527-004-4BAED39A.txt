Nathan Lane, original name Joseph Lane   (born February 3, 1956, Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S.) American stage and film actor, best known for his work in musical comedies, notably the Broadway production of The Producers.
Lane discovered his flair for musical comedy when he appeared in a high-school production of No, No, Nanette, and after graduation he embarked on a career in theatre. Among his early productions was a dinner-theatre staging of Guys and Dolls, in which he played Nathan Detroit. When he was about to join Actors’ Equity and learned that there was already a Joe Lane in the membership, he took that character’s first name. He moved to New York City in the late 1970s, appeared in some Off-Broadway productions, and—in addition to taking odd jobs to help support himself—put together a comedy act with another actor, Patrick Stark. The team, known as Stark and Lane, spent more than two years performing in nightclubs and as the opening act at concerts in Los Angeles, before Lane returned to New York.
