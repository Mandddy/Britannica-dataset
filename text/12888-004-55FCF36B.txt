Lord Randolph Churchill, in full Lord Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill  (born February 13, 1849, London, England—died January 24, 1895, London) British politician who was a precociously influential figure in the Conservative Party and the father of Winston Churchill. He became leader of the House of Commons and chancellor of the Exchequer in 1886, at the age of 37, and seemed certain to be prime minister in due course, but his own miscalculation ended his political career before the year was over.
The third son of the 7th duke of Marlborough, Lord Randolph married a famous beauty, Jeanette (“Jennie”) Jerome (1854–1921) of Brooklyn, New York, in 1874, the same year in which he entered the House of Commons. Until 1880 he exercised his talent for satirical oratory against the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli, earl of Beaconsfield. During William Ewart Gladstone’s Liberal ministry of 1880–85, he joined three other Conservatives—Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, John Eldon Gorst, and Arthur James Balfour—in forming what became known as the Fourth Party, which advocated a set of views announced as “Tory Democracy.”
