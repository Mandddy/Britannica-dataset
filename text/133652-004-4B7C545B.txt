Charles Bonnet,  (born March 13, 1720, Geneva, Switz.â€”died  May 20, 1793, near Geneva) Swiss naturalist and philosophical writer who discovered parthenogenesis (reproduction without fertilization) and developed the catastrophe theory of evolution.
Though Bonnet was a lawyer by profession, his favourite pursuit was natural science. Concentrating first on entomology, he studied the habits of the aphid and found that the female insect was able to reproduce without fertilization by the male. In 1742 he discovered that caterpillars and butterflies breathe through pores, which he named stigmata. Bonnet next turned to botany, studying the structures and functions of leaves.
