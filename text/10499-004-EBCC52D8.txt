Kertanagara,  (flourished  13th century) last king (1268–92) of Tumapel (or Singhasāri) in Java, still venerated among the Javanese as one of their greatest rulers. He united Java, extended his influence over Sumatra, and resisted Mongol attempts to exact tribute from his kingdom.
Kertanagara was the son of princely families—King Vishnuvardhana of Janggala and a princess of Kaḍiri—so that by birth he was a reuniter of the two halves of the Javanese kingdom. Even his name, Kertanagara, meaning “order in the realm,” might refer to reunion, which was the achievement of a great king according to the Javanese dualistic cosmology. Probably for this reason, he was consecrated a king in 1254 before his father’s death. For the ceremony people from Janggala and Kaḍiri went to Kutaraja, the capital city of Tumapel, which was then renamed Singhasāri. From that time Tumapel was also called Singhasāri. Kertanagara was too young to rule the country; therefore, his father was still the de facto ruler. Kertanagara came to power only in 1268.
