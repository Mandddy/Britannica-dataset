Saône River, river that rises near Vioménil, southwest of Épinal, in the Vosges département, Lorraine région, eastern France. It flows southward to join the Rhône River at Lyon after a course of about 300 miles (480 km).
From its source the Saône flows southwestward into Haute-Saône département near Corre, where it meets the Canal de l’Est. It continues through Gray to Pontailler-sur-Saône and crosses Côte d’Or département to enter Saône-et-Loire département, where it is joined by the Doubs River, its major tributary. The river then passes Chalon-sur-Saône, Tournus, Mâcon, and Villefranche before joining the Rhône.
