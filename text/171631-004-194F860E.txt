Pierre-Louis Prieur, byname Prieur de la Marne   (born August 1, 1756, Sommesous, France—died May 31, 1827, Brussels, Netherlands [now in Belgium]) French political figure, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, which ruled Revolutionary France during the period of the Jacobin dictatorship (1793–94). He vigorously enforced the committee’s policies in the antirepublican coastal towns west of Paris.
Prieur was a lawyer at Châlons at the time of his election to the bourgeois Third Estate of the Estates-General (later the National Assembly) of 1789. Since he was one of the few delegates to advocate radical democratic reforms, his sobriquet was altered to Crieur de la Marne (“Crier of the Marne”). Prieur sat with the Montagnards (deputies from the Jacobins) in the National Convention, which first met in September 1792. And on March 26, 1793, he became a member of the Committee of General Defense. On July 10 he was elected to the predominantly Jacobin Committee of Public Safety.
