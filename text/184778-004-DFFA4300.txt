National Portrait Gallery, American gallery dedicated to portraiture of Americans. It is part of the Smithsonian Institution, located in Washington, D.C.
Although the Smithsonian Institution began collecting portraits in 1921, the National Portrait Gallery did not officially open until 1962. In 1976 the gallery, which had long limited its acquisitions to oil paintings, changed its criteria and began to accept portraits in any media, including photography and sculpture. This policy change greatly expanded the collection. The permanent collection consists of portraits of men and women who made important contributions to the United States and its culture. (In 2006 the gallery ended a rule that the person had to have been dead for at least 10 years.) It contains a complete collection of portraits of presidents and first ladies. The gallery considers the historical significance of the subject of a portrait more important than the artistic merit of the portrait and always seeks the most accurate likeness possible.
