Fritz Kortner, original name Fritz Nathan Kohn  (born May 12, 1892, Vienna [Austria]—died July 22, 1970, Munich, West Germany) famous stage and film actor of the 1920s German avant-garde who, after his return from exile in 1949, revitalized German theatre with his innovative concepts in staging and direction. He was known particularly for his unconventional interpretations of the classics.
Kortner graduated from Vienna’s Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. After working for various German theatres, he joined Max Reinhardt in Berlin in 1911 and Leopold Jessner in 1916. He started appearing in silent films in 1916, becoming one of Germany’s most celebrated character actors by playing a variety of sinister or menacing roles. His explosive energy and impressive delivery suited him perfectly for Jessner’s Expressionist drama; among his most famous roles were Gessler in Friedrich Schiller’s Wilhelm Tell and the conniving king in Jessner’s directorial tour de force, Shakespeare’s Richard III.
