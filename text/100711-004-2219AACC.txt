Snow goose (Chen caerulescens), a species of North American goose that may be either white or dark with black wingtips and pink legs and a bill with black gape (“grin”), belonging to the family Anatidae (order Anseriformes). Two subspecies are recognized. The lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) breeds in the Arctic and usually migrates to California and Japan. The greater snow goose (C.c. atlantica) breeds in northwestern Greenland and nearby islands and winters on the east coast of the United States from Chesapeake Bay to North Carolina, especially at Pea Island in the Outer Banks.
The blue goose, with bluish gray body plumage, white head and neck and, sometimes, white breast and belly, was long separated from C. caerulescens but is now recognized as a dark-coloured phase of the lesser snow goose. The two colour forms mate with each other, and the young can be either colour or both.
