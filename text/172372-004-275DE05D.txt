Dial M for Murder, American thriller film, released in 1954, that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and shot in 3-D.
Dial M for Murder, which was based on a play of the same name by Frederick Knott, centres on a murder plan gone wrong. Ray Milland portrayed the retired professional tennis player Tony Wendice, who discovers that his wealthy wife (played by Grace Kelly) had an affair. Believing that she will leave him, Wendice blackmails an old classmate into agreeing to murder her. When the plan goes awry and his wife kills her would-be killer, he devises a method of framing her for murder. The scene in which Kelly wields a pair of scissors is one of Hitchcockâ€™s most famous.
