Ivan Edward Sutherland,  (born May 16, 1938, Hastings, Neb., U.S.) American electrical engineer and computer scientist and winner of the 1988 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for “his pioneering and visionary contributions to computer graphics, starting with Sketchpad, and continuing after.” Sutherland is often recognized as the father of computer graphics.
Sutherland earned a bachelor’s degree (1959) in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University), a master’s degree (1960) in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and a doctorate (1963) in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His doctoral dissertation, “Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System,” under the direction of the information theory pioneer Claude Shannon, was the start of computer graphics, the graphical user interface (GUI), and computer-aided design (CAD) programs.
