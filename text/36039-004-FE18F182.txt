Nicolas Louis de Lacaille,  (born May 15, 1713, Rumigny, France—died  March 21, 1762, Paris) French astronomer who mapped the constellations visible from the Southern Hemisphere and named many of them.
In 1739 Lacaille was appointed professor of mathematics in the Mazarin College, Paris, and in 1741 was admitted to the Academy of Sciences. He led an expedition (1750–54) to the Cape of Good Hope, where he determined in only two years’ time the positions of nearly 10,000 stars—many still referred to by his catalog numbers. His observations from South Africa of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, in conjunction with similar observations already made in the Northern Hemisphere, led to the calculation of more accurate values for the distances of these bodies.
