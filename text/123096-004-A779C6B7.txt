Big Boy, one of the largest and most powerful series of steam locomotives ever built. Produced from 1941 to 1944 by the American Locomotive Company of Schenectady, N.Y., exclusively for the Union Pacific Railroad, the Big Boy locomotives were designed primarily to handle heavy freight traffic in the Wasatch Mountains, where trains faced a continuous grade of 1.55 percent on a stretch of track east of Ogden, Utah.
A Big Boy locomotive along with its tender weighed about 604 tons and measured more than 132 feet (40 metres) in length. It had a maximum power capacity of more than 6,000 horsepower and could haul a 3,600-ton train unassisted up the Wasatch Mountain grade. Pulling freight on level track, it could achieve a speed of 70 miles (112 km) per hour.
