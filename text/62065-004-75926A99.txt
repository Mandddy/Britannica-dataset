Lillie Devereux Blake, née Elizabeth Johnson Devereux  (born Aug. 12, 1833, Raleigh, N.C., U.S.—died Dec. 30, 1913, Englewood, N.J.)  American novelist, essayist, and reformer whose early career as a writer of fiction was succeeded by a zealous activism on behalf of woman suffrage.
Elizabeth Devereux grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, and in New Haven, Connecticut, was educated in a private school and by tutors, and in her youth was a belle of New Haven society. In June 1855 she married a lawyer, with whom she lived in St. Louis, Missouri, and New York City until his death, an apparent suicide, in May 1859. Left penniless, she turned for support to writing, a field in which she had already made a small beginning with the publication of a story in Harper’s Weekly in November 1857, followed by other stories and verses and a moderately successful novel, Southwold (1859). Under sundry pseudonyms she was soon turning out stories and articles by the score for newspapers and magazines. She also completed four other novels, two of which were serialized in the New York Mercury and two of which were published in book form. In 1866 she married Grinfill Blake.
