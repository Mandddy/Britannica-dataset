Eugenius IV, also known as Eugene, original name  Gabriele Condulmaro  (born c. 1383, Venice [Italy]—died  Feb. 23, 1447, Rome) pope from 1431 to 1447.
Formerly an Augustinian monk, he was a cardinal when unanimously elected to succeed Martin V. His pontificate was dominated by his struggle with the Council (1431–37) of Basel, which assembled to effect church reform. When Eugenius sought to dissolve the council because of its hostility toward the papacy, its members affirmed superiority over the Pope (1433). The conflict between Eugenius and the council eased as a possibility emerged of reuniting the Roman and Greek churches. The Greeks preferred negotiating with the Pope and wished to meet in Italy. Eugenius thus ordered the council to transfer to Ferrara in 1438. Many of the bishops obeyed, but dissidents stayed on at Basel as a rump council, whose members Eugenius excommunicated. They, in turn, promptly “deposed” him.
