Robert Redford, in full Charles Robert Redford, Jr.  (born August 18, 1936, Santa Monica, California, U.S.) American motion-picture actor and director known for his boyish good looks, diversity of screen characterizations, commitment to environmental and political causes, and founding the Sundance Institute and Film Festival in Utah.
After years of drifting and studying art in both Europe and the United States, Redford enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and soon thereafter made his Broadway debut in the play Tall Story (1959). Landing roles in several television dramas of the early 1960s, such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, and Route 66, he scored the biggest triumph of his early career with the lead role in Neil Simonâ€™s Broadway hit Barefoot in the Park (1963).
