Indonesian literatures, the poetry and prose writings in Javanese, Malay, Sundanese, and other languages of the peoples of Indonesia. They include works orally transmitted and then preserved in written form by the Indonesian peoples, oral literature, and the modern literatures that began to emerge in the early 20th century as a result of Western influence.
Many of the Indonesian songs, or poems, that were orally transmitted by professional priest-singers embody traditions that have a religious function. Improvisation played a great part in this kind of poetry, and there is reason to believe that in its present form much of it is of no great age. Indonesian orally transmitted prose forms are highly varied and include myths, animal stories and “beast fables,” fairy tales, legends, puzzles and riddles, and anecdotes and adventure stories. The divine heroes and epic animals of these tales show the influence of Indian literature and the written literatures of other neighbouring cultures.
