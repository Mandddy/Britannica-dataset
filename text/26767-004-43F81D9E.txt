Tannhäuser,  (born c. 1200—died c. 1270) German lyric poet who became the hero of a popular legend.
As a professional minnesinger, he served a number of noble patrons, and from his references to them it can be concluded that his career spanned the period c. 1230–c. 1270. Not much is known of his life, except that he traveled widely and almost certainly took part in the Crusade of 1228–29. There are six extant Leiche (lyric lays) by Tannhäuser, a few dance songs and love songs (the latter in a parodistic vein), and a group of Sprüche (gnomic poems).
