Dura-Europus, also spelled Doura-Europus,  ruined Syrian city, located in the Syrian Desert near Dayr al-Zawr. Excavations were carried out first by Franz Cumont (1922–23) and later by M. Rostovtzev (1928–37). Dura was originally a Babylonian town, but it was rebuilt as a military colony about 300 bce by the Seleucids and given the alternative name of Europus after the native city in Macedonia of its reputed founder, Seleucus I Nicator. About 100 bce it fell to the Parthians and became a prosperous caravan city. It was annexed by the Romans in 165 ce; under them it was a frontier fortress. Shortly after 256 ce it was overrun and destroyed by the Sāsānians.
The remains at Dura-Europus give an unusually detailed picture of the everyday life there, and the inscriptions, reliefs, and architecture provide abundant information about the fusion of Greek and Semitic culture. Two structures dating to the 3rd century ce were found to contain extensive wall paintings.
