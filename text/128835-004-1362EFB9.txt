Voice of America (VOA), radio broadcasting network of the U.S. government, a unit of the United States Information Agency (USIA). Its first broadcast, in German, took place on February 24, 1942, and was intended to counter Nazi propaganda among the German people. By the time World War II ended, the VOA was broadcasting 3,200 programs in 40 languages every week. It became part of the USIA when that agency was established in 1953.
The VOAâ€™s function is to promote understanding of the United States and to spread American values. During the Cold War it concentrated its message on the communist countries of eastern and central Europe. Its daily broadcasts include news reports, stories and discussions on American political and cultural events, and editorials setting forth U.S. government policy. The VOA produces and broadcasts radio programs in English and foreign languages and operates broadcasting and relay stations to transmit them.
