Basra, Arabic Al-Baṣrah,  city, capital of Al-Baṣrah muḥāfaẓah (governorate), southeastern Iraq. It is the principal port of Iraq. Basra is situated on the western bank of the Shaṭṭ Al-ʿArab (the waterway formed by the union of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers) at its exit from Lake Al-Ḥammār, 70 miles (110 km) by water above Al-Fāw (Fao) on the Persian Gulf. The adjacent terrain is low-lying and deeply intersected by creeks and small watercourses.
Basra was founded as a military encampment by the second caliph, ʿUmar I, in 638 ce about 8 miles (13 km) from the modern town of Al-Zubayr, Iraq. Its proximity to the Persian Gulf and easy access to both the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and the eastern frontiers encouraged its growth into a real city, despite the harsh climate and the difficulty of supplying the camp with drinking water. The first architecturally significant mosque in Islam was constructed there in 665.
