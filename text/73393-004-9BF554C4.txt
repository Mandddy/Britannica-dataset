Eros, first asteroid found to travel mainly inside the orbit of Mars and the first to be orbited and landed on by a spacecraft. Eros was discovered on August 13, 1898, by German astronomer Gustav Witt at the Urania Observatory in Berlin. It is named for the god of love in Greek mythology.
A member of a group called near-Earth, or Earth-approaching, asteroids, Eros can pass within 22 million km (14 million miles) of Earth. During a close approach in the 1930s (before the development of direct radar ranging), astronomers were able to observe the asteroid’s parallax displacement against the background stars to refine their measurement of Earth’s mean distance from the Sun, the basis for the astronomical unit. Eros was the first asteroid found (1901) to display variations in brightness due to its rotation. Those periodic light fluctuations were later used to determine its rotation period (5.27 hours), its elongated shape, and, with other observations, its size, which is about twice that of New York City’s Manhattan Island. Spectral observations established that Eros belongs to the S compositional class, analogous to the stony meteorites called ordinary chondrites, the most-common class among asteroids located in the inner part of the main asteroid belt.
