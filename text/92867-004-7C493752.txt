Digital camera, device for making digital recordings of images. Texas Instruments Incorporated patented the first filmless electronic camera in 1972. In 1981 Sony Corporation brought out a commercial electronic model, which used a “mini” computer disk drive to store information captured from a video camera. As the cost of electronic components declined and the resolution of the cameras improved, the Eastman Kodak Company began selling professional digital cameras in 1991. Kodak and Apple Computer, which supplied the software for transferring the digital images to a personal computer, introduced the first consumer model in 1994. Digital cameras soon gained market share, gradually relegating most film camera sales to cheap, disposable, single-use models.
Unlike film cameras, digital cameras do not have any mechanical parts (shutters) or chemical agents (film) and rarely have a viewfinder, which is typically replaced by a liquid crystal display (LCD). At the core of a digital camera is a semiconductor device, such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), which measures light intensity and colour (using different filters) transmitted through the camera’s lenses. When light strikes the individual light receptors, or pixels, on the semiconductor, an electric current is induced and is translated into binary digits for storage within another digital medium, such as flash memory (semiconductor devices that do not need power to retain memory).
