Yogurt, also spelled Yoghurt, Yourt, or Yoghourt,  semifluid fermented milk food having a smooth texture and mildly sour flavour because of its lactic acid content. Yogurt may be made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats, or water buffalo. Cow’s milk is used in the United States and north-central Europe; sheep’s and goat’s milk are preferred in Turkey and southeastern Europe; milk from the water buffalo is most commonly used in Egypt and India.
Yogurt may have originated in Turkey, although there are many stories about its discovery. It is made in Turkish homes by boiling milk in an uncovered pan to sterilize it and to evaporate water; after cooling, the milk is inoculated with yogurt from a previous batch, incubated a few hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature before use.
