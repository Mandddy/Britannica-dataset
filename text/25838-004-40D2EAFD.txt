Jean-Baptiste Rousseau,  (born April 6, 1671, Parisâ€”died  March 17, 1741, Brussels) French dramatist and poet who enjoyed great popularity in the witty and decadent Parisian society of his day.
The son of a poor shoemaker, Rousseau as a young man showed a talent for satiric verse. He later attempted to produce several of his plays, becoming involved in a series of disputes and exchanges of insults with detractors and critics. In 1712 he was convicted of defamation because of a satirical verse that he claimed (probably truthfully) he had never written. Exiled from France, he sought refuge in Switzerland. Later he wandered about Europe and eventually died in extreme poverty in Brussels after 29 years in exile. His subject matter was usually based on events and personalities of the day, but his forms and his style were classical. His short, cynical epigrams are considered his best work and are perhaps the best of their kind in the 18th century.
