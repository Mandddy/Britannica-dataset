Belle de jour, (
        French: “Beauty of the Day”) French film drama, released in 1967, that was director Luis Buñuel’s most commercial film and one of the most erotic movies of the 1960s, though largely devoid of nudity.
Catherine Deneuve played Séverine, a beautiful, wealthy, sheltered new bride in a socially advantageous but boring marriage. Despite indulging in a subversive fantasy life, she refuses to sleep with her husband (played by Jean Sorel). When she hears about a brothel that employs housewives to ply their skills in secret, she makes the ominous decision to fulfill her fantasies by serving as a prostitute. The film’s shocking denouement, involving an encounter between Séverine’s husband and a jealous customer, gives the story the aspect of a morality play but, in Buñuel’s mannered world of ethical fluidity, makes it no less perverse.
