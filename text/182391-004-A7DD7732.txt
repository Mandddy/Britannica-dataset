Mark Rylance, in full David Mark Rylance Waters  (born January 18, 1960, Ashford, Kent, England) British theatre actor and director recognized not only for his period-specific enactments of both male and female roles in the works of William Shakespeare but also for his poignant portrayal of contemporary characters. Rylance, habitually consumed by his roles, often kept in character—both onstage and offstage—for the duration of a production.
Although a British citizen, Rylance spent most of his childhood and youth in the United States, living for some years in Connecticut before moving with his family to Wisconsin in 1969. In Wisconsin he attended the University School of Milwaukee, a private college-preparatory institution, where his father held a teaching post. Rylance became involved with Shakespeare—and with acting—during his teen years. At age 16 he participated in his school’s Shakespeare festival, playing the title role in Hamlet. A short while later, at another local Shakespeare celebration, he was praised for his performance as Puck in A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
