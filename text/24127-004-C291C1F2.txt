Gary Cooper, original name Frank James Cooper   (born May 7, 1901, Helena, Mont., U.S.—died May 13, 1961, Los Angeles) American motion-picture actor whose portrayal of homespun characters established him as a glamorized image of the average man. He was one of Hollywood’s most consistently popular and beloved stars.
The son of a Montana Supreme Court justice, Cooper left Grinnell College, Iowa, in 1924 and went to Hollywood, where he earned a living as a cowboy extra and stunt rider. His agent changed his name, and he advanced to leading parts in modestly budgeted westerns that were often box-office hits. A major stroke of luck was his being cast in The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926). He rose to stardom in The Virginian (1929), one of his first talking pictures, and became one of Hollywood’s leading male actors with his appearances in such films as Morocco (1930), A Farewell to Arms (1932), Design for Living (1933), The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935), Desire (1936), The Plainsman (1937), Beau Geste (1939), and The Westerner (1940).
