Francisco Manuel do Nascimento, pseudonym Filinto Elísio  (born December 23, 1734, Lisbon, Portugal—died February 25, 1819, Paris, France) the last of the Portuguese Neoclassical poets, whose conversion late in life to Romanticism helped prepare the way for that movement’s triumph in his country.
Of humble birth and probably illegitimate, Nascimento was educated by Jesuits and ordained in 1754. In 1768 he became tutor to the daughters of the marquis of Alorna and fell in love with one of them, the “Maria” of his poems. Disapproving of the low-born poet’s affection for his daughter, the marquis may have been ultimately responsible for Nascimento’s being denounced to the Inquisition in June 1778. He succeeded in escaping to France and there, except for some four years spent in The Hague during the revolutionary Terror, he remained, living by translations and by taking private pupils.
