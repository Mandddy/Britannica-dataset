Hamada studied ceramics at the Tokyo Industrial College (now the Tokyo Institute of Technology) and was also associated with the Kyōto Ceramic Testing Institute. With the British potter Bernard Leach, who also had great influence on contemporary ceramic art, he established a kiln in St. Ives, Cornwall, Eng., in the early 1920s before establishing his own in Mashiko. Leach and Hamada continued their association in the following decades.
