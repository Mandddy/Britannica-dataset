Silique,  any dry fruit that separates at maturity into two or four segments called valves, leaving a persistent partition that bears the seeds. The valves remain connected at the top. A typical silique is an elongated capsule, such as in cabbage. A silicle, or silicula, is a short and broad silique, as in shepherdâ€™s purse (Capsella). Both types are characteristic of plants in the mustard family.
