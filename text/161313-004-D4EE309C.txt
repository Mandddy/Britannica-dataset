Edna St. Vincent Millay,  (born February 22, 1892, Rockland, Maine, U.S.—died October 19, 1950, Austerlitz, New York) American poet and dramatist who came to personify romantic rebellion and bravado in the 1920s.
Millay was reared in Camden, Maine, by her divorced mother, who recognized and encouraged her talent in writing poetry. Her first published poem appeared in the St. Nicholas Magazine for children in October 1906. She remained at home after her graduation from high school in 1909, and in four years she published five more poems in St. Nicholas. Her first acclaim came when “Renascence” was included in The Lyric Year in 1912; the poem brought Millay to the attention of a benefactor who made it possible for her to attend Vassar College. She graduated in 1917.
