Cockatoo (family Cacatuidae), any of the 21 species of crested parrots (order Psittaciformes) found in Australia as well as in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Most are white with touches of red or yellow; some are black. All have a massive scimitar-like beak for cracking nuts, digging up roots, or prying grubs from wood; feeding is aided by a strong tongue. Cockatoos are treetop, hole-nesting birds; at times they form large, noisy flocks. Because they are showy, inventive, and affectionate, many are caged as pets. Some live more than 50 years.
Especially popular as a pet is the 50-cm- (20-inch-) long sulfur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita), with its handsome crest of narrow, golden, forward-curving feathers. This and other Cacatua species—found in northern and eastern Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania—are mainly white. Highly social birds, sulfur-crested cockatoos forage in flocks numbering from dozens to 100 and congregate at night in regular roosts, often in trees near water. While the flock is feeding, a few individuals stand sentry in trees nearby to alert others to danger with raucous calls. The cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) is another cockatoo that is a popular cage bird. It is a common bird that lives throughout much of Australia.
