The University of San Francisco was founded by Jesuits in 1855 as St. Ignatius Academy. The school was elevated to collegiate status when it was granted a state charter in 1859. It was the first institution of higher education in San Francisco. The first Bachelor of Arts degree was awarded in 1863 and the first masterâ€™s degree in 1867. The school was relocated in 1880 and again in 1906 after the campus was destroyed by the great earthquake and ensuing fire that year. In 1927 the school was established on its current Ignatian Heights campus, and in 1930 it was renamed the University of San Francisco. The university became coeducational in all academic divisions in 1964. In 1978 the university subsumed neighbouring Lone Mountain College. Notable alumni include sports executive Pete Rozelle, basketball player Bill Russell, and former Peruvian Pres. Alejandro Toledo.
