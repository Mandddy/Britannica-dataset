Carangid, any fish of the family Carangidae (order Perciformes), which contains more than 200 species of marine fishes, including such well-known forms as the jacks and pompanos. Carangids are swift, predatory, usually silvery fishes found throughout the world in warm and tropical regions. They are primarily marine, but some live in brackish water or may invade fresh water.
The members of the family vary greatly in form, from elongated and streamlined to very deep-bodied and thin from side to side. In general, however, they bear the following features in common: two dorsal fins, the first of which may be reduced to a few small spines; anal and second dorsal fins usually high in front; first two anal spines separated from the third; pectoral fins slim and often sickle-shaped; tail base very slender; tail strong, either forked or crescent-shaped; scales small; and a lateral line (a series of small sense organs along the sides of the body) often partly or wholly covered with large, hard, keeled scales (scutes).
