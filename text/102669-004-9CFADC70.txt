Battlefield medicine, field of medicine concerned with the prompt treatment of wounded military personnel within the vicinity of a war zone. Studies of historical casualty rates have shown that about half of military personnel killed in action died from the loss of blood and that up to 80 percent died within the first hour of injury on the battlefield. This time period has been dubbed the “golden hour,” when prompt treatment of bleeding has the best chance of preventing death. Thus, developments in military medicine have focused on treatment to quickly stop bleeding and on the provision of immediate medical care. In the early 21st century these developments—together with the use of advanced body armour and helmets, which reduce the incidence of lethal penetrating wounds to the torso and head—led to improved survival rates of troops. However, today many casualties of war survive with debilitating injuries, such as the loss of one or more limbs.
All troops are trained in the basics of first aid, including how to stop bleeding, splint fractures, dress wounds and burns, and administer pain medication. Combat troops are issued a first-aid kit that includes a tourniquet that can be applied with one hand. (Though the use of tourniquets was previously considered undesirable, today the military regards them as lifesaving tools for severe limb wounds.) Also, pressure dressings have been issued that can clot severe bleeding within seconds of being applied. These dressings include HemCon, which is made with chitosan (an extract from shrimp shells), and QuikClot, which is made with inorganic zeolite granules.
