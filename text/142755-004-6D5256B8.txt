Ferrara, city, northeastern Emilia-Romagna regione (region), northern Italy, situated on the Po di Volano, a branch channel of the Po River, northeast of Bologna.
Although it is believed to be the site of the ancient Forum Alieni, from which its name is derived, there is no record of Ferrara earlier than 753 ce, when it was captured from the exarchate of Ravenna by the Lombards. It passed in 774 to the papacy, under which it became an independent commune by the 10th century. The city was occupied successively by Tedaldo di Canossa (988), Countess Matilda of Tuscany (1101), and Frederick I Barbarossa (1158), and its internal history in the 12th century is largely that of the conflict between the rival families of the Salinguerra and the Adelardi. The rights and claims of the latter passed in 1184 by marriage to the house of Este, which after 1240 finally established its undisputed rule over the city.
