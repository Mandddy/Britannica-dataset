Robert Rich, 2nd earl of Warwick, in full Robert Rich, 2nd earl of Warwick, Baron Rich  (born June? 1587—died April 19, 1658, London, Eng.) English colonial administrator and advocate of religious toleration in the North American Colonies. As admiral of the fleet in 1642, he secured the adherence of the navy to the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil Wars (1642–51).
He was the eldest son of Robert Rich, 1st earl of Warwick, and he succeeded to the earldom in 1619. He joined the Bermudas, Guinea, Amazon River, and New England companies, and also the Virginia Company, which was suppressed in 1624 because of a quarrel between Warwick and other members. His Puritan sympathies, which lost him favour at the English court, were advantageous to his association with the New England Colonies. In 1628 he helped the Puritans to obtain the patent for the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1632 he granted the patent for the settlement (1635) of Saybrook, Conn. He was compelled in 1632 to resign the presidency of the New England Company.
