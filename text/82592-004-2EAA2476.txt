Anne Bradstreet, née Anne Dudley  (born c. 1612, Northampton, Northamptonshire?, England—died September 16, 1672, Andover, Massachusetts Bay Colony [U.S.]) one of the first poets to write English verse in the American colonies. Long considered primarily of historical interest, she won critical acceptance in the 20th century as a writer of enduring verse, particularly for her sequence of religious poems, “Contemplations,” written for her family and not published until the mid-19th century.
Anne Dudley was the daughter of Thomas Dudley, chief steward to Theophilus Clinton, the Puritan Earl of Lincoln. She married Simon Bradstreet, another protégé of the earl’s, when she was 16, and two years later she, her husband, and her parents sailed with other Puritans to settle on Massachusetts Bay.
