Guyot, also called tablemount ,  isolated submarine volcanic mountain with a flat summit more than 200 metres (660 feet) below sea level. Such flat tops may have diameters greater than 10 km (6 miles). (The term derives from the Swiss American geologist Arnold Henry Guyot.)
In the Pacific Ocean, where guyots are most abundant, most summits lie 1,000 to 2,000 metres (3,300 to 6,600 feet) below sea level. Their sides, like those of other submarine volcanoes and volcanic islands, are slightly concave, rising gently from the surrounding deep-sea floor and steepening to about 20Â° at their summits.
