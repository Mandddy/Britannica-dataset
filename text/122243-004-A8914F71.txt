Joe Paterno, byname of Joseph Vincent Paterno, also called JoePa  (born December 21, 1926, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died January 22, 2012, State College, Pennsylvania) American collegiate gridiron football coach, who, as head coach at Pennsylvania State University (1966–2011), was the winningest major-college coach in the history of the sport, with 409 career victories, but whose accomplishments were in many ways overshadowed by a sex-abuse scandal that occurred during his tenure.
Paterno served in the U.S. Army in the final year of World War II before accepting an athletic scholarship to Brown University, where he studied English literature and played quarterback for the football team. Upon graduation in 1950, he intended to enroll in law school but was lured away when his former coach at Brown, Charles (“Rip”) Engle, became head coach at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). After 16 years as Engle’s assistant, Paterno succeeded him in 1966.
