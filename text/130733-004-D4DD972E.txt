Burkitt lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system that has an especially high incidence in equatorial Africa among children 3 to 16 years of age. The disease is characterized by tumours of the jaw bones and abdomen and is named after Denis Burkitt, who mapped its peculiar geographic distribution across Africa in the 1950s.
The Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis, is present in most persons afflicted with Burkitt lymphoma. However, this cancer is occasionally seen in areas of the world where it is not associated with the virus. Burkitt lymphoma occurs more readily in persons who have been weakened by malaria and in persons suffering from AIDS.
