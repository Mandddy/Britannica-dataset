Lee Bontecou,  (born January 15, 1931, Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.) American artist whose work ranged from dark, dramatic abstract constructions to softer, transparent natural forms, evoking a correspondingly broad range of response.
Bontecou studied art at Bradford Junior College (now Bradford College) in Massachusetts through 1952 and in New York City at the Art Students League from 1952 to 1955 with the sculptor William Zorach. She also spent the summer of 1954 at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where she learned to weld. She received a Fulbright scholarship to study in Rome in 1957â€“58. In 1959 she had her first solo exhibition, and the next year she first exhibited at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City, where she became one of the first female artists he represented.
