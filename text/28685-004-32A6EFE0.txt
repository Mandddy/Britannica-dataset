Amenhotep, son of Hapu, high official of the reign of Amenhotep III of ancient Egypt (reigned 1390â€“53 bce), who was greatly honoured by the king within his lifetime and was deified more than 1,000 years later during the Ptolemaic era.
Amenhotep rose through the ranks of government service, becoming scribe of the recruits, a military office, under Amenhotep III. While in the Nile River delta, Amenhotep was charged with positioning troops at checkpoints on the branches of the Nile to regulate entry into Egypt by sea; he also checked on the infiltration of Bedouin tribesmen by land. On one of his statues, he is called a general of the army.
