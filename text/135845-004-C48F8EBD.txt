Richard Matthew Stallman,  (born March 16, 1953, New York, N.Y., U.S.) American computer programmer, free-software advocate, and founder of the Free Software Foundation.
Stallman earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from Harvard University in 1974. In 1971, as a freshman at Harvard, he had begun working at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he wrote the Emacs text editor in the C computer programming language with James Gosling (who later developed Java). In 1983 Stallman began working in his personal time on his GNU Project, or GNU operating system. GNU was intended to be a free version of AT&amp;T’s UNIX—the name GNU was created as a recursive acronym of “GNU’s not UNIX.”
