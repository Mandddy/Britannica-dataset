Auguste Chouteau, in full René Auguste Chouteau  (baptized September 7, 1749, New Orleans [now in Louisiana, U.S.]—died February 24, 1829, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.) wealthy fur trader, cofounder of St. Louis, and leading citizen of the Missouri Territory.
Chouteau was an infant when his mother separated from his father. In 1757 she formed a liaison with Pierre Laclède Liguest, who took Auguste and the rest of the family to the Illinois country in 1763. The following year 14-year-old Auguste commanded a group of 30 men who built a village on the west bank of the Mississippi at the junction of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Laclède, under whose direction the village was created, named the new settlement St. Louis. From that time on he was one of the growing town’s most influential citizens, eventually becoming the leader of its economic and social life.
