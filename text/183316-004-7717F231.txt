Cephisodotus the Elder,  (flourished c. 400 bc) Greek sculptor, assumed to be the father of Praxiteles. He made certain statues for the city of Megalopolis, founded in 370 bce.
A noted work of his was Eirene (Peace) Bearing Plutus (Wealth), a grouping recalled in Praxitelesâ€™ more-famous Hermes Carrying the Infant Dionysus. Cephisodotus should not be confused with Cephisodotus the Younger, a son of Praxiteles, noted for portrait sculptures, none of which has survived.
