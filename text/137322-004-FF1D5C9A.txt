Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), Arctic bird of prey of the family Falconidae that is the world’s largest falcon. Confined as a breeder to the circumpolar region except for isolated populations in Central Asian highlands, it is sometimes seen at lower latitudes in winters when food is scarce. The gyrfalcon varies from pure white with black speckling to dark gray with barring. The legs are fully feathered. The gyrfalcon may reach 60 cm (2 feet) in length, and females, which average 1,400–2,100 grams (3.1–4.6 pounds), weigh nearly twice as much as males.
The species prefers cliff faces for nesting sites; however, they occasionally use nests abandoned by ravens (Corvus corax) in trees. Near the end of April, female gyrfalcons lay a clutch of up to five eggs, which are incubated by both parents. All eggs hatch approximately 35 days after they are laid, and young falcons leave the nest to hunt and forage on their own some six to eight weeks later. Both sexes reach sexual maturity between ages two and three.
