Goodman Ace,  (born Jan. 15, 1899, Kansas City, Mo., U.S.—died  March 25, 1982, New York, N.Y.) American radio writer and performer and producer-writer for television, whose literate writing, wry humour, and relaxed style influenced numerous radio and television writers from the 1930s on.
From childhood Ace wanted to be a writer, and his writing was admired by his teachers. He was editor of his high school newspaper when he met young Jane Sherwood (1905–74), whom he later married and who, as Jane Ace, was his partner in the most influential years of his career. He was hired as a cub reporter by the Kansas City Post, then became its motion-picture critic. He took on a second job with a local radio station and was given a 15-minute daily program. When the participants in the ensuing 15-minute program failed to appear one day, Ace asked his wife to join him and they conducted an ad-lib commentary on a game of bridge that they had played the previous evening. This relaxed and natural conversation, punctuated by Jane Ace’s malapropisms—e.g., “We’re all cremated equal”—won instant popularity and evolved rapidly into their influential and long-running network radio program, “Easy Aces” (1928–45). A translation of the comedy show to television was attempted in 1949 but was withdrawn the following year.
