Battering ram, ancient and medieval weapon consisting of a heavy timber, typically with a metal knob or point at the front. Such devices were used to batter down the gates or walls of a besieged city or castle. The ram itself, usually suspended by ropes from the roof of a movable shed, was swung back and forth by its operators against the besieged structure. The roof of the shed was usually covered with animal skins to protect the weaponâ€™s operators from bombardment with stones or fiery materials.
