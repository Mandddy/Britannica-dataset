Manchester terrier, breed of dog developed in England from the whippet, a racing dog, and the black-and-tan terrier, a valued ratter, to combine the talents of each. In 1860 the breed was named after the city of Manchester, a breeding centre, but it was often called the black-and-tan terrier until the 1920s. A sleek, shorthaired dog, the Manchester has a long, narrow head, small bright eyes, and a glossy black coat with tan on the head, chest, and legs. There are two varieties, the standard and the toy. The standard stands 14 to 16 inches (35.5 to 40.5 cm), weighs more than 12 pounds (5 kg) but does not exceed 22 pounds (10 kg), and has erect or folded (button) ears. The toy stands about 6 to 7 inches (15 to 18 cm), weighs 12 pounds (5 kg) or less, and has erect ears.
