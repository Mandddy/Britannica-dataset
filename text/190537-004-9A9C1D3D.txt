Joseph Jenkins Roberts,  (born March 15, 1809, Petersburg, Va., U.S.—died Feb. 24, 1876, Monrovia, Liberia) American-born, first president of Liberia (1848–56).
A native of Virginia, Roberts was the son of free “blacks” whose heritage was more than seven-eighths white. At the age of 20 he immigrated to Liberia with his mother and younger brothers, became a merchant, and also became an unofficial aide to the white governor of the colony, Thomas H. Buchanan, a member of the American Colonization Society, which sought the return of American freedmen to Africa. On Buchanan’s death in 1842, Roberts was appointed the first black governor of the colony.
