Colmar, baron von der Goltz, in full Wilhelm Leopold Colmar, baron von der Goltz, Turkish title Goltz Pasha   (born Aug. 12, 1843, near Labiau, East Prussia [now Polessk, Russia]—died April 19, 1916, Baghdad, Iraq, Ottoman Empire [now in Iraq]) Prussian soldier, military teacher, and writer, an imperial German field marshal who reorganized the Turkish army (1883–96), and who served as commander in chief of Turkish forces against the British in Mesopotamia (Iraq) during World War I. Despite his advanced age, he successfully conducted the 143-day siege of General Sir Charles Townshend’s British contingent at Kut (1915–16).
A soldier from 1861, Goltz taught military history at the military academy in Berlin (1878–83) and gained a reputation as one of Germany’s major theorists of warfare. Sent to Turkey in June 1883, he modernized its army so effectively that, after his return to Germany, Turkey was winning the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 decisively until the major European powers intervened to stop the conflict.
