Bookplate,  a label with a printed design intended to indicate ownership, usually pasted inside the front cover of a book. Bookplates probably originated in Germany, where the earliest known example, dated about the middle of the 15th century, is found. The earliest dated bookplate extant is also German, from 1516. The earliest dated example by an American engraver is a bookplate for Thomas Dering in 1749.
Early armorial bookplates in 16th-century England consisted of a simple unornamented shield, symmetrically mantled helmet, crest, and a scroll beneath for the ownerâ€™s name. Ornamentation waxed gradually until about 1770, when classical motifs regained favour.
