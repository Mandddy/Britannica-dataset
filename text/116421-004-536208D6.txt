Pintail,  any of four species of sleek, long-tailed, long-necked dabbling ducks of the genus Anas (family Anatidae); they are swift fliers and popular game birds. The common, or northern, pintail (A. acuta), widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, is a long-distance flier; some Alaskan birds winter as far away as Hawaii. Pairs form at the wintering ground, and the males follow the females back to their summer range. The common pintail is 66–75 cm (26–30 inches) long and weighs about 900 g (2 pounds). The male has a brown head and throat, white breast, and gray back. The black tail is distinctive for its long central feathers. The female is mottled brown. About eight olive-coloured eggs are laid in a nest in marshes or on prairies. The preferred diet is seeds. The brown pintail (A. georgica), also called the yellow-billed, or Chilean, pintail, and the Bahama, or white-cheeked, pintail (A. bahamensis) are primarily South American species. The red-billed pintail (A. erythrorhyncha) is a grayish African species similar to its New World counterparts except for a red bill.
