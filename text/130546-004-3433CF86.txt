Pernambuco, estado (state) of northeastern Brazil, situated near the eastern tip of the South American coastline’s bulge into the Atlantic Ocean. It is bounded on the east by the Atlantic, on the south by the states of Alagoas and Bahia, on the west by Piauí, and on the north by Ceará and Paraíba. The state capital is Recife.
The first permanent European settlement of Pernambuco was at Olinda in 1535 by Duarte Coelho Pereira, who had been granted a captaincy extending from the mouth of the São Francisco River northward to the vicinity of modern Recife. The Dutch occupied the region from 1630 to 1654, and during their occupation a well-planned town was built where present-day Recife is located. This became the administrative capital. Pernambuco was ably governed by the Dutch and prospered with the production of sugar in the plantations located in the rich alluvial soil along the coast. Portuguese rule replaced that of the Dutch in Pernambuco in 1654.
