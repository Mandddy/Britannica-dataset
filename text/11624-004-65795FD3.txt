Joseph-Simon Gallieni,  (born April 24, 1849, Saint-Béat, Fr.—died May 27, 1916, Versailles) French army officer figure who successfully directed the pacification of the French Sudan and Madagascar and the integration of those African territories into the French colonial empire.
After training at the military academy of Saint-Cyr and serving in the Franco-German War (1870–71), Gallieni was sent to Africa in the mid-1870s. As a captain in 1881 he was captured by the forces of the amīr Ahmadou in the Upper Niger region, but within a year he had extracted exclusive privileges for France in that area.
