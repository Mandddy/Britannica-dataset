K’Naan, byname of Keinan Abdi Warsame  (born 1978, Mogadishu, Somalia) Somali-born Canadian hip-hop musician of the early 21st century whose brightly melodic songs and clever socially conscious lyrics demonstrated international appeal and made him an ambassador for the plight of his homeland.
K’Naan grew up in Mogadishu in an artistic family—his grandfather was a celebrated poet and his aunt a popular singer—and as a child he too displayed a gift for reciting verse. He became drawn to American hip-hop after his father, who was living in New York City, sent him records, and he later taught himself English in part by phonetically imitating the rap songs he admired. When civil war broke out in Somalia in 1991, he fled with his mother and two siblings, settling first in New York City, where he reconnected with his father, and then in a community of Somali immigrants in Toronto.
