Sabi River, also called Save River,  river of southeastern Africa, flowing through Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The river rises as the Sabi about 50 miles (80 km) south of Harare (formerly Salisbury) and flows southeast from the Zimbabwean highveld to its confluence with the Odzi. It then turns south, drops over the Chivirira (“Place of Boiling”) Falls, and is joined by the Lundi at the Mozambique border. The river continues as the Save, following an east-northeasterly course to its mouth near Mambone on the Mozambique Channel of the Indian Ocean.
The 400-mile-long river flows through fertile country until it reaches the Zimbabwean lowveld, where a complex irrigation system (the Sabi-Limpopo Project, begun in 1965) waters about 370,000 acres (150,000 hectares), originally for sugar cultivation, later also for wheat, rice, cotton, and citrus fruit. The Sabi is crossed by the 1,080-foot (329-metre) single-span Birchenough Bridge, 83 miles (133 km) south of Mutare (formerly Umtali), just north of its confluence with the Devure River. The river is navigable by light craft for 100 miles (160 km) above its mouth.
