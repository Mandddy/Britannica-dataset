Athabaskan language family, Athabaskan also spelled Athabascan, or (in Canada) Athapaskan, or Athapascan,  one of the largest North American Indian language families, consisting of about 38 languages. Speakers of Athabaskan languages often use the same term for a language and its associated ethnic group (similar to the use of ‘English’ for both a language and a people), typically naming these with some form of ‘person’ or ‘human,’ as with Navajo diné. The Athabaskan family is a branch of the Athabaskan-Eyak subgroup of the Na-Dené language phylum, which was named for the words for ‘person’ in Tlingit and Athabaskan.
The languages in this family are spoken in three discontinuous geographic regions: the Pacific Coast, the southwestern United States, and northwestern Canada and the Alaskan interior. The languages of the Pacific Coast subgroup were spoken in northern California and southern Oregon by peoples including the Hupa, Mattole, Kato, Tututni, Galice, and Tolowa. Of these, only two languages, Hupa and Tolowa, are still spoken. The southwestern United States is home to the Apachean subgroup, which includes Navajo and the languages spoken by the Apache peoples. The Apachean languages are spoken mainly in Arizona and New Mexico. The languages spoken in the interior of Alaska and northwestern Canada include those of the Carrier, Dene Sųɬiné (formerly Chipewyan), Dogrib, and Slave peoples. Most Athabaskan languages are in danger of becoming extinct. The languages with the greatest number of speakers are currently Navajo, Western Apache, Slave, Dogrib, and Dene Sųɬiné.
