Children’s game, any of the amusements and pastimes of children that may involve spontaneous, unstructured activity, based mostly on fantasy and imagination, or organized games with set rules. Many games are derived from everyday life and reflect the culture from which they developed.
Some children’s games have been played for centuries. Swings existed on the island of Crete in 1600 bce, and jacks, or knucklebones, a game that involves tossing and then catching five or more jackstones, was played in ancient Greece. Both blindman’s buff and a chase game, in which one team chases another team depending on the toss of a coin or disk, date from 2,000 years ago. As social attitudes changed, some games became less popular, while others, especially those that involved violence toward animals, eventually disappeared. A few children’s games became more structured and often lost their entertainment value.
