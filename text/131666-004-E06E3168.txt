Archean Eon, also spelled Archaean Eon,  the earlier of the two formal divisions of Precambrian time (about 4.6 billion to 541 million years ago). The Archean Eon began about 4 billion years ago with the formation of Earth’s crust and extended to the start of the Proterozoic Eon 2.5 billion years ago; the latter is the second formal division of Precambrian time. The Archean Eon was preceded by the Hadean Eon, an informal division of geologic time spanning from 4.6 billion to 4 billion years ago and characterized by Earth’s initial formation. Records of Earth’s primitive atmosphere and oceans emerge in the earliest Archean (Eoarchean Era), and evidence of the earliest primitive life-forms—bacteria and blue-green algae—appears in rocks about 3.5–3.7 billion years old. Archean greenstone-granite belts contain many economic mineral deposits, including gold and silver.
The start of the Archean Eon is only defined by the isotopic age of the earliest rocks. Prior to the Archean Eon, the Earth was in the astronomical (Hadean) stage of planetary accretion that began about 4.6 billion years ago; no rocks are preserved from this stage. The earliest terrestrial materials are not rocks but minerals. In Western Australia some sedimentary conglomerates, dated to 3.3 billion years ago, contain relict detrital zircon grains that have isotopic ages between 4.2 and 4.4 billion years. These grains must have been transported by rivers from a source area, the location of which has never been found; it was possibly destroyed by meteorite impacts—quite frequent on both the Earth and the Moon before 4 billion years ago.
