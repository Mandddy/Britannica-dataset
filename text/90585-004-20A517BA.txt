Jerry Lewis, original name Joseph Levitch  (born March 16, 1926, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.) American comedian, actor, and director whose unrestrained comic style made him one of the most popular performers of the 1950s and ’60s.
Lewis was born into a vaudeville family, and at age 12 he developed a comedy act in which he mimed to records. He dropped out of high school in order to perform his specialty in New York City theatres, burlesque shows, and nightclubs. He first met singer Dean Martin in 1944, and two years later they officially became a performing team. Their act consisted of Martin singing, Lewis clowning, and both joining forces for a rousing finale of music and comedy. Well-received performances in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and at New York City’s Copacabana nightclub resulted in an offer from Paramount.
