Plasmapause,  portion of the magnetosphere that rotates with the Earth at about four Earth radii (approximately 26,000 km, or 16,000 miles); beyond this region there is a rapid decrease in electron concentrations, and their circulation pattern is quite different. Under very quiet solar conditions, the plasmapause may extend to nearly seven Earth radii, and with very disturbed conditions it contracts to about three Earth radii.
