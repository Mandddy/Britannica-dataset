Haleakala National Park, area centred on Haleakala Crater, south-central Maui island, Hawaii, U.S. Authorized as a part of Hawaii National Park (now Hawaii Volcanoes National Park) in 1916, Haleakala Crater was redesignated a separate park in 1961. The 47-square-mile (122-square-km) park now includes that volcanic crater, Kipahulu Valley (added 1951), and the pools of the ‘Ohe‘o Gulch area (added 1969) on the eastern slope.
Haleakala (meaning “House of the Sun” in Hawaiian) is a dormant shield volcano with one of the world’s largest volcanic craters. Its rim reaches an elevation of 10,023 feet (3,055 metres) at Red Hill on the southwest. The crater is 7.5 miles (12 km) long and 2.5 miles (4 km) wide and has a circumference of about 20 miles (30 km); its floor is about 2,300 feet (700 metres) below the Haleakala Visitor Center, situated 9,740 feet (2,969 metres) high on the rim. The volcano last erupted about 1790. Reddish cinder cones are scattered across the floor of the crater, together with black lava beds.
