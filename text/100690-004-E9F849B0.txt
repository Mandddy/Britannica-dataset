Jay, any of about 35 to 40 bird species belonging to the family Corvidae (order Passeriformes) that inhabit woodlands and are known for their bold, raucous manner. Most are found in the New World, but several are Eurasian. Jays are nearly omnivorous; some are egg stealers, and many store seeds and nuts for winter use. They make a twiggy, cuplike nest in a tree. After breeding, most species are gregarious.
The 30-cm (12-inch) blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), blue and white with a narrow black neckline, is found in North America east of the Rockies. Westward it is replaced by the dark blue, black-crested Stellerâ€™s jay (C. stelleri). The gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis) inhabits the northern reaches of the United States and most of Canada.
