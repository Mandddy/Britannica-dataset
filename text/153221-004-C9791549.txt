Etsy, American e-commerce company, founded in 2005 by entrepreneur Rob Kalin and partners Chris Maguire and Haim Schoppik, that provides a global Internet marketplace for handmade wares. The company’s headquarters are in Brooklyn, New York.
Sellers create personal shops through the Etsy Web site, which is collectively searched by buyers. There are three broad categories of goods that may be sold: handmade items, such as hand-beaded jewelry, hand-knit scarves, and handmade soaps and candies; vintage items 20 years or older, such as premade and resold clothing and antiques; and craft supplies, such as buttons, feathers, and crafting patterns. Items that cannot be classified into these categories are prohibited, as are handmade items made by someone other than the seller. Many of the goods for sale are unique creations, and many sellers provide the option of creating custom pieces. Etsy gives users the ability to organize items for sale into “Treasury” lists, often collections from a variety of shops that all have a common theme, such as colour, material, or aesthetic. Users may also search for items by colour or location (to facilitate buying locally made items) or by “Taste Test,” a function that allows the user to choose an image that suits the user’s own personal taste and browse similar items.
