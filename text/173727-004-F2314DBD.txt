Henrik Arnold Wergeland,  (born June 17, 1808, Kristiansand, Norway—died July 12, 1845, Christiania [now Oslo]) Norway’s great national poet, symbol of Norway’s independence, whose humanitarian activity, revolutionary ideas, and love of freedom made him a legendary figure. The clash between his faction (the “patriots”) and the pro-Danish “intelligentsia” led by Johan Welhaven marked the beginning of an ideological conflict that persisted throughout the century.
Of Wergeland’s enormous and varied output, his poetry has stood the test of time. Some of the best known titles are Skabelsen, mennesket og messias (1830; “Creation, Humanity, and Messiah”), Digte, første ring (1829; “Poems, First Cycle,” selections from this and later cycles translated in Poems, 1929), Spaniolen (1833; “The Spaniard”), For arbeidsklassen (“For the Working Class”), and Jøden (1842; “The Jew”). His narrative poems, Jan van Huysums blomsterstykke (1840; “Jan van Huysum’s Flowerpiece”) and Den Engelske lods (1844; “The English Pilot”) are often cited as his finest works.
