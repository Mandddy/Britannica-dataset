Saint Clair River, outlet for Lake Huron, forming part of the boundary between Michigan, U.S. (west), and Ontario, Can. (east). Flowing southward into Lake Saint Clair, with a fall of 5.7 feet (1.7 m) in 39 miles (63 km), the river discharges through a silty, seven-mouth delta, with the South Channel (27-foot [8-metre] minimum depth) used for deep-drafted vessels. The St. Clair delta is the worldâ€™s largest delta that enters a freshwater lake. The islands in the delta form popular summer resorts, the largest being Harsens Island, Mich., and Walpole, Ont. The river is an important link in the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the main ports are Port Huron, Mich., and Sarnia-Clearwater, Ont.
