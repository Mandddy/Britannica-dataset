Ray LaHood, in full Raymond H. LaHood  (born December 6, 1945, Peoria, Illinois, U.S.) American politician who served as a Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives (1995–2009) before becoming U.S. secretary of transportation (2009–13) in the administration of Democratic Pres. Barack Obama.
LaHood grew up in the Peoria, Illinois, area, and he earned a bachelor’s degree in education and sociology from Bradley University in 1971. He worked as a teacher and as an urban planner before entering politics in 1977 as an aide to U.S. Rep. Thomas Railsback. In 1982 LaHood finished the term of a retiring Illinois state representative, but he was unsuccessful in his bid to win the seat outright. The following year he joined the staff of U.S. House of Representatives minority leader Robert Michel, a career politician who was known for his ability to broker deals that crossed party lines. He was named Michel’s chief of staff in 1990, and, upon Michel’s retirement in 1994, LaHood was elected to fill his mentor’s vacant congressional seat.
