Brown trout, also called German brown trout (Salmo trutta),  prized and wary European game fish favoured for the table. The brown trout, which includes several varieties such as the Loch Leven trout of Great Britain, is of the family Salmonidae. It has been introduced to many other areas of the world and is recognized by the light-ringed black spots on the brown body. It is widely transplanted because it can thrive in warmer waters than most trout. Average individuals grow to about 9 kilograms (20 pounds); however, some specimens can weigh as much as 24 kilograms (53 pounds). Ocean-going individuals, called sea trout, are larger than freshwater forms and provide good sport, as do those that enter large lakes.
