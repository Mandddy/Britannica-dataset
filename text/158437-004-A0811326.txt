Jerboa, any of 33 species of long-tailed leaping rodents well adapted to the deserts and steppes of eastern Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. Jerboas are mouselike, with bodies ranging from 5 to 15 cm (2 to 5.9 inches) in length and long tails of 7 to 25 cm. Certain traits are highly variable between species, particularly the size of the ears, which range from small and round to slender and rabbitlike or remarkably large and broad. Hind toes number from three to five, but all species have short forelegs and extremely long hind legs. The tail is often tufted. Jerboas’ dense fur is either silky or velvety in texture and light in colour, usually matching the ground of the animal’s habitat.
Jerboas leap up to 3 metres (10 feet) at a bound when alarmed or traveling swiftly, but when moving slowly they walk on their hind legs and sometimes hop by using all four limbs. The long tail props up the animal when it stands and is used for balance when it springs away. By day jerboas rest in burrows; they emerge at night to forage for seeds, succulent parts of plants, and insects. Some species plug their burrow entrances with soil to retain moisture and keep hot air out. Most are dormant during winter. Although jerboas drink water in captivity, in natural habitats they obtain it from food.
