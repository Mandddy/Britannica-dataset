Ang Lee,  (born October 23, 1954, P’ing-tung county, Taiwan) Taiwan-born film director who transitioned from directing Chinese films to major English-language productions.
After high school Lee enrolled in the Taiwan Academy of Art, where he became interested in acting. In 1978 he moved to the United States to study theatre at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and cinema at New York University, where his master’s project, Fine Line, received best film and best director awards. After graduating in 1984, Lee spent the next six years unsuccessfully pitching ideas to Hollywood studio executives. Frustrated and depressed by the stagnancy of his film career in the United States, he entered two scripts in a screenplay contest in Taiwan (Republic of China) and placed first and second. This honour inspired two independent film production companies to fund and produce his movies.
