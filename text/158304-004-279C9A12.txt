Maurice Béjart, pseudonym of Maurice-Jean Berger  (born January 1, 1927, Marseille, France—died November 22, 2007, Lausanne, Switzerland) French-born dancer, choreographer, and opera director known for combining classic ballet and modern dance with jazz, acrobatics, and musique concrète (electronic music based on natural sounds).
After studies in Paris, Béjart toured with the Ballets de Paris de Roland Petit (1947–49), the International Ballet (1949–50), and the Royal Swedish Ballet (1951–52). In 1954 he founded Les Ballets de l’Étoile (later Ballet Théâtre de Maurice Béjart), for which he choreographed his masterwork, Symphonie pour un homme seul. His other ballets include Voilà l’homme, Promethée, and Sonate à trois. In 1960, following his successful ballet version of Igor Stravinsky’s masterpiece Le Sacre du printemps (1959), he became director of ballet at Brussels’ Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie. The same year he became artistic director of the Ballet du XXe Siècle (Ballet of the Twentieth Century), which became one of the foremost dance companies in the world. In 1987 the troupe moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, and was renamed Béjart Ballet Lausanne. Béjart’s productions with the Twentieth Century troupe were notable for their flamboyant theatricality and their innovative reworking of traditional music and dance materials, often in an unusual and controversial fashion.
