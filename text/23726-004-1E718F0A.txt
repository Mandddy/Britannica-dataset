Samuel Chase,  (born April 17, 1741, Princess Anne, Md. [U.S.]—died June 19, 1811, Washington, D.C., U.S.) associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, whose acquittal in an impeachment trial (1805) inspired by Pres. Thomas Jefferson for political reasons strengthened the independence of the judiciary.
Chase served as a member of the Maryland assembly (1764–84) and in the Continental Congress (1774–78, 1784–85). As a member of the latter, he signed the Declaration of Independence. He went on to serve as a judge of the Baltimore criminal court and then as chief judge of the Maryland General Court from 1791 to 1796, when Pres. George Washington appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court. In Ware v. Hylton (1796), an important early test of nationalism, he upheld the primacy of U.S. treaties over state statutes. In Calder v. Bull (1798), he asserted that legislative power over liberty and property is limited by “certain vital principles in our free Republican governments”; later courts read these principles into the “due process of law” clauses of the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.
