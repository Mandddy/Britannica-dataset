Wired, American magazine, covering technology and its effects on society, founded in San Francisco in 1993.
In the early 1990s the American journalist Louis Rossetto and his partner, Jane Metcalfe, settled in San Francisco with the intent of establishing a magazine devoted to cutting-edge technology. They launched Wired in 1993 as a bimonthly publication featuring articles written by leading authors, journalists, and thinkers. Arriving as the culture of the Internet was on the verge of becoming mainstream, the magazine captured a zeitgeist, and its forward-looking articles, along with a busy and colourful design, captured readersâ€™ attention. In less than one year, Wired began publishing monthly.
