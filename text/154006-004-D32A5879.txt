University of Virginia, public, coeducational institution of higher learning in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S., on a campus of 1,000 acres (405 hectares) near the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Founded by Thomas Jefferson, it was chartered in 1819. Jefferson was aided by Joseph C. Cabell (1778–1856), a member of the Virginia Senate and the school’s chief fund-raiser. The school elected Jefferson its first rector of the board of visitors (the governing body). James Madison and James Monroe were other U.S. presidents who served on the university’s board.
Jefferson laid out the campus of his “academical village,” designed its buildings, supervised the construction of the Rotunda (which he designed based on the Pantheon in Rome), planned the curriculum, and selected the faculty. The school opened in 1825 with a faculty of eight. Jefferson introduced an elective system of study and opposed the granting of degrees as “artificial embellishments.” By the time of the American Civil War, the university was second only to Harvard in size of faculty and student body. It was essentially a graduate school until the bachelor of science degree was offered in 1868, and in 1899 the bachelor’s degree became the primary degree offered. (The university had approved a master of arts degree in 1831, the primary degree in the 19th century; the M.D. was first awarded in 1828 and a degree in law in 1842.)
