Ricky Gervais,  (born June 25, 1961, Reading, Berkshire, England) English comedian, perhaps best known for his work on the television series The Office (2001–03).
After completing his studies in philosophy at the University of London, Gervais fronted the little-known band Seona Dancing, which scored a minor hit in the Philippines in 1985 with the song “More to Lose.” In 1996 he joined a new radio station, XFM, where he hosted a program and met Stephen Merchant, who became a frequent collaborator. During the 1990s Gervais contributed comedy sketches to the BBC TV shows Bruiser and Golden Years, in which he also appeared. He began a regular role on the The 11 O’Clock Show and in 2000 briefly hosted his own talk show, Meet Ricky Gervais.
