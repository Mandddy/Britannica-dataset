Emma Lazarus,  (born July 22, 1849, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Nov. 19, 1887, New York City) American poet and essayist best known for her sonnet “The New Colossus,” written to the Statue of Liberty.
Born into a cultured family of Sephardic (Spanish Jewish) stock, Lazarus learned languages and the classics at an early age. She early displayed a talent for poetry, and her first book, Poems and Translations (1867), was praised by Ralph Waldo Emerson. She dedicated her next book, Admetus and Other Poems (1871), to him. These and subsequent volumes—the prose Alide: An Episode of Goethe’s Life (1874), a verse tragedy, The Spagnoletto (1876), and a fine translation of the Poems and Ballads of Heinrich Heine (1881)—were cosmopolitan in flavour, sometimes technically excellent, but lacking in real distinction.
