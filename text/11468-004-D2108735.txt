Albert-Alexandre Glatigny, in full Joseph-Albert-Alexandre Glatigny  (born May 21, 1839, Lillebonne, France—died April 16, 1873, Sèvres) French poet of the Parnassian school, known for his small poems of satiric comment and for his peripatetic life as a strolling actor and improvisationalist.
A poor boy apprenticed to a printer, Glatigny wrote a historical drama at 16 and a year later ran off to join a traveling theatre company. While he was on the road the barbed language of Théodore de Banville’s Odes funambulesques (“Fantastic Odes”) inspired him to write his first book of poems, Les Vignes folles (1860; “The Mad Vines”). Later collections included Les Flèches d’or (1864; “The Golden Barbs”) and Gilles et Pasquins (1872).
