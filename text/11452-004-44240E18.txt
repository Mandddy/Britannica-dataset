Gnu (genus Connochaetes), also called wildebeest,  either of two species of large African antelopes of the family Bovidae in the tribe Alcelaphini. They are among the most specialized and successful of African herbivores and are dominant in plains ecosystems.
The common wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) is a keystone species in plains and acacia savanna ecosystems from southeastern Africa to central Kenya. It is highly gregarious and superbly adapted for a migratory existence. C. taurinus has high shoulders sloping to lower hindquarters, a deep chest, a short neck, and thin legs. It is conspicuously coloured, its coat being slate gray to dark brown and reverse counter-shaded (that is, lighter above and darker below), with black vertical stripes on the forequarters as well as black markings on the forehead, mane, beard (white in two subspecies), and long tail. The horns, similar in both sexes, are cowlike.
