Alex Ovechkin, in full Aleksandr Mikhaylovich Ovechkin  (born September 17, 1985, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian ice hockey player who won the Hart Memorial Trophy three times (2008, 2009, and 2013) as the most valuable player in the National Hockey League (NHL).
Ovechkin’s mother was a two-time Olympic gold medalist (1976, 1980) as a member of the Soviet women’s national basketball team, and his father was a professional football (soccer) player. Ovechkin’s impressive athletic lineage was evident early in his life, as he played at the highest level of Russian professional hockey at age 16 and was the standout forward for the national junior hockey team by age 17. Ovechkin was selected by the Washington Capitals with the first overall pick of the 2004 NHL draft, but his rookie season was delayed a year by the labour lockout that led to the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season. He made his NHL debut in 2005 alongside an even more highly touted rookie, Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, but Ovechkin’s 106 points in the 2005–06 season earned him the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year.
