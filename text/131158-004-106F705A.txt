House snake, any of several nonvenomous snake species that live in or around dwellings. In the United States this name is often given to the milk snake (see king snake).
The house snakes of Africa belong to the genus Lamprophis, family Colubridae, with about 14 species. They are nonvenomous mouse- and rat-catchers. An example is L. lineatus of eastern Africa, often found in eaves or under mats; it is blackish and usually less than 90 cm (35 inches) long. The brown house snake L. fuliginosus occurs throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Although adults prefer rodents—but also consume bats and other small mammals—the young prey on lizards. All Lamprophis species are egg layers.
