Fog drip, water that drips to the ground from trees and other objects wetted by drifting fog droplets. The needle-shaped leaves of conifers are efficient fog droplet collectors, and fog drip in mountainous regions may supply enough water to maintain forests. During the foggy but nearly rainless summers in California, fog drip may produce as much as one millimetre of precipitated water in a single night.
