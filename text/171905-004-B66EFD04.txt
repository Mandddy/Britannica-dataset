Theodor Plievier, pseudonym (until 1933) Theodor Plivier   (born February 12, 1892, Berlin, Germany—died March 12, 1955, Avegno, near Locarno, Switzerland) German war novelist who was one of the first native writers to begin examining Germany’s role in World War II and assessing the national guilt.
Plievier was the son of a labourer, and he left home at the age of 17. He led a vagrant life until serving in the German Navy in World War I, during which time he participated in the 1918 naval mutiny. Plievier worked as a left-wing publicist during the 1920s. He described his war experiences in Des Kaisers Kulis (1930; The Kaiser’s Coolies), Zwölf Mann und ein Kapitän (1930; “Twelve Men and a Captain”), Der Kaiser ging, die Generäle blieben (1932; The Kaiser Goes, the Generals Remain), Der 10. November 1918 (1935; “The 10th of November 1918”), and Das grosse Abenteuer (1936; “The Great Adventure”). The Nazi Party banned his books in 1933—the same year that he fled to Moscow—and revoked his citizenship in 1934. He returned to the Soviet Zone in 1945 but left for the West in 1947.
