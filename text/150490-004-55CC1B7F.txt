Balfour Biological Laboratory, in full Balfour Biological Laboratory for Women,  institution for women’s biological instruction (1884–1914) at the University of Cambridge, England. The facility—one of the first in Britain tailored specifically to women’s formal laboratory instruction—was established to assist the students of Cambridge’s Newnham and Girton women’s colleges in their preparation for the university’s Natural Sciences Tripos, which was opened to women in 1881 (along with all other tripos examinations at the university).
In the 1860s and ’70s women seeking higher education in the natural sciences attended lectures at the men’s colleges at Cambridge. At that time Cambridge physiologist Michael Foster became known for his revolutionary teaching methods, in which lectures were followed by laboratory training, and his colleague zoologist and embryologist Francis Maitland Balfour offered courses in animal morphology and embryology that also incorporated laboratory demonstration. When enrollment in Foster’s and Balfour’s classes swelled, officials at Newnham and Girton proposed the establishment of a separate women’s laboratory training facility. Both men, who served as advisers for the women’s colleges, supported the decision.
