Iguaçu Falls, also spelled Iguassú, Spanish Cataratas del Iguazú, Portuguese Cataratas do Iguaçu, or Saltos do Iguaçu ,  series of cataracts on the Iguaçu River, 14 miles (23 km) above its confluence with the Alto (Upper) Paraná River, at the Argentina-Brazil border. The falls resemble an elongated horseshoe that extends for 1.7 miles (2.7 km)—nearly three times wider than Niagara Falls in North America and significantly greater than the width of Victoria Falls in Africa. Numerous rocky and wooded islands on the edge of the escarpment over which the Iguaçu River plunges divide the falls into some 275 separate waterfalls or cataracts, varying between 200 and 269 feet (60 and 82 metres) in height. The name of the falls, like that of the river, is derived from a Guaraní word meaning “great water.”
The rate of flow of the falls may rise to a maximum of 450,000 cubic feet (12,750 cubic metres) per second during the rainy season from November to March. Minimum flow occurs during the dry season from August to October. The mean annual rate of flow is about 62,000 cubic feet (1,756 cubic metres) per second.
