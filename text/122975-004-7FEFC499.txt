Cipriano Castro,  (born Oct. 12, 1858, Capacho, Táchira, Venez.—died Dec. 4, 1924, San Juan, P.R.) Venezuelan soldier and dictator, called the Lion of the Andes, who was the first man from the mountains to rule a nation that until the 20th century had been dominated by plainsmen and city dwellers from Caracas. He ruled for nine remarkably corrupt years (1899–1908), embezzling vast sums of money and living as an extraordinary libertine, only to be deposed by his more ruthless lieutenant, Juan Vicente Gómez.
Castro worked as a cowboy in the Andean region. Enlisting the support of a powerful Venezuelan general, he entered politics and became the governor of his province of Táchira but was exiled to Colombia when the government in Caracas was overthrown in 1892. He lived in Colombia for seven years, amassing a fortune in illegal cattle trading and recruiting a private army, with which he successfully attacked Caracas in 1899. Installed as the supreme military commander and later as president of Venezuela, Castro inaugurated a period of plunder and political disorder.
