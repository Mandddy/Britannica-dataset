Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre,  (born Sept. 19, 1749, Amiens, Fr.—died  Aug. 19, 1822, Paris) French astronomer who prepared tables that plot the location of Uranus.
In 1771 Delambre became tutor to the son of M. d’Assy, receiver general of finances. In 1788 d’Assy built an observatory for Delambre’s use. There he observed and computed almost uninterruptedly and in 1792 published Tables du Soleil, de Jupiter, de Saturne, d’Uranus et des satellites de Jupiter (“Tables of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Jupiter’s Satellites”). He was admitted to the Institut de France upon its organization in 1795 and became, in 1803, perpetual secretary to its mathematical section. He served from 1795 on the bureau of longitudes. From 1792 to 1799 he was occupied with the measurement of the arc of the meridian extending from Dunkirk, Fr., to Barcelona, and published a detailed account of the operations in Base du système métrique (3 vol., 1806, 1807, 1810; “Basis of the Metric System”). In 1807 he became professor of astronomy at the Collège de France in Paris and was treasurer to the Imperial University from 1808 until its suppression in 1815. Delambre also wrote histories of ancient, medieval, and modern astronomy. His Tables écliptiques des satellites de Jupiter (“Ecliptic Tables of Jupiter’s Satellites”) was republished by the bureau of longitudes in 1817. A large crater on the Moon is named in his honour.
