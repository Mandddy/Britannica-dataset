London 1908 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in London that took place April 27–Oct. 31, 1908. The London Games were the fourth occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
The 1908 Olympic Games originally were scheduled for Rome, but, with Italy beset by organizational and financial obstacles, it was decided that the Games should be moved to London. The London Games were the first to be organized by the various sporting bodies concerned and the first to have an opening ceremony. The parade of athletes, like the Games, was marred by politics and controversy. The Finnish team protested Russian rule in Finland. Many Irish athletes refused to compete as subjects of the British crown and were absent from the Games, and a running feud between the Americans and the British began when the American shot-putter Ralph Rose would not dip the U.S. flag in salute to King Edward VII. This refusal later became standard practice for U.S. athletes in the opening parade. (See Sidebar: Ralph Rose and Martin Sheridan: The Battle of Shepherd’s Bush.)
