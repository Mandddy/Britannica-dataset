Trumpetfish (genus Aulostomus), any of the three species of marine fishes that constitute the family Aulostomidae (order Gasterosteiformes), found on coral reefs and reef flats in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and western Pacific oceans. Trumpetfishes have elongated bodies and stiff tubelike snouts ending in small jaws. The upper jaw lacks teeth; however, the lower jaw and vomer (palate) have minute teeth. The body is covered with small scales, the back bears a row of spines that can be raised in defense, and the chin is endowed with a short barbel. Trumpetfishes can reach a maximum length of about 80 cm (31 inches).
Trumpetfishes are common reef predators that feed on small fishes and crustaceans. They often conceal themselves by floating in a vertical head-down position among certain corals (gorgonians). They have also been noted to swim beside larger fishes, possibly to ambush prey, to obtain protection, or to move from one place to another. Species include the Atlantic trumpetfish (Aulostomus maculatus), the Atlantic cornetfish (A. strigosus), and the Chinese trumpetfish (A. chinensis).
