Basilisk (genus Basiliscus), any of four species of forest lizards of tropical North and South America belonging to the family Iguanidae. The name is applied because of a resemblance to the legendary monster called basilisk (see cockatrice). The body is slender and compressed from side to side, the tail is long and whiplike, and the rear of the head is extended into a flat lobe like a cock’s comb. Males have a crest along the back, and this crest runs the length of the body in two species.
Basilisks commonly live along streams and will run quickly across the water on their hind legs when frightened. They are commonly called “Jesus Christ” lizards because of this trait. The animal’s speed, light weight, and possession of broadscale fringes on the toes keep it from sinking into the water during a sprint; however, it is usually the younger and lighter lizards that are seen running across the surface of the water. Basilisks are also good swimmers, and adults may remain underwater up to 30 minutes before resurfacing.
