George W. Julian, in full George Washington Julian   (born May 5, 1817, Wayne County, Indiana, U.S.â€”died  July 7, 1899, Irvington, Indiana) American reform politician who began as an abolitionist, served in Congress as a Radical Republican during the American Civil War and Reconstruction eras, and later championed woman suffrage and other liberal measures.
After a public school education and a brief stint as a teacher, Julian studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1840 and thereafter practiced in several Indiana towns. By the mid-1840s Julian was a Whig member of the Indiana state legislature and a frequent author of antislavery newspaper articles. His abolitionist views prompted him to switch to the Free Soil Party, and in 1848 he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, running on the Free Soil ticket.
