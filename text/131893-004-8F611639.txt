Gelechiid moth (family Gelechiidae), any of more than 4,500 species of moths (order Lepidoptera), some of which are important pests. The brown adults have gray or silver markings and average 19 mm (3/4 inch) in wingspan. The hindwings have somewhat concave outer margins and pointed tips, in contrast with the more typical, narrow forewings.
The larval habits of gelechiid moths vary. Larvae may mine or bore in plants, spin webs, form galls, or roll leaves. They are pale and naked and pupate within silken cocoons.
