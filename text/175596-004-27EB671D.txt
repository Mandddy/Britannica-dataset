It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, American screwball comedy film, released in 1963, that featured an all-star cast of comedic actors directed by Stanley Kramer, who was known primarily for his dramas dealing with controversial topics.
The dying words of a career thief (played by Jimmy Durante) to a group of disparate strangers set off a madcap race to find his loot, which is supposedly hidden under a “big W” somewhere in a California park. Ethel Merman, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Mickey Rooney, and Peter Falk are among those who portrayed the treasure hunters. Spencer Tracy was cast as a police detective.
