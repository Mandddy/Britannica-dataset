Extending 76 metres (249 feet) high and 6,534 metres (21,432 feet) long, it is one of the worldâ€™s largest earthfill dams. Fort Peck Lake, which the dam impounds, is the fifth largest man-made reservoir in the United States; it extends 216 km (134 miles). The entire Fort Peck system is contained within the Charles M.
