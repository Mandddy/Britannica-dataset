Soil liquefaction, also called earthquake liquefaction,  ground failure or loss of strength that causes otherwise solid soil to behave temporarily as a viscous liquid. The phenomenon occurs in water-saturated unconsolidated soils affected by seismic S waves (secondary waves), which cause ground vibrations during earthquakes. Although earthquake shock is the best known cause of liquefaction, certain construction practices, including blasting and soil compaction and vibroflotation (which uses a vibrating probe to change the grain structure of the surrounding soil), produce this phenomenon intentionally. Poorly drained fine-grained soils such as sandy, silty, and gravelly soils are the most susceptible to liquefaction.
Granular soils are made up of a mix of soil and pore spaces. When earthquake shock occurs in waterlogged soils, the water-filled pore spaces collapse, which decreases the overall volume of the soil. This process increases the water pressure between individual soil grains, and the grains can then move freely in the watery matrix. This substantially lowers the soilâ€™s resistance to shear stress and causes the mass of soil to take on the characteristics of a liquid. In its liquefied state, soil deforms easily, and heavy objects such as structures can be damaged from the sudden loss of support from below.
