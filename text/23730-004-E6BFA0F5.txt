Charles Albert, Italian Carlo Alberto   (born Oct. 2, 1798, Turin, Piedmont, French Republic—died  July 28, 1849, Oporto, Port.) king of Sardinia–Piedmont (1831–49) during the turbulent period of the Risorgimento, the movement for the unification of Italy. His political vacillations make him an enigmatic personality.
Exiled from Italy, Charles Albert, who belonged to a collateral branch of the House of Savoy, was brought up in Paris and Geneva, where he was exposed to the ideas of the French Revolution. Succeeding his father as prince of Carignano in 1800, he was named count by Napoleon in 1810. When his cousin Victor Emmanuel I was restored to the throne of Piedmont, Charles Albert returned to Milan, where the young liberals sought his aid in persuading the King to grant a popular constitution. After the revolution in Naples (1820), a plot against the King materialized. After consenting on March 6, 1821, to lead it, Charles Albert the next day refused to participate directly in the conspiracy. The coup erupted on March 10, Victor Emmanuel abdicated on the 13th, and Charles Albert was appointed regent until the arrival of the new king, Charles Felix. Charles Albert promptly promulgated a liberal constitution, which was, however, annulled by Charles Felix, who arrested the Regent and quelled the rebellion. Charles Albert then fought with the French to reinforce the monarchy in Spain (1823).
