Safety glass, type of glass that, when struck, bulges or breaks into tiny, relatively harmless fragments rather than shattering into large, jagged pieces. Safety glass may be made in either of two ways. It may be constructed by laminating two sheets of ordinary glass together, with a thin interlayer of plastic, or it may be produced by strengthening glass sheets by heat treatment.
In 1909 the first successful patent for safety glass was taken out in France by an artist and chemist, Édouard Bénédictus, who used a sheet of celluloid bonded between two pieces of glass. Other plastics were also tried, but in 1936 polyvinyl butyral (PVB) was found to possess so many safety-desirable properties that its use became universal. Bulletproof glass is usually built up using several glass and plastic components.
