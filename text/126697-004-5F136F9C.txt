University of Edinburgh, coeducational, privately controlled institution of higher education at Edinburgh, one of the most noted of Scotland’s universities. It was founded in 1583 as “the Town’s College” under Presbyterian auspices by the Edinburgh town council under a charter granted in 1582 by King James VI, who later became King James I of England. In 1621 an act of the Scottish Parliament accorded all the rights and privileges of Scotland’s three older universities to the Town’s College, after which it gradually assumed the name of the University of Edinburgh. The university remained under the control of the Edinburgh town council until 1858, when it received autonomy under the Universities Act.
The university initially consisted of a liberal arts college and a school of divinity. Schools of medicine and law were established in the early 18th century, and faculties of music, science, arts, social sciences, and veterinary medicine were subsequently added.
