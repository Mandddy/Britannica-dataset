Darkling beetle (family Tenebrionidae), any of approximately 20,000 species of insects in the order Coleoptera so named because of their nocturnal habits. These beetles tend to be short and dark; some, however, have bright markings. Although found on every continent, they are more common in warm, dry climates. Most members feed on dry, decomposing vegetation or animal tissue. Some bore in wood; others feed on larvae or live in ant nests.
Adult darkling beetles vary greatly in size and shape: from 2 to 35 mm (1/12 to about 1 1/2 inches) and from flat to cylindrical. The larvae are about 25 mm (1 inch) long, cylindrical, and wormlike.
