Carl Reiner,  (born March 20, 1922, Bronx, New York, U.S.) American actor, writer, and director who found success in both television and film. After creating the landmark TV series The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961–66), he directed such popular comedies as Oh, God! (1977) and The Jerk (1979), one of several films that he made with Steve Martin.
Reiner studied acting as a teenager and later performed with a touring theatre company. After serving in an entertainment unit during World War II, he made his Broadway debut in the musical Inside U.S.A. (1948–49). During that time he also began acting on television. In 1953–54 Reiner was a regular performer on the popular television comedy series Your Show of Shows, which starred Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. After the show ended, Reiner went to work on Caesar’s Hour (1954–57), a sketch comedy program. In addition to acting on the show, for which he won two Emmy Awards, he served as a writer. Reiner then was involved with a variety of projects, including a comedy routine called “The 2000 Year Old Man,” in which he interviewed Mel Brooks, who played the title character. The routine was later the basis for a number of successful recordings—one of which, The 2000 Year Old Man in the Year 2000 (1997), earned a Grammy Award—as well as for a 1975 TV special.
