Buddy Guy, original name George Guy  (born July 30, 1936, Lettsworth, Louisiana, U.S.) American blues musician noted for his slashing electric guitar riffs and passionate vocals.
Guy made his own guitar at age 13 and taught himself to play by trying to reproduce the sounds of bluesmen such as John Lee Hooker that he heard on the radio. He started playing clubs in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while still a teenager and in 1957 went on to Chicago. There he was discovered by blues great Muddy Waters, who helped him find work at the 708 Club, where he met other legendary bluesmen, including B.B. King and Willie Dixon. In 1960–67 he recorded several hits for the Chess label, including “Leave My Girl Alone” and “Stone Crazy.” He also worked as a sideman for such artists as Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, and Koko Taylor.
