Meteor shower, temporary rise in the rate of meteor sightings, caused by the entry into Earth’s atmosphere of a number of meteoroids (see meteor and meteoroid) at approximately the same place in the sky and the same time of year, traveling in parallel paths and apparently having a common origin. Most meteor showers are known or believed to be associated with active or defunct comets; they represent Earth’s passage through the orbits of these comets and its collision with the streams of debris (typically of sand-grain to pebble size) that have been left behind. The showers return annually, but, because the densities of meteoroids in the streams (commonly called meteor streams) are not uniform, the intensities of the showers can vary considerably from year to year.
A meteor shower’s name is usually derived from that of the constellation (or of a star therein) in which the shower’s radiant is situated—i.e., the point in the sky from which perspective makes the parallel meteor tracks seem to originate. Some showers have been named for an associated comet; e.g., the Andromedids were formerly called the Bielids, after Biela’s Comet. The Cyrillid shower of 1913 had no radiant (the meteoroids seemed to enter the atmosphere from a circular orbit around Earth) and was named for St. Cyril of Alexandria, on whose feast day (formerly celebrated on February 9) the shower was observed. The great Leonid meteor shower of Nov. 12, 1833, in which hundreds of thousands of meteors were observed in one night, was seen all over North America and initiated the first serious study of meteor showers (see meteoritics). It was later established that very strong Leonid showers recur at 33–34-year intervals (the orbital period of its associated comet, Tempel-Tuttle), and occasional records of its appearances have been traced back to about ad 902. Since about 1945, radar observations have revealed meteor showers regularly occurring in the daylight sky, where they are invisible to the eye.
