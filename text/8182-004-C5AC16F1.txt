The Lhasa apso is characteristically hardy, intelligent, and watchful. Longer than it is tall, it stands 10 to 11 inches&nbsp;(25 to 28 cm) and weighs 13 to 15 pounds (6 to 7 kg). It has a heavily haired tail that curls over its back and a long, profuse coat that covers its eyes. The coat of the Lhasa apso may be of various colours, but golden-brown shades are preferred by most breeders.
