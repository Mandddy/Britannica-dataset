Ball bearing,  one of the two members of the class of rolling, or so-called antifriction, bearings (the other member of the class is the roller bearing). The function of a ball bearing is to connect two machine members that move relative to one another in such a manner that the frictional resistance to motion is minimal. In many applications one of the members is a rotating shaft and the other a fixed housing.
There are three main parts in a ball bearing: two grooved, ringlike races, or tracks, and a number of hardened steel balls. The races are of the same width but different diameters; the smaller one, fitting inside the larger one and having a groove on its outside surface, is attached on its inside surface to one of the machine members. The larger race has a groove on its inside surface and is attached on its outside surface to the other machine member. The balls fill the space between the two races and roll with negligible friction in the grooves. The balls are loosely restrained and separated by means of a retainer or cage.
