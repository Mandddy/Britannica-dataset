Arti, (
        Hindi: “the ceremony of lights”)  Sanskrit aratrika,  in Hindu and Jain rites, the waving of lighted lamps before an image of a god or a person to be honoured. In performing the rite, the worshiper circles the lamp three times in a clockwise direction while chanting a prayer or singing a hymn. Arti is one of the most frequently observed parts of both temple and private worship(see puja). The god is honoured by the lighted ghee (clarified butter) or camphor and is protected by the invocation of the deities of the directions of the compass. In Indian households, arti is a commonly observed ritual treatment accorded specially honoured guests. It is also a part of many domestic ceremonies.
