The School for Scandal, comedy in five acts by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, performed in 1777 and published in 1780. With its spirited ridicule of affectation and pretentiousness, it is one of the greatest comedies of manners in English.
Charles Surface is an extravagant but good-hearted young man. His brother Joseph, supposedly more respectable and worthy, is shown to be a conniving schemer who courts Lady Teazle, the young wife of a wealthy old nobleman. Sir Oliver Surface, their uncle, disguises himself to discover which of his nephews shall be his heir. Joseph is exposed as a hypocrite, and Charles triumphs, winning both fortune and true love.
