Kinase, an enzyme that adds phosphate groups (PO43−) to other molecules. A large number of kinases exist—the human genome contains at least 500 kinase-encoding genes. Included among these enzymes’ targets for phosphate group addition (phosphorylation) are proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.
For protein targets, kinases can phosphorylate the amino acids serine, threonine, and tyrosine. The reversible phosphorylation of proteins, by the antagonistic (opposing) action of kinases and phosphatases, is an important component of cell signaling because the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states of the target protein can have different levels of activity. Edwin Gerhard Krebs and Edmond H. Fischer received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for their work in establishing this paradigm.
