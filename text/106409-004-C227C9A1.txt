Dorset, administrative, geographic, and historic county of southwestern England. It is bordered by the English Channel (south) and the counties of Devon (west), Hampshire (east), and Somerset and Wiltshire (both north). The historic town of Dorchester, in the south, is the county seat.
The administrative, geographic, and historic counties cover somewhat different areas. The administrative county comprises six districts: the borough of Christchurch, East Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset, and the borough of Weymouth and Portland. The geographic county encompasses those districts as well as the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole. The historic county excludes Bournemouth, Christchurch, and part of East Dorset, which instead belong to the historic county of Hampshire. Along its western border the administrative county has gained small areas of the historic counties of Devon and Somerset through boundary adjustments, while a small section of the historic county of Dorset lies in the administrative county of Somerset.
