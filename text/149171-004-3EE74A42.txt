Wigtownshire, also called Wigtown,  historic county at the southwestern tip of Scotland, facing the Irish Sea to the south and the North Channel to the west. It is the western portion of the historic region of Galloway and lies entirely within the Dumfries and Galloway council area.
Hill forts and lake dwellings (crannogs) dating from the Iron Age abound in the area. Around the 6th century Wigtownshire was part of the Celtic British kingdom of Strathclyde when the area was invaded by Anglo-Saxons from the neighbouring kingdom of Northumbria and by Scots from Ireland—just 13 miles (21 km) away across the North Channel. During the 9th century Norse invaders and settlers established hegemony in the area. With the Norse conquest Wigtown became part of Galloway, a district that was ruled by Scots-Norse kings and that covered most of southwestern Scotland. In the 1120s Fergus, the ruler of Galloway, reconstituted the area’s Anglian bishopric, which was first established in the 8th century, and he built a priory at Whithorn as the bishopric’s cathedral. The lands of Fergus’s descendants eventually passed by marriage to the Balliol family and then to the Douglases, who purchased the earldom of Wigtown about 1372. Under that family the region, which had long been entitled to its own code of laws, came under the general law of Scotland in 1426. After the fall of the Douglases in 1455, the Kennedy family dominated Wigtown. The region still has many castles dating from the 1470s to the early 17th century. The Industrial Revolution largely bypassed the county, which has remained overwhelmingly pastoral, but a tourist industry developed during the 20th century.
