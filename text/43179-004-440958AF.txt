Kapalika and Kalamukha, members of either of two groups of Shaivite (devotees of Shiva) ascetics, most prominent in India from the 8th through the 13th century, who became notorious for their practices of esoteric rituals that allegedly included both animal and human sacrifice, though there is no evidence for the latter. They were successors of the Pashupatas, one of the earliest sects.
The Kapalikas (worshippers of Kapalin, the skull bearer, a name of Shiva) and the Kalamukhas (“Black-Faced,” so called because of the black mark, or tilak, customarily worn on their foreheads) were often conflated or mistaken for one another. Both were designated as mahavratins (“observers of the great vows”), referring to a 12-year vow of rigorous self-abnegation that was purported to follow the sacrifice of a Brahman or other high-ranking person. The Kapalikas performed their vow in imitation of Shiva’s act of severing one of Brahma’s five heads, which stuck to Shiva’s hand until he entered the city of Varanasi, where the skull fell to the ground at a spot therefore called Kapala-mochana (“The Releasing of the Skull”). Kapala-mochana was subsequently the site of a great temple. During the period of that vow, ascetics ate and drank from a skull (alleged to be that of the person they had sacrificed) and followed practices such as going naked, eating the flesh of the dead, smearing themselves with the ashes of corpses, and frequenting cremation grounds. Other Hindus, Shaivites in particular, were enraged by such practices.
