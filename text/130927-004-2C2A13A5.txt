Carl Albert, in full Carl Bert Albert  (born May 10, 1908, McAlester, Okla., U.S.—died Feb. 4, 2000, McAlester) American politician who served as a representative from Oklahoma (1947–77) in the U.S. House of Representatives and as speaker of the House (1971–76). Because of his short stature (5 feet 4 inches [1.62 metres]) and the area of Oklahoma he represented, he was nicknamed the “Little Giant from Little Dixie.”
Albert was the son of Ernest Albert, a poor coal miner and cotton farmer from southeastern Oklahoma. He received his early education in a two-room school but went on to work his way through the University of Oklahoma at Norman, where he graduated with a degree in political science in 1931. He studied law at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship and graduated in 1934. After practicing as a lawyer and serving in the United States Army (1941–46) during World War II, Albert won election as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives. He became the Democratic whip in 1955 and speaker of the House in 1971.
