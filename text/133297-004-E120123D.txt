Ironwood Forest National Monument, ecologically rich region of the Sonoran Desert, southern Arizona, U.S., about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Tucson. It was established in 2000 and covers approximately 200 square miles (520 square km), encompassing portions of the Sawtooth, Waterman, Silver Bell, and Roskruge mountains. Saguaro National Park is just east, and the Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation forms much of the southern and western boundaries.
The monument preserves a significant stand of desert ironwood trees (Olneya tesota), a species endemic to the Sonoran Desert. The ironwood was named for the extreme density of its wood; it can reach 45 feet (14 metres) in height and live for more than 800 years. It serves as a “nurse plant,” providing forage and nesting sites for animals and protection from sun and frost to cactus and other plants growing beneath it. Native human inhabitants of the desert also used it for food and medicine.
