Corbett National Park, also called Jim Corbett National Park,  natural area in southern Uttarakhand state, northern India. It was established as Hailey National Park in 1936 and was first renamed Ramganga in the mid-1950s, before the name was changed to Corbett later that decade in memory of Jim Corbett, a well-known British sportsman and writer. The park itself occupies an area of 201 square miles (521 square km). It is part of the larger Corbett Tiger Reserve, which includes adjacent protected areas and has a total area of 497 square miles (1,288 square km). It is India’s oldest national park.
The park is located in the foothills of the Himalayas—about 35 miles (50 km) northwest of Ramnagar, the park headquarters—and lies at elevations ranging from some 1,260 to 3,610 feet (385 to 1,100 metres). It mainly occupies the broad Patlidoon Valley, through which the Ramganga River flows in a westerly direction. The river was dammed at the western end of the park to form a large reservoir in the centre of the reserve area and along the western side of the park that is used for sport fishing. The forest cover includes species of sal (Shorea), teak, oak, silver fir, spruce, cypress, birch, and bamboo. A reed forest was planted to afford natural cover for the park’s animals.
