Jean Lannes, duc de Montebello,  (born April 10/11, 1769, Lectoure, France—died May 31, 1809, Vienna, Austrian Empire) French general who, despite his humble origins, rose to the rank of marshal of the First Empire. Napoleon said of him, “I found him a pygmy and left him a giant.”
Lannes, the son of a stable boy, learned to read and write from a village priest and was apprenticed to a dyer. In 1792 he joined the national volunteers of Gers and, as a sergeant major, served in the Army of the Pyrénées-Orientales against the Spanish. His great courage in the Battle of Dego (1796), in the Italian campaign, brought him to the attention of Napoleon, who made him a general in 1796. In 1798–99 he took part in the capture of Cairo and went on the Syrian campaign as commander of an army division, playing a leading role in the siege of Gaza and Saint-Jean d’Acre, though he was seriously wounded at the Battle of Aboukir. Returning to France, he took command of the 9th and 10th Divisions. He took part in the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire, year VIII (November 9, 1799), which brought Napoleon to power. Entrusted with the vanguard that crossed the Alps into Italy in May 1800, he defeated the Austrians at Montebello on June 9, thus contributing greatly to Napoleon’s victory at Marengo five days later.
