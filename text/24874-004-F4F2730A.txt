Isaac Israel Hayes,  (born March 5, 1832, Chester county, Pa., U.S.—died  Dec. 17, 1881, New York, N.Y.) American physician and Arctic explorer who sought to prove the existence of open seas around the North Pole.
After receiving his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania (1853), Hayes volunteered to serve as surgeon with Elisha Kent Kane’s Arctic expedition, which planned to search for Sir John Franklin, the English explorer whose ships were lost in the Canadian Arctic in 1845. On May 31, 1853, Kane’s expedition sailed from New York City on the Advance. It spent the following winter icebound in Kane Basin off northwestern Greenland. During this time Hayes made several expeditions to nearby Ellesmere Island in the Canadian North, where in May 1854 he explored the region known as Grinnell Land. His attempt to reach the west coast of Greenland at Upernavik (August 1854) became the subject of his book, An Arctic Boat Journey (1860).
