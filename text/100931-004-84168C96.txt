Sakamoto Ryōma, original name Sakamoto Naonari   (born Jan. 3, 1836, Kōchi, Japan—died  Dec. 10, 1867, Kyōto) noted imperial loyalist whose effort to forge the Satsuma-Chōshū Alliance (1866) between those two large feudal domains, or hans, was critical in setting the stage for the Meiji Restoration (1868).
Descendant of a low-ranking samurai family, Sakamoto early established a reputation for swordsmanship. The contacts he made through his sword fighting served him in good stead when, influenced by imperial ideology, he began to plot against the Tokugawa shogunate for a restoration of power to the emperor.
