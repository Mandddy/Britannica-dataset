Bearded seal,  (Erignathus barbatus), nonmigratory seal of the family Phocidae, distinguished by the bushy, bristly whiskers for which it is named; it is also known as “squareflipper” after the rectangular shape of the foreflipper. Highly valued by Eskimos for its hide, meat, and blubber, the bearded seal is a grayish or yellow-brown animal that lives alone or in small groups in coastal Arctic waters. It attains a length of about 2.4–3.7 m (8–12 feet) and a weight of about 225–454 kg (500–1,000 pounds); the female is somewhat smaller than the male. An adept diver, the bearded seal feeds mainly on clams and other bottom animals, possibly using its whiskers to scrape for prey. The female breeds every other year, bearing a single dark-gray pup after about 11 months’ gestation.
