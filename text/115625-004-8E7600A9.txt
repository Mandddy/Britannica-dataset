Meuse River, Latin Mosa, Flemish Maes, Dutch Maas,  river, rising at Pouilly on the Langres Plateau in France and flowing generally northward for 590 miles (950 km) through Belgium and the Netherlands to the North Sea. In the French part, the river has cut a steep-sided, sometimes deep valley between Saint-Mihiel and Verdun, and beyond Charleville-Mézières it meanders through the Ardennes region in a narrow valley. Entering Belgium at Givet, it continues northward to Namur, where it is joined on the left (west) bank by the Sambre River and then turns eastward to Liège. The Meuse there forms a natural routeway for river transport and is the centre of industrial development. At Liège it is deep and narrow and lies about 450 feet (137 metres) below the plateau tops. The river turns north and, from Maastricht (Neth.) to Maaseik (Belg.), forms the frontier between the Netherlands and Belgium. From Venlo (Neth.) it curves gradually west, reaches sea level, and divides, one branch flowing into the Hollandsch Canal (an outlet of the North Sea) while another joins the Waal River (a channel of the Rhine) near Gorinchem to become the Merwede. Near Dordrecht the Merwede divides into the Noord to the north, which joins with the Lek River to become the Nieuwe Maas, and the Oude Maas to the south. The Nieuwe Maas and the Oude Maas come together at the Nieuwe Waterweg (New Waterway), which leads to the North Sea.
The Meuse River is navigable for most of its length and is one of the more important waterways of western Europe. In the vicinity of Maastricht, the Albert Canal extends northwestward from the Meuse to reach Antwerp, while the Juliana Canal parallels the Meuse’s course northward into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Meuse and its canals are heavily traveled by small cargo ships and barges.
