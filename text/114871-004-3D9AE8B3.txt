Henri Dunant, in full Jean-Henri Dunant  (born May 8, 1828, Geneva, Switzerland—died October 30, 1910, Heiden) Swiss humanitarian, founder of the Red Cross (now Red Cross and Red Crescent) and the World’s Young Men’s Christian Association. He was cowinner (with Frédéric Passy) of the first Nobel Prize for Peace in 1901.
An eyewitness of the Battle of Solferino (June 24, 1859), which resulted in nearly 40,000 casualties, Dunant organized emergency aid services for the Austrian and French wounded. In Un Souvenir de Solférino (1862; A Memory of Solferino), he proposed the formation in all countries of voluntary relief societies for the prevention and alleviation of suffering in war and peacetime, without distinction of race or creed; he also proposed an international agreement covering the war wounded. In 1863 he founded the International Committee for the Relief of the Wounded (now International Committee of the Red Cross), and the following year the first national societies and the first Geneva Convention came into being.
