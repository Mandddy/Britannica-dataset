Theodore Parker,  (born August 24, 1810, Lexington, Massachusetts, U.S.—died  May 10, 1860, Florence, Italy) American Unitarian theologian, pastor, scholar, and social reformer who was active in the antislavery movement. Theologically, he repudiated much traditional Christian dogma, putting in its place an intuitive knowledge of God derived from man’s experience of nature and insight into his own mind. Parker resembled Ralph Waldo Emerson and other New England Transcendentalists in his emphasis on intuition but differed in the way he tempered his romanticism with rationalist and scientific interest.
Although Parker passed the entrance examination for Harvard College in 1830, he had no funds to attend. He was allowed, however, to take the examinations for his course of study without enrolling and was granted an honorary degree. He then attended Harvard Divinity School, from which he graduated in 1836. The next year he was ordained pastor of the Unitarian Church in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.
