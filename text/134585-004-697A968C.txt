Amy Marcy Beach, née Amy Marcy Cheney, married name Mrs. H.H.A. Beach  (born Sept. 5, 1867, Henniker, N.H., U.S.—died  Dec. 27, 1944, New York, N.Y.) American pianist and composer known for her Piano Concerto (1900) and her Gaelic Symphony (1894), the first symphony by an American woman composer.
Amy Cheney had already demonstrated precocious musical talent when the family moved to Boston in 1870. She began taking piano lessons at age six, although she had been composing simple melodies on the keyboard since age four. In October 1883, at the age of 16, she gave her first public recital at Boston Music Hall. Several more successful recitals followed, and in March 1885 she played the Chopin Piano Concerto in F Minor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
