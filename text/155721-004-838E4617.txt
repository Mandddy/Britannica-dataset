Prince Albert National Park,  park in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Its main entrance is 25 miles (40 km) northwest of the city of Prince Albert. Established in 1927, the park covers an area of 1,496 square miles (3,875 square km) and is largely a woodland and lake area, interlaced with streams and nature trails. The park lies north of the great agricultural prairies between the watershed areas of the Churchill and North Saskatchewan rivers. It includes the large lakes Kingsmere, Waskesiu, and Crean and dozens of smaller lakes. Normally the parkâ€™s lakes form connected waterways and offer facilities for extended canoe and boat trips. It is a sanctuary for birds (notably cormorants and white pelicans), moose, elk, caribou, and bears and other fur-bearing animals. A museum at Waskesiu, the park headquarters, near the eastern boundary, houses a collection of wildlife species.
