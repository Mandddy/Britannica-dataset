William Wyler, byname of Willi Wyler  (born July 1, 1902, Mülhausen, Germany [now Mulhouse, France]—died July 27, 1981, Beverly Hills, California, U.S.) German-born American director of motion pictures that combined a high degree of technical polish with a clear narrative style and sensitive handling of human relationships. Most of his feature films were so-called prestige pictures based on novels or plays. Wyler was a perfectionist whose relentless pursuit of realism and emotional complexity was sometimes excoriated by exhausted actors and budget-conscious studio executives. His painstaking methods on the set earned him the nickname “40-Take Wyler,” yet a plethora of actors won Academy Awards for their work with Wyler, who was himself the recipient of three Academy Awards and eight additional nominations for best director.
Wyler, the son of a Swiss merchant father and an opera-loving German mother, grew up in the Alsace-Lorraine region, which passed back and forth between France and Germany in 19th and 20th centuries. Although his youthful bad behaviour resulted in his expulsion from a number of schools, Wyler attended the École Supérieure de Commerce in Lausanne, Switzerland, and briefly studied violin at the Paris Conservatory. During a visit to Europe, his mother’s distant cousin Carl Laemmle, the head of Universal Pictures, invited Wyler to the United States to work for the studio. Wyler began working at Universal’s New York City-based international publicity department in 1920, but by 1922 he had transferred to the Universal City lot in California, where he worked as an office boy, property boy, script clerk, and assistant casting director.
