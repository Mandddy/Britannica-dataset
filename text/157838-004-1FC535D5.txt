Chris Rock ,  (born February 7, 1966, Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.) American comedian whose popular stand-up routine—which often addressed racial matters—led to a successful film career.
Rock grew up in the impoverished Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York. After dropping out of high school at 17 (he later received a high-school-equivalency diploma), Rock played small clubs in the New York area, where he was discovered by comedian-actor Eddie Murphy. After landing parts in Murphy’s film Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) and director Keenen Ivory Wayans’s I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988), Rock got his big break by earning a spot in 1990 as a cast member of Saturday Night Live. He left the show in 1993 to join the Fox network’s In Living Color, which was taken off the air shortly thereafter. After starring in and writing the script for the film CB4 (1993), he covered the 1996 presidential campaign for ABC’s Politically Incorrect. Rock then appeared in the first of his HBO comedy specials, Big Ass Jokes (1994), which won a CableACE Award. Soon after, however, Rock found his popularity as an actor and comedian beginning to fade.
