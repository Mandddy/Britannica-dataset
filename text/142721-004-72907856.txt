Established in 1940, it has an area of 124 square miles (322 square km) and is located about 35 miles (56 km) north of Udhagamandalam on the main road to Mysore. The sanctuary is composed of hills and valleys with several perennial streams and swamps. The thick jungle growth of teak, rosewood, laurel, and bamboo provides cover for the elephants, gaurs (Indian bison), tigers, black leopards, sloth bears, hyenas, jackals, wild pigs, pythons, gray jungle fowl, spur fowl, and golden eagles found in the preserve. It has a network of fair-weather tracks and observation towers overlooking salt licks and water holes; riding elephants are available for transport.
