Zhang Heng, Wade-Giles romanization Chang Heng  (born 78 ce—died 139) Chinese mathematician, astronomer, and geographer. His seismoscope for registering earthquakes was apparently cylindrical in shape, with eight dragons’ heads arranged around its upper circumference, each with a ball in its mouth. Below were eight frogs, each directly under a dragon’s head. When an earthquake occurred, a ball dropped and was caught by a frog’s mouth, generating a sound.
