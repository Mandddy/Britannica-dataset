Distance-measuring equipment (DME), in aerial navigation, equipment for measuring distance by converting the time a special electronic pulse takes to travel from an aircraft to a ground station and for an answering pulse to return. The airborne equipment displays the information to the pilot. When used in connection with a radio-range bearing, which indicates direction, a DME reading shows the pilot the exact position of his aircraft.
