Son of Frankenstein, American horror film, released in 1939, that featured Boris Karloff in his final role as the fabled monster. Following Frankenstein (1931) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935), it was the third film in Universal Pictures’ Frankenstein series.
In the film, Basil Rathbone portrayed Baron Wolf von Frankenstein—son of the monster’s creator—who returns to his late father’s estate with his wife (played by Josephine Hutchinson) and young son (Donnie Dunagan), seeking to restore his family’s reputation and honour. Upon discovering that the monster is still alive in a comatose state, Frankenstein revives the body in order to tame the monster and thereby prove to the public that his father’s intentions were not malicious. However, the elder Frankenstein’s deranged assistant, Ygor (Bela Lugosi), who was hanged for having stolen corpses but survived with a broken neck, takes the opportunity to exact revenge on the jurors who had convicted him: he commands the monster to murder them. When several of the jurors turn up dead, the village focuses its attention on Frankenstein, who in a fury kills Ygor. The monster, enraged by the loss of his only friend, then kidnaps Frankenstein’s son, but the child is eventually rescued when his father pushes the monster to his death in a pit of molten sulfur.
