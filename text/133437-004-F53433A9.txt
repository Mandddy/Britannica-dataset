Amīr ʿAbbas Hoveyda,  Hoveyda also spelled Hoveida   (born Feb. 18, 1919, Tehrān—died  April 7, 1979, Tehrān) prime minister of Iran under Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi from January 1965 to August 1977.
After taking political science degrees at the universities of Brussels and Paris, Hoveyda joined the Iranian Foreign Office and served in Paris (1945–47), Bonn (1947–51), Ankara (1957), and at the United Nations in New York City (1951–57). In 1958 he was appointed to the board of the National Iranian Oil Company. After becoming prime minister he organized the October 1971 festivities at Persepolis commemorating the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire. As leader of the ruling Iran Novin (New Iran) Party he won a landslide victory at the 1971 general elections. Iran’s financial strength enabled Hoveyda to strike advantageous bargains with Western customers for Iranian oil in order to promote Iran’s own economic development. But the Shah’s gratitude proved limited and on Aug. 7, 1977, Hoveyda was replaced by Jamshid Amouzegar. In November 1978 Hoveyda was detained by the Shah’s short-lived military government. At the time of the February 1979 uprising he gave himself up to the new government appointed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Two months later he was sentenced to death by the Islāmic Revolutionary Court and shot the same day.
