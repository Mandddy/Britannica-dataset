Luigi Boccherini, in full Luigi Rodolfo Boccherini   (born February 19, 1743, Lucca [Italy]—died May 28, 1805, Madrid, Spain) Italian composer and cellist who influenced the development of the string quartet as a musical genre and who composed the first music for a quintet for strings, as well as a quintet for strings and piano. His approximately 500 works also include sacred music, symphonies, and concerti.
Luigi Rodolfo was the third child of a double-bass player, Leopoldo Boccherini, and the brother of Giovanni Gastoni Boccherini, a notable poet and dancer who wrote librettos for Antonio Salieri and Joseph Haydn. At an early age he was put under the care of the musical director of the local cathedral. When he reached the age of 13, he was sent to Rome to study with the renowned cellist Giovanni Battista Costanzi, musical director at Saint Peter’s Basilica. In Rome Boccherini was influenced by the polyphonic tradition (i.e., music with two or more interweaving melodic parts) stemming from the works of Giovanni da Palestrina and from the instrumental music of Arcangelo Corelli.
