Loganiaceae, family of flowering plants in the order Gentianales, containing 13 genera with more than 400 species of woody vines, shrubs, or trees native primarily to tropical areas of the world. Members of the family bear leaflike appendages at the base of the leafstalks and have terminal flower clusters. The ring of petals on each flower has four or five overlapping lobes. Fruits vary from capsules to fleshy drupes.
Some species of pinkroot (Spigelia) are known to be highly poisonous, but several, including S. marilandica, are also cultivated as ornamentals. Poisonous alkaloids found in the bark and seeds of plants of the genus Strychnos are used in arrow poisons such as curare and in drugs that stimulate the heart and central nervous system. Natal orange (Strychnos spinosa) of southern Africa produces a yellow berry with edible pulp.
