Atlanta, city, capital (1868) of Georgia, U.S., and seat (1853) of Fulton county (but also partly in DeKalb county), in the northwestern part of the state. It lies in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, just southeast of the Chattahoochee River. Atlanta is Georgia’s largest city and the principal trade and transportation centre of the southeastern United States. It is the centre of an extensive metropolitan area that includes 20 counties and cities such as Decatur, East Point, and Marietta. Pop. (2000) 416,474; Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Marietta Metro Area, 4,247,981; (2010) 420,003; Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Marietta Metro Area, 5,268,860.
Atlanta owes its existence to the railroads, the routes of which were determined by geography. Lying as it does at the southern extremity of the Appalachian Mountains, it became the gateway through which most overland traffic had to pass between the southern Atlantic Seaboard and regions to the west. In 1837 a spot near what is now Five Points, in the centre of the present-day city, was selected for the southern terminus of a railroad that was subsequently built northward to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The location was known first as Terminus and then as Marthasville; in 1845 it was renamed Atlanta for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. Several other rail lines had converged on the city by 1860.
