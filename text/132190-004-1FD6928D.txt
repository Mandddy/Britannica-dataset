Basil, byname Basil the Wolf, Romanian Vasile Lupu  (born c. 1595—died 1661, Constantinople) ambitious and enterprising prince of Moldavia (1634–53) who introduced the first written laws and printing press to his principality.
Albanian in origin, Basil acceded to the throne of Moldavia in the spring of 1634. He intrigued throughout his reign to acquire the Walachian throne as well, and in 1637 and 1639 led unsuccessful expeditions against the ruling prince of Walachia, Matthew Basarab. Basil’s military expenses and payments to his Turkish overlords taxed his subjects; but his rule also brought important cultural improvements through the creation of Greek monastic schools, the first codification of Moldavian civil and criminal law (1646), and the establishment of the first printing press in the country at Iaşi. In 1653 he was briefly evicted from his throne by Matthew Basarab and the Prince of Transylvania, but regained his crown with the help of the cossacks of Bohdan Chmielnicki, hetman of the Ukraine and also his son-in-law. He subsequently pressed into Walachia, but was decisively beaten at Vinta (July 1653). Deposed by his own boyars, he fled to the Khan of the Tatars, and thence to Constantinople, where he died in prison. His reign was one of the longest in the history of Moldavia.
