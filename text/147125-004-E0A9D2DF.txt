Qiblah, also spelled qibla or kiblah,  the direction of the sacred shrine of the Kaʿbah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, toward which Muslims turn five times each day when performing the salat (daily ritual prayer). Soon after Muhammad’s emigration (Hijrah, or Hegira) to Medina in 622, he indicated Jerusalem as the qiblah, probably influenced by Jewish tradition. When Jewish-Muslim relations no longer seemed promising, Muhammad changed the qiblah to Mecca.
The qiblah is used not only for prayer but also for burial; the dead, including slaughtered animals, are interred facing Mecca. In a mosque, the qiblah is indicated by the mihrab, a niche in the mosque’s interior wall facing Mecca.
