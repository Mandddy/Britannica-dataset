Goulburn River,  river that, together with the Campaspe and Loddon rivers, drains most of central Victoria, Australia. Rising on Mount Singleton in the Eastern Highlands northeast of Melbourne in Fraser National Park, the Goulburn flows generally north for 352 miles (563 km) through the Eildon, Goulburn, and Waranga reservoirs and Lake Nagambie to join the Murray River 7 miles (11 km) northeast of Echuca. The principal settlements in its valley are Seymour and Shepparton. The river, crossed by the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell in 1824, was named for a British under secretary of state for the colonies. Pastoralism was the dominant land use in the region until succeeded by wheat farming in the 1870s. Irrigation, introduced in the 1880s, allows fruit and vegetable farming, dairying, and sheep raising to be practiced in the area. Irrigation, however, has also caused a rise in water tables consisting of saline groundwater, and, as a result, the increased salinity of the soil has become a problem.
