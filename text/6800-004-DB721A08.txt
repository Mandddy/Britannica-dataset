Louise Bourgeois,  (born December 25, 1911, Paris, France—died May 31, 2010, New York, New York, U.S.) French-born sculptor known for her monumental abstract and often biomorphic works that deal with the relationships of men and women.
Born to a family of tapestry weavers, Bourgeois made her first drawings to assist her parents in their restoration of ancient tapestries. She attended the Sorbonne, where she studied mathematics. At age 25 she changed her focus to art, studying at the École des Beaux-Arts, the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, and the studio of Fernand Léger, and in 1938 she married and returned with her American husband, the art historian Robert Goldwater, to New York City. There she began exhibiting her distinctly Surrealist paintings and engravings. In the late 1940s she began to experiment with sculptural forms, producing a series of long, lean wooden shapes that she exhibited singly and in groups.
