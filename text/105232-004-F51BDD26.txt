Mauna Loa, the world’s largest volcano, located on the south-central part of the island of Hawaii, Hawaii state, U.S., and a part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. One of the largest single mountain masses in the world, Mauna Loa (meaning “Long Mountain” in Hawaiian) rises to 13,677 feet (4,169 metres) above sea level and constitutes half of the island’s area. Its dome is 75 miles (120 km) long and 64 miles (103 km) wide. Moku‘āweoweo, its summit caldera, has an area of nearly 6 square miles (15 square km) and a depth of 600 feet (180 metres). Frequently snowcapped in winter, Mauna Loa is a shield volcano that has erupted some three dozen times since its first well-documented eruption in 1843. Many of its eruptions are confined within Moku‘āweoweo Caldera; others are lower flank eruptions along northeast or southwest fissure zones. During eruptions in 1935 and 1942, U.S. military planes dropped bombs in attempts (that were partially successful) to divert the path of lava flows that threatened the city of Hilo. In June 1950 a 23-day flow from a 13-mile (21-km) fissure in the southwest rift destroyed a small village. Substantial eruptions at the summit occurred in 1975 and 1984.
