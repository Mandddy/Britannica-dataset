Pierre Lescot,  (born c. 1515, Paris, Fr.â€”died  1578, Paris) one of the great French architects of the mid-16th century who contributed a decorative style that provided the foundation for the classical tradition of French architecture.
In his youth Lescot, who came from a wealthy family of lawyers, studied mathematics, architecture, and painting. There is no evidence that he visited Italy, although much of his design was classical; it appears that he acquired his knowledge of architecture from illustrated books and from Roman ruins in France.
