Heptathlon, athletics competition in which contestants take part in seven different track-and-field events in two days. The heptathlon replaced the women’s pentathlon in the Olympic Games after 1981. The women’s heptathlon consists of the 100-metre hurdles, high jump, shot put, and 200-metre run on the first day; and the running long (broad) jump, javelin throw, and 800-metre run on the second day. Competitors are scored for their performance in each event according to a table established by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Jackie Joyner-Kersee, two-time U.S. Olympic gold-medal winner, was the most-notable heptathlete. A less-common men’s version of the heptathlon takes place indoors and replaces the hurdles, javelin throw, and runs with the 60-metre hurdles, pole vault, and 60- and 100-metre runs.
