Valdemar I, byname Valdemar the Great, Danish Valdemar den Store  (born Jan. 14, 1131, Denmark—died May 12, 1182, Denmark) king of Denmark (1157–82) who ended the Wend (Slav) threat to Danish shipping, won independence from the Holy Roman emperor, and gained church approval for hereditary rule by his dynasty, the Valdemars.
The son of Knud Lavard, duke of South Jutland, and a great-grandson of the Danish king Sweyn II, Valdemar gained sole possession of the monarchy, concluding more than 25 years of civil wars waged by competing contenders for the throne. He soon began a series of expeditions against the Wends, aided by his foster brother Absalon, whom he made bishop of Roskilde. By 1169 his forces had captured the Wendish stronghold of Rügen (now in Germany), which was incorporated into the diocese of Roskilde, and had stormed the Wend sanctuary at Arcona. A year later, however, he was forced to divide his gains with his ally Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony.
