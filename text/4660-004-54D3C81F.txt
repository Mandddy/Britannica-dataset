Thessaloníki, formerly Salonika, historically Thessalonica,  city, capital and residence of the minister for northern Greece and administrative centre of the nomós (department) of Thessaloníki, on the west side of the Chalcidice (Modern Greek: Chalkidikí) peninsula at the head of a bay on the Gulf of Thérmai (Thermaïkós). An important industrial and commercial centre, second to Athens (Athína) in population and to Piraeus as a port, it is built on the foothills and slopes of Mount Khortiátis (Kissós; 3,940 ft [1,201 m]), overlooking the delta plains of the Gallikós and Vardar (Axiós or Vardaráis) rivers.
Founded in 316 bce and named for a sister of Alexander the Great, Thessaloníki after 146 was the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia. As a military and commercial station on the Via Egnatia, which ran from the Adriatic Sea east to Byzantium (i.e., Constantinople), it grew to great importance in the Roman Empire. Two letters written by the Apostle Paul were addressed to its inhabitants (Thessalonians), and its first bishop, Gaius, was one of Paul’s companions. The city prospered in the Byzantine Empire despite repeated attacks by Avars and Slavs in the 6th and 7th centuries. In 732, two years after he prohibited icons, the Byzantine emperor Leo III (reigned 717–741) detached the city from papal jurisdiction and made it dependent on the patriarch of Constantinople. During the iconoclastic regimes of Leo and his successors, the city defended the use of icons in worship and acted to save some of these art treasures.
