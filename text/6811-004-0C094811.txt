Box elder, also called ash-leaved maple,  (Acer negundo), hardy and fast-growing tree, of the soapberry family (Sapindaceae), native to the central and eastern United States. Introduced to Europe, it is widely cultivated there as an ornamental. The tree grows to 9–15 m (30–50 feet) tall. The compound leaves (rare among maples) consist of three, five, or seven coarsely toothed leaflets. The single seed is borne in a samara, or key—i.e., a broad, flat winglike structure. Owing to its quick growth and its drought resistance, the box elder was widely planted for shade by early settlers in the prairie areas of the United States. Maple syrup and sugar are sometimes obtained from the box elder. Its wood is used for crates, furniture, paper pulp, and charcoal.
