Nathan Marcus Adler,  (born Jan. 15, 1803, Hanover [Germany]—died  Jan. 21, 1890, Brighton, East Sussex, Eng.) chief rabbi of the British Empire, who founded Jews’ College and the United Synagogue.
Adler became chief rabbi of Oldenburg in 1829 and of Hanover in 1830. On Oct. 13, 1844, he was elected chief rabbi in London. There he originated and carried out his scheme for a Jewish college for teachers (Jews’ College, still in existence), which was founded in London on Nov. 11, 1855, with Adler himself as its first president. In 1860 he formulated a plan to establish a United Synagogue to bring all the British congregations under a central administration; this idea was realized in 1870, when Parliament passed the United Synagogue bill.
