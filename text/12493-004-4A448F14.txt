Cyclamen, genus of more than 20 species of flowering perennial herbs of the myrsine family (Myrsinaceae) that are native to the Middle East and southern and central Europe. The floristâ€™s cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum), the best-known species, is notable as an indoor plant cultivated for its attractive white to pink to deep red flowers. A number of other species of Cyclamen are grown outside.
The plants grow from a tuber (a short underground stem) and have no stem aboveground. Long-stalked, roundish, or kidney-shaped leaves, often variously marked, grow from the base. Solitary flowers grow on stalks less than 30 cm (12 inches) tall. After flowering, the flower stalk often twists into a spiral, so bringing the capsular fruit close to the ground.
