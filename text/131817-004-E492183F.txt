Asher Benjamin,  (born June 15, 1773, Greenfield, Mass. [U.S.]—died  July 26, 1845, Springfield, Mass.) American architect who was an early follower of Charles Bulfinch. His greatest influence on American architecture, lasting until about 1860, was through the publication of several handbooks, from which many other 18th-century architects and builders, including Ammi Young and Ithiel Town, copied plans. These books included the various editions of American Builder’s Companion; The Architect, or Practical House Carpenter; Practice of Architecture; and Builder’s Guide. These and other works were reprinted in the second half of the 20th century.
Benjamin was trained as a carpenter. Early in his career, he designed many residences in and near Greenfield, Mass. In 1803 he moved to Boston and came under the influence of Bulfinch. He designed houses throughout the state, including Linden Hall (Springfield, 1811), West Church (Boston, 1806), and Headquarter’s House (Boston, 1807–08).
