Gustav Vigeland, in full Adolf Gustav Vigeland   (born April 11, 1869, Mandal, Norway—died March 12, 1943, Oslo) Norwegian sculptor who was best known for creating an outdoor sculpture complex in Frogner Park, Oslo.
Vigeland, whose father was a carpenter, was apprenticed to a wood-carver in 1884. He attended art schools in Oslo and Copenhagen and then spent several months in Paris in 1893. While there, he visited the studio of Auguste Rodin; that sculptor’s influence can be seen in the highly realistic, emotional style of Vigeland’s early work.
