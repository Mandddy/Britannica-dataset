James Earl Jones,  (born January 17, 1931, Arkabutla, Mississippi, U.S.) American actor who made his name in leading stage roles in Shakespeare’s Othello and in The Great White Hope, a play about the tragic career of the first black heavyweight boxing champion, loosely based on the life of Jack Johnson. Beginning in the 1970s, he appeared frequently on television and in film.
His father, the actor Robert Earl Jones, left his family before James Earl Jones was born, and the youth was raised largely by his grandparents in Michigan. He attended the University of Michigan (B.A., 1953), majoring in drama, and, after a brief stint in the U.S. Army, went to New York City, studying at the American Theatre Wing with Lee Strasberg. He acted in his first Off-Broadway production in 1957 and subsequently with the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1961–73. He won a Tony Award for his boxer role in Howard Sackler’s The Great White Hope (1968) and later starred in the film version (1970). He received critical acclaim for the two-character stage play Paul Robeson (1978) and in the title role of Othello (1981), opposite Christopher Plummer’s Iago. In 1987 Jones starred in the Broadway premiere of August Wilson’s Fences. His later Broadway credits include a 2008 production of Tennessee Williams’s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof that featured an all-black cast, as well as productions of Driving Miss Daisy (2010), Gore Vidal’s The Best Man (2012), and George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s You Can’t Take It with You (2014).
