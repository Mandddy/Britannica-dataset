Charles Nodier,  (born April 29, 1780, Besançon, France—died January 27, 1844, Paris) writer more important for the influence he had on the French Romantic movement than for his own writings.
Nodier had an eventful early life, in the course of which he fell foul of the authorities for a skit on Napoleon. In 1824 he settled in Paris after his appointment as director of the Bibliothèque de l’Arsenal (Arsenal Library) and soon became one of the leaders of the literary life of the capital. In his drawing room at the Arsenal, Nodier drew together the young men who were to be the leading lights of the Romantic movement: Victor Hugo, Alfred de Musset, and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve.
