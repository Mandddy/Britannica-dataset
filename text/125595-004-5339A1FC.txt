Sashimi,  specialty of Japanese cuisine, fresh fish served raw. The fish, which must be utterly fresh, is sliced paper thin or alternately one-quarter to one-half inch (0.75â€“1.5 centimetres) thick, cubed, or cut in strips, according to the nature of the fish. The sashimi is accompanied by wasabi (green horseradish paste) and soy sauce. Sashimi is always part of a formal Japanese meal, served early while the palate is still clear in order for its nuances to be appreciated.
The most popular fish used are ocean fish: tuna, yellowtail, mackerel, sea bream, and flounder. Freshwater fish such as perch and carp are also eaten raw, as are shrimps, clams, lobster, and abalone. Sake is traditionally drunk with sashimi.
