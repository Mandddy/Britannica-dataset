Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Los Angeles that took place July 28–Aug. 12, 1984. The Los Angeles Games were the 20th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
Many communist countries—including the Soviet Union, East Germany, and Cuba—retaliated for the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow 1980 Games by staying away from the 1984 Games, citing concerns over the safety of their athletes in what they considered a hostile and fiercely anticommunist environment. China, however, participated in the Summer Games for the first time since 1952. In all, nearly 6,800 athletes representing 140 countries came to Los Angeles. The number of events for women grew to include cycling, rhythmic gymnastics, synchronized swimming, and several new track-and-field events, most notably the marathon.
