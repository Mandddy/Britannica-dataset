William Wetmore Story,  (born Feb. 12, 1819, Salem, Mass., U.S.—died Oct. 7, 1895, Vallombrosa, Italy) sculptor now remembered as the centre of a circle of literary, theatrical, and social celebrities and for his “Cleopatra.” A description of this work in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Marble Faun (1860) contributed to its wide popularity in the United States and Great Britain. There is a replica of it in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
