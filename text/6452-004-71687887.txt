Francesco Berni,  (born 1497/98, Lamporecchio, Tuscany [Italy]—died  May 26, 1535, Florence) poet and translator important for his Tuscan version of Matteo Boiardo’s epic poem Orlando innamorato (1483) and for the distinctive style of his Italian burlesque, which was called bernesco and imitated by many poets.
Berni spent his early years in Florence. In 1517 he entered the service of Cardinal Bernardo da Bibbiena and Bibbiena’s nephew, Angelo Dovizi, and then went to Verona to serve as secretary to its bishop, Matteo Giberti. When he returned to Florence, Berni became enmeshed in court intrigues and, according to some sources, was poisoned for refusing to cooperate in a plan to kill Cardinal Giovanni Salviati.
