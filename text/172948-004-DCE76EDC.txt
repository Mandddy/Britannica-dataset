Ozawa Ichirō,  (born May 24, 1942, Mizusawa City, Japan) Japanese politician who served as secretary-general of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Japan (1989–91) and as president (2006–09) and secretary-general (2009–10) of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). In 2012 he established a new political party, Kokumin no Sekikatsu ga Daiichi (People’s Life First), which, later that year, was merged into the Tomorrow Party of Japan.
After earning a B.A. in economics from Keiō University, Tokyo, in 1967, Ozawa studied law at Nihon University, Tokyo, before launching a political career. In 1969 he was elected to the lower house of the Diet (parliament); the seat had been held by his father, a powerful politician who had died the previous year. Ozawa aligned himself with Tanaka Kakuei, a Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) strongman and onetime prime minister. He stayed close to Tanaka despite the latter’s involvement in bribery scandals and then shifted his allegiance to the new kingmaker, Kanemaru Shin. Taking his cue from these backroom power brokers, Ozawa became a prodigious fund-raiser.
