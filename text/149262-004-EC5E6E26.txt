Cour de Cassation,  (French: “Court of Cassation,” or “Abrogation”), the highest court of criminal and civil appeal in France, with the power to quash (casser) the decisions of lower courts. The high court considers decisions only from the point of view of whether the lower court has applied the law correctly; it does not deal with the facts of a case, nor does it retry it. The appeals courts (see appeal) hear cases on matters of fact and retry them. The aim of the Cour de Cassation is rather to ensure a uniformity of the interpretation of the law among all the French courts. It does not, on the other hand, determine whether a particular law itself is constitutional, as do the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Japan, and the Constitutional Court of Germany.
The Cour de Cassation was instituted during the French Revolutionary period at the end of the 18th century, but its roots go back to the Middle Ages, when the king’s courts gave relief to those who felt they had been denied justice. From the 16th through the 18th century, appeals for cassation of court decisions were dealt with by the Privy Council section of the king’s council. By the late 17th century the council’s powers were limited to voiding decisions that violated the law. The spirit of the French Revolution reinforced this limitation, for the French, by preventing the judiciary from voiding the work of the legislature, in effect refused to allow one branch of government to infringe on the domain of any other. This practice embodied a stricter interpretation of the doctrine of separation of powers than that provided for in the United States Constitution, which allowed the judiciary certain powers to limit the actions of the executive and the legislature.
