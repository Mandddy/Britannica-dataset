Hermann Maier,  (born December 7, 1972, Flachau, Austria) Austrian skier who won two gold medals at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, and one silver at the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy.
As a child Maier idolized the great World Cup skiers of the day, including fellow countryman Franz Klammer. Maier’s father owned a skiing school, and the boy developed superior technique at a young age. He was accepted into the Austrian national ski academy at age 15 but was dropped from the program within a year because of knee problems and his small size (50 kg; 110 lb). He took a job as a bricklayer’s apprentice and during the winters worked as a skiing instructor.
