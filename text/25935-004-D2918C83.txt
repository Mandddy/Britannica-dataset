Louis Riel,  (born Oct. 23, 1844, St. Boniface, Assiniboia [western Canada]—died Nov. 16, 1885, Regina, District of Assiniboia, Northwest Territories, Can.) Canadian leader of the Métis in western Canada.
Riel grew up in the Red River Settlement in present-day Manitoba. He studied for the priesthood in Montreal (though he was never ordained) and worked at various jobs before returning to Red River in the late 1860s. In 1869 the settlement’s Métis population was alarmed by arrangements to transfer the territorial rights of their settlement from the Hudson’s Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada. They were especially worried about the expected influx of English-speaking settlers that this transfer would bring. Riel became spokesman for the Métis insurgents, who managed to halt the Canadian surveyors and prevent the governor-designate, William McDougall, from entering Red River. They then seized Fort Garry (now Winnipeg), the headquarters of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and established a provisional government with Riel as president to negotiate acceptable terms of union with Canada.
