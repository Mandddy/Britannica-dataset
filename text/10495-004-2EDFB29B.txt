Economic stabilizer, any of the institutions and practices in an economy that serve to reduce fluctuations in the business cycle through offsetting effects on the amounts of income available for spending (disposable income). The most important automatic stabilizers include unemployment compensation and other transfer payment programs, farm price supports, and family and corporate savings.
The ultimate objective of research into the problems of economic instability (including fluctuations in output, employment, and prices) is to provide the foundation for stabilization policy—that is, for the systematic use of fiscal and monetary policies to improve an economy’s performance. The main tasks, therefore, are to explain how levels of prices, output, and employment are determined and, on a more applied level, to furnish predictions of changes in these variables—predictions on which stabilization policy can be based.
