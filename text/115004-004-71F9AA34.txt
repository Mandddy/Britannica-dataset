Ifugao, group of wet-rice agriculturalists occupying the mountainous area of northern Luzon, Philippines. They are of Malay stock and their language is Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian), as is that of their neighbours, but they have developed a number of cultural characteristics that set them apart. They numbered nearly 70,000 in 1939, but World War II reduced their population to a figure (1948) of 50,000. By the late 20th century, their population had increased to about 190,000.
Their great system of irrigated rice terraces—steeply contoured, mountain-terraced walls of stone that lean slightly inward at the top—is world renowned and was developed with a simple technology. In addition to rice, the prestige crop, large amounts of sweet potatoes are grown on hillside plots and form the staple diet of the poorer class. Pigs and chickens are also raised, primarily for the numerous rituals and sacrifices.
