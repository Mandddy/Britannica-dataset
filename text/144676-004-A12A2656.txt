Southern African Development Community (SADC), originally (1979–92) Southern African Development Coordination Conference,  regional organization of southern African countries that works to promote economic cooperation and integration among the member states and to preserve their economic independence. The member states are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malaŵi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The first conference was held in 1979, on the eve of Zimbabwe’s (Rhodesia’s) independence under black majority rule. The SADC’s activities are coordinated at annual conferences of the heads of government and of a council of ministers from all the member states. The SADC plans, coordinates, and finances various projects in agriculture and animal husbandry, energy, mining, disease control, telecommunications, and regional trade.
Among the SADC’s earliest priorities were projects to improve the existing rail and road networks between the member states so they could reduce their dependence on South African ports and transport routes for the shipment of their imports and exports. These projects greatly improved the region’s transportation infrastructure. With the advent of majority black rule in South Africa and that country’s membership in the SADC (1994), however, the focus of the organization shifted toward greater regional economic integration.
