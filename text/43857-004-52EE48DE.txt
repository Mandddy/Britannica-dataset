Bar code, a printed series of parallel bars or lines of varying width that is used for entering data into a computer system. The bars are typically black on a white background, and their width and quantity vary according to application. The bars are used to represent the binary digits 0 and 1, sequences of which in turn can represent numbers from 0 to 9 and be processed by a digital computer. The presence or absence of a bar of a particular width in a particular position in a sequence is read by the computer as either a 0 or 1. Most such codes use bars of only two different widths (thick and thin), though some codes employ four widths. The numbers represented by a bar code are also printed out at its base.
Bar code information is read by an optical (laser) scanner that is part of a computer system. A handheld scanner or bar code pen is moved across the code, or the code itself is moved by hand across a scanner built into a checkout counter or other surface. The computer then stores or immediately processes the data in the bar code. The bar codes printed on supermarket and other retail merchandise in the United States are those of the Universal Product Code, or UPC, which assigns each type of food or grocery product a unique code. In the UPC system, the five digits on the left are assigned to a particular manufacturer or maker, and the five digits on the right are used by that manufacturer to identify a specific type or make of product. This is usually the only information contained in a bar code.
