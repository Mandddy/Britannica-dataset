Cotton harvester,  machine for harvesting cotton bolls. Mechanical cotton harvesters are of two basic types, strippers and pickers. Stripper-type harvesters strip the entire plant of both open and unopened bolls along with many leaves and stems. The unwanted material is then removed by special devices at the gin. Strippers work most satisfactorily after frost has killed the green vegetative growth. Picker machines, often referred to as spindle-type harvesters, remove the cotton from open bolls and leave the bur on the plant. The spindles, which rotate on their axes at a high speed, are attached to a drum that also turns, causing the spindles to enter the plant. The cotton fibre is wrapped around the moistened spindles and then taken off by a special device called the doffer, from which the cotton is delivered to a large basket carried above the machine. Although a cotton harvester was patented in the U.S. in 1850, economic and social conditions prevented further development and full acceptance until the 1940s.
