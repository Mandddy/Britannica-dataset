Franklin Pierce Adams, byname F.p.a.   (born Nov. 15, 1881, Chicago—died  March 23, 1960, New York City) U.S. newspaper columnist, translator, poet, and radio personality whose humorous syndicated column “The Conning Tower” earned him the reputation of godfather of the contemporary newspaper column. He wrote primarily under his initials, F.P.A.
Adams’ newspaper career began in 1903, with the Chicago Journal. The next year he went to New York, where he wrote for several newspapers. From 1913 to 1937 his column, “The Conning Tower,” appeared in the Herald Tribune and several other New York newspapers, interrupted only during the years of World War I, when Adams wrote a column for Stars and Stripes, and from 1923 to 1931, when he worked for the New York World until it ceased publication. Witty and well-written, his columns consisted of informal yet careful critiques of the contemporary U.S. scene. His column also included writing by such authors as Dorothy Parker and Sinclair Lewis. His Saturday columns imitated the language and style of Samuel Pepys’ diary, and Adams is credited with a renewal of interest in Pepys. Reprints were collected in The Diary of Our Own Samuel Pepys (1935).
