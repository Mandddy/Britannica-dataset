Lennart Meri,  (born March 29, 1929, Tallinn, Estonia—died March 14, 2006, Tallinn) Estonian scholar and political leader, who was president of Estonia from 1992 to 2001.
His father, Georg Meri, was a man of letters who served newly independent Estonia as a diplomat between World Wars I and II, and consequently Lennart was educated in Berlin, London, and Paris. After the Soviet Union annexed Estonia in 1940, Georg Meri was sent to a labour camp in Moscow and the rest of the family to Siberia. In 1946 the family was reunited in Estonia, which had become a Soviet republic. Lennart Meri received a degree in history and languages from Tartu University in 1953, and he spent much of his professional life documenting the history of the Finno-Ugric peoples in writings and in documentary films. One such film, Linnutee tuuled (1977; “The Winds of the Milky Way”), was banned in the Soviet Union but received excellent reviews for its documentation of rural folkways.
