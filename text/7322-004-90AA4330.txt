Char,  (Salvelinus), any of several freshwater food and game fishes distinguished from the similar trout by light, rather than black, spots and by a boat-shaped bone (vomer) that is toothed only in front, on the roof of the mouth. Chars are of the trout and salmon family, Salmonidae, and often have smaller scales than their relatives.
The Arctic char (S. alpinus), of North America and Europe, inhabits the Arctic and adjacent oceans and enters rivers and lakes to breed. Some populations are restricted to freshwater lakes, which they colonized in glacial times. Like the other chars, the Arctic char is a good food and sport fish. It may weigh 6.8 kg (15 pounds) or more. The brook trout, Dolly Varden trout, and lake trout are native North American chars.
