Catalan forge, medieval Spanish forge that yielded malleable iron of excellent quality. A mixture of iron ore and charcoal was heated intensely for several hours in a forge, forming a spongy mass of iron permeated by slag. At the correct time, the glowing ball of iron was withdrawn from the forge and hammered while hot to expel the slag.
