Joan Fontaine, byname of Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland  (born October 22, 1917, Tokyo, Japan—died December 15, 2013, Carmel, California, U.S.) English American actress known for her portrayals of troubled beauties.
De Havilland was born in Tokyo, where her English father worked as a patent attorney and language professor; her mother was an actress. In 1919 she and her elder sister, Olivia, moved with their mother to California, briefly staying in San Francisco before settling in Saratoga. Her parents divorced in 1925, and both soon remarried. Her stepfather’s demanding standards of behaviour led to conflicts with the girls. In 1933 Olivia moved out (after he insisted that she drop out of a school play that she had been cast in or leave home), and Joan was sent to stay with her father in Tokyo, where she enrolled in the American School. However, she returned to California a year later.
