Flanders, Flemish Vlaanderen, formally Flemish Region, Flemish Vlaamse Gewest,  region that constitutes the northern half of Belgium. Along with the Walloon Region and the Brussels-Capital Region, the self-governing Flemish Region was created during the federalization of Belgium, largely along ethnolinguistic lines, in the 1980s and ’90s. Its elected government has broad authority over social and economic policy and administration. Flanders includes the provinces of Antwerp, East Flanders, Limburg, Flemish Brabant, and West Flanders. A small portion of the region is located outside Belgium proper: Baarle-Hertog (Baerle-Duc), a municipality administered by Antwerp province, is composed of a number of small enclaves in the Netherlands (the Dutch municipality of Baarle-Nassau is interwoven with these enclaves). The Brussels-Capital Region lies within but is administratively separate from Flanders; however, the city of Brussels also serves as the capital of the Flemish Region.
Flanders is predominantly flat. The Kempenland, the plateau region in the northeastern part of Flanders, is characterized by sand dunes and areas of broom, heather, and poor pasture. There are extensive blocks of coniferous plantations. The low, undulating Central Plateaus occupy the central part of the region. The northwest consists of a fertile low-lying plain. Farther west are the Flemish polders (land reclaimed from the sea), which are seamed with drainage channels and which extend for 6–10 miles (10–16 km) inland. The straight unembayed coastline of maritime Flanders is backed by a rampart of sand dunes. Important rivers in the region include the Schelde, Dender, Dijle, Nete, Rupel, Yser, and Meuse, the last of which forms a portion of the border with the Netherlands. Flanders has a temperate climate, with strong maritime influences in the west.
