Protractor, any of a group of instruments used to construct and measure plane angles. The simplest protractor comprises a semicircular disk graduated in degrees—from 0° to 180°. It is an ancient device that was already in use during the 13th century. At that time, European instrument makers constructed an astronomical observing device called the torquetum that was equipped with a semicircular protractor.
A more complex form of protractor, designed for plotting the position of a ship on navigational charts, was invented in 1801 by Joseph Huddart, a U.S. naval captain. This instrument, called a three-arm protractor, or station pointer, is composed of a circular scale connected to three arms. The centre arm is fixed, while the outer two are rotatable, capable of being set at any angle relative to the centre one.
