Mexican hairless, also called Xoloitzcuintli,  breed of dog that is probably descended from hairless Chinese or African dogs that were taken by Spanish traders to Mexico in the late 16th century. A rather long-legged dog, the Mexican hairless comes in three sizes: toy, which stands 11 to 12 inches (28 to 30.5 cm) and weighs 9 to 18 pounds (4 to 8 kg); miniature, which stands 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38 cm) and weighs 13 to 22 pounds (6 to 10 kg); and standard, which stands 16 to 22.5 inches (41 to 57 cm) and weighs 20 to 31 pounds (9 to 14 kg). The breed is hairless except for a topknot and some fuzz on its long tail; its soft skin is pink, slate, or gray in colour. However, dogs with short coats also appear in many litters. The breed, which is known as the Chinese dog in Mexico, is not formally recognized by the American Kennel Club.
