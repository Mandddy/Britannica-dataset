Alcide Dessalines d’ Orbigny,  (born Sept. 6, 1802, Couëron, Fr.—died  June 30, 1857, near Saint-Denis) founder of the science of micropaleontology.
During eight years of travel in South America (1826–34) Orbigny studied the people, natural history, and geology of the continent. He summarized these studies in Voyage dans l’Amérique méridionale, 10 vol., (1834–47; “Journey into South America”) and proceeded to draw up the first comprehensive map of that continent (1842). The most important result of his work was the founding of the science of stratigraphical paleontology, based on his observations of exposed fossil-bearing strata in the Paraná Basin. He realized that the distinct layers of sedimentary rock must have been deposited in water at successive periods of time, which could be known by dating the fossils found in each layer. Thus, he was the first to divide geological formations into stages of deposition. He believed, however, that each stage represented an independent fauna made by a special act of creation. His position thus differed radically from the evolutionary theory advanced by Charles Darwin, who had explored much of South America and observed many of the same phenomena during the time that Orbigny was there.
