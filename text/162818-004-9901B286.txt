Francesco Sforza,  (born July 23, 1401, San Miniato, Tuscany [Italy]—died March 8, 1466, Milan) condottiere who played a crucial role in 15th-century Italian politics and, as duke of Milan, founded a dynasty that ruled for nearly a century.
The illegitimate son of a mercenary commander, Muzio Attendolo Sforza, Francesco grew up at the court of Ferrara and accompanied his father to Naples, where Muzio entered the employ of King Ladislas. Francesco later served in Muzio’s company until 1424, when his father drowned in battle against an old rival, the condottiere Braccio da Montone. Francesco then took over the command, defeating and fatally wounding Braccio near L’Aquila, northeast of Rome. Entering the service of Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan, Sforza fought alternately for and against him in the succeeding 20 years. During periods of uneasy truce he became betrothed (1433) to and married (1441) the duke’s illegitimate daughter and only child, Bianca Maria.
