Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, née Pierrepont  (baptized May 26, 1689, London, Eng.—died Aug. 21, 1762, London) the most colourful Englishwoman of her time and a brilliant and versatile writer.
Her literary genius, like her personality, had many facets. She is principally remembered as a prolific letter writer in almost every epistolary style; she was also a distinguished minor poet, always competent, sometimes glittering and genuinely eloquent. She is further remembered as an essayist, feminist, traveler, and eccentric. Her beauty was marred by a severe attack of smallpox while she was still a young woman, and she later pioneered in England the practice of inoculation against the disease, having noticed the effectiveness of this precaution during a stay in Turkey.
