François Quesnay,  (born June 4, 1694, near Paris, France—died December 16, 1774, Versailles) French economist and intellectual leader of the physiocrats, the first systematic school of political economy.
Quesnay served as the consulting physician to King Louis XV at Versailles. Late in life he developed an interest in economics, publishing his first book on the subject in his 60s. With the support of Madame de Pompadour, he and fellow physiocrat Jean de Gournay became influential in the Secte des Économistes, whose members looked to Quesnay as their leader.
