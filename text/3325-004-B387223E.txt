Paeonius,  (flourished 450–400 bc) Greek sculptor, native of Mende in Thrace, a contemporary of the sculptors Phidias and Polyclitus.
Paeonius is famous for his statue of the Nike, or “Winged Victory” (c. 420 bc; Archaeological Museum, Olympia), which was found in Olympia in 1875. An inscription on its pedestal states that the statue commemorated a victory of the Messenians and the Naupactians over an unnamed enemy, probably the Spartans.
