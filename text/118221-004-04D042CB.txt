Matthias William Baldwin,  (born Dec. 10, 1795, Elizabethtown, N.J., U.S.—died  Sept. 7, 1866, Philadelphia, Pa.) manufacturer whose significant improvements of the steam locomotive included a steam-tight metal joint that permitted his engines to use steam at double the pressure of others.
Originally trained as a jeweler but experienced in industrial design and manufacture, Baldwin was approached in 1832 by the Philadelphia and Germantown Railroad, which needed a locomotive. The commission proved to be the start of the Baldwin Locomotive Works. During its founder’s lifetime, the plant built more than 1,500 locomotives.
