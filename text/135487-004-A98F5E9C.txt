Frank Stanton, in full Frank Nicholas Stanton  (born March 20, 1908, Muskegon, Mich., U.S.—died Dec. 24, 2006, Boston, Mass.) innovative American radio and television executive, who was president of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) from 1946 to 1971.
Stanton grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and attended Ohio Wesleyan University (B.A., 1930) and Ohio State University (M.A., 1932; Ph.D., 1935). His doctoral dissertation on measuring the reactions of broadcast audiences to radio programming led to a summer job with the network. His subsequent rise in the broadcasting hierarchy was rapid, and by age 38 he was president of CBS. With chairman William S. Paley, Stanton helped transform CBS into a communications empire, especially noted for its powerful and preeminent television network. Combining popular entertainment programming—including I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners—with highly respected journalism, CBS was acclaimed as the “Tiffany Network.”
