Vesicular stomatitis,  viral disease causing blisters in the mouths of cattle, horses, and mules and on the snouts and feet of swine. Horses and cattle with vesicular stomatitis become feverish two to five days after exposure. After the blisters break, the fever subsides, and the animal usually recovers. Differential diagnosis between vesicular stomatitis, vesicular exanthema, and foot-and-mouth disease, all of which display similar symptoms, is based partly on the differing susceptibilities to the three diseases among horses, cattle, and swine.
