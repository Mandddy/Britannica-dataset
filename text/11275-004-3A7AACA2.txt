Sir Matthew Hale,  (born Nov. 1, 1609, Alderley, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died  Dec. 25, 1676, Alderley) one of the greatest scholars on the history of English common law, well known for his judicial impartiality during England’s Civil War (1642–51). He also played a major role in the law-reform proposals of the Convention Parliament and in promoting Charles II’s restoration.
Hale was the son of Robert Hale, a barrister. Orphaned at the age of five, he was educated according to Puritan principles under the direction of his guardian, until he enrolled at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1626, with the intention of taking holy orders. He soon changed his mind and began to devote most of his time to fencing, gambling, and other diversions; at one time he considered enlisting as a soldier in the service of Frederick Henry, prince of Orange. A consultation with an eminent lawyer on family business so impressed him that he chose the law as his profession. In 1628 he was admitted to Lincoln’s Inn, where he studied under the guidance of John Selden, one of the leading jurists and scholars of his age, who extended his studies to include Roman law, English history, mathematics, and natural philosophy. Called to the bar in 1637, he soon had a flourishing practice.
