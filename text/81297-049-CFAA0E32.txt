The Cherry Orchard, drama in four acts written by Anton Chekhov as Vishnyovy sad. Chekhov’s final play, it was first performed and published in 1904. Though Chekhov insisted that the play was “a comedy, in places even a farce,” playgoers and readers often find a touch of tragedy in the decline of the charming Ranevskaya family.
Madame Ranevskaya, who has spent five years in Paris to escape grief over her young son’s death, returns to her home in Russia ridden with debt. She is obliged to decide how to dispose of her family’s estate, with its beautiful and famous cherry orchard. The coarse but wealthy merchant Ermolai Lopakhin suggests that Mme Ranevskaya develop the land on which the orchard sits. Eventually Lopakhin purchases the estate and proceeds with his plans for a housing development. As the unhappy Ranevskayas leave the estate, the sound of saws can be heard in the orchard.
