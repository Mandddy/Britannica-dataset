Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana), arboreal species of guenon named for its crescent-shaped white browband that resembles the bow of the goddess Diana. The diana monkey is generally found well above the ground in West African rainforests. Its face and much of its fur are black. It has a white beard, chest, and throat; there are a white stripe along each thigh and a deep reddish patch on the back. On the inside of the thighs, the fur is whitish, yellowish, or reddish. The roloway monkey (C. d. roloway) is a subspecies or closely related species with a longer beard and broader diadem (browband). The diana monkey is active, hardy, and readily tamed. Although engaging when young, it is less friendly as an adult.
