João Goulart, in full João Belchior Marques Goulart, byname Jango   (born March 1, 1918, São Borja, Braz.—died  Dec. 6, 1976, Corrientes province, Arg.) reformist president of Brazil (1961–64) until he was deposed.
The son of a wealthy rancher, Goulart graduated from the law school of Porto Alegre University in 1939. As a protégé of Getúlio Vargas, the populist president of Brazil (1930–45, 1951–54), Goulart was elected to the Rio Grande do Sul state legislature in 1946 and later became the state’s secretary of justice and the interior. In 1953 and 1954 he served under President Vargas as minister of labour, industry, and commerce and worked for labour legislation reform. He was President Juscelino Kubitschek’s vice president from 1956 to 1961. Again elected vice president in 1960, he took over the presidency in 1961 after the resignation of President Jânio Quadros, in spite of strong opposition by the military, who accused Goulart of communist sympathies. During his administration he irritated the United States by strengthening ties with communist countries and by undertaking a program of radical reforms. He won passage of a law limiting foreign companies’ export of their profits, tried to persuade Congress to approve a controversial land-redistribution program, and, on the eve of his ouster, proposed a package of reforms that would have benefited the working class but was clearly tied to his desire to extend his stay in office. Goulart presided over an economy crippled by galloping inflation, and he was constantly beset by criticism from both the far left and the military. He was deposed by a military coup in 1964 and died in exile at his ranch in northern Argentina.
