Melon cactus (genus Melocactus), any of about 30 species of plants in the family Cactaceae, native to the West Indies, Central America, and tropical South America. They are distinguished by a woolly and bristly mass, the cephalium, that forms atop the plant when it reaches a certain age, varying with the species. Carmine to pink flowers push up through the cephalium, with only the tips being visible; they are followed by fruits, which are usually pink. The common names Turk’s head or Turk’s cap refer to the reddish crownlike cephalium. Melocactus species are also called melon cacti or melones for their size and shape. The Jamaican species M. communis is up to 100 cm (about 3 feet) tall and 30 cm (about 1 foot) wide.
