Adige River, Italian Fiume Adige, Latin Athesis, German Etsch,  longest stream of Italy after the Po River. The Adige rises in the north from two Alpine mountain lakes below Resia Pass and flows rapidly through the Venosta Valley south and east past Merano and Bolzano. Having received the waters of the Isarco River at Bolzano, the Adige turns south to flow through the Trentino-Alto Adige region in its middle course, known as the Lagarina Valley. Entering the Po lowland near Verona, it veers southeast and, after several long meanders, enters the Adriatic Sea just south of Chioggia and north of the Po River delta after a course of 255 miles (410 km). It drains a basin of 4,710 square miles (12,200 square km).
In early Christian times the river’s course was probably several miles farther north until, about ad 589, the river broke through its banks and built its present course. The dikes constructed during the past several centuries have had to be raised several times; the last 50 miles (80 km) or so of the river’s course are entirely man-made. The Adige supplies hydroelectric power in its upper Alpine section and irrigation for the Veneto in its lower course. Floods, such as occurred in 1951 and 1966, do great damage and require constant control of the riverbank.
