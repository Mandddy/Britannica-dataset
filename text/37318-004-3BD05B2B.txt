Jack Lang, in full John Thomas Lang   (born Dec. 21, 1876, Sydney—died  Sept. 27, 1975, Sydney) Australian statesman and Labor premier of New South Wales (1925–27, 1930–32) whose defiance of Australia’s Labor prime minister James Henry Scullin’s economic policies contributed to Scullin’s defeat in 1931 and to the decline of the Labor Party from national power.
After entering the New South Wales Parliament in 1913, Lang rose to party secretary and state treasurer (1920–22), becoming premier and treasurer in 1925. During his first ministry he developed Australia’s first child endowment plan and sponsored a widows’ pension bill. He led the Labor parliamentary opposition (1927–30) and was elected premier in 1930 on a platform opposing the deflationary policies of the federal Labor government.
