Georges-Louis Leclerc, count de Buffon, original name (until c. 1725) Georges-Louis Leclerc, or (c. 1725–73) Georges-Louis Leclerc De Buffon  (born September 7, 1707, Montbard, France—died April 16, 1788, Paris) French naturalist, remembered for his comprehensive work on natural history, Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière (begun in 1749). He was created a count in 1773.
Buffon’s father, Benjamin Leclerc, was a state official in Burgundy; his mother was a woman of spirit and learning, and he was fond of saying that he got his intelligence from her. The name Buffon came from an estate that he inherited from his mother at about the age of 25.
