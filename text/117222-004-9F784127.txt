Claus, Graf Schenk von Stauffenberg,  (born November 15, 1907, Jettingen, Germany—died July 20, 1944, Berlin) German army officer who, as the chief conspirator of the July Plot, carried out an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.
Claus, Count Schenk von Stauffenberg, entered the German army in 1926 and won distinction as a staff officer with a panzer (armoured) division in the campaigns in Poland and northern France (1939–40). After he was transferred to the front in the Soviet Union, however, he became disillusioned with the German occupation’s brutal policies toward Slavs and Jews. At his own request, he was transferred to the North African campaign, where he was a staff officer in a panzer division. In that campaign he was severely wounded (losing his left eye, right hand, and two fingers of his left hand) in April 1943.
