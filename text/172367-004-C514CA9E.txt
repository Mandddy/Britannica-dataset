Invasion of the Body Snatchers, American science-fiction film, released in 1956, that was directed by Don Siegel and has been hailed as one of the most intelligent films of the genre.
In the small California town of Santa Mira, several patients of Dr. Miles Bennell (played by Kevin McCarthy) claim that their loved ones have been replaced by impostors. Bennell initially diagnoses those patients as suffering from a mass delusion. Soon, however, he discovers that Santa Mira is really being quietly invaded by aliens who grow in seedpods and take over peopleâ€™s bodies while they sleep. The extraterrestrial intruders look and sound just like their victims except that they are devoid of any human emotion or feeling.
