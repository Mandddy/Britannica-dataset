Jimmie Lunceford, in full James Melvin Lunceford   (born June 6, 1902, Fulton, Miss., U.S.—died  July 12, 1947, Seaside, Ore.) American big band leader whose rhythmically appealing, well-disciplined orchestra was one of the most influential of the swing era.
During his youth, Lunceford studied music with Wilberforce J. Whiteman, father of bandleader Paul Whiteman, and became proficient on all reed instruments. He earned a degree from Fisk University (Nashville, Tenn.) and pursued graduate studies at the City College of New York, after which he taught music and athletics at a high school in Memphis, Tenn. There he formed a student band in 1927 that featured several talented young players who stayed with the band when it turned professional in 1929. After four years of grueling road work, the band attained popularity with prestigious engagements at New York’s Lafayette Theatre and Cotton Club in 1933–34. By this time, the celebrated arranger Sy Oliver was the principal architect of the band’s wide-ranging palette of sounds.
