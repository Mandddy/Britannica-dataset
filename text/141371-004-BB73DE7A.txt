Robert Bridges, in full Robert Seymour Bridges  (born October 23, 1844, Walmer, Kent, England—died April 21, 1930, Boar’s Hill, Oxford) English poet noted for his technical mastery of prosody and for his sponsorship of the poetry of his friend Gerard Manley Hopkins.
Born of a prosperous landed family, Bridges went to Eton College and then to Oxford, where he met Hopkins. His edition of Hopkins’ poetry that appeared in 1916 rescued it from obscurity.
