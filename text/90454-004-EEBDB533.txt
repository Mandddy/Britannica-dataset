Amos Oz, original name Amos Klausner   (born May 4, 1939, Jerusalem) Israeli novelist, short-story writer, and essayist in whose works Israeli society is unapologetically scrutinized.
Oz was educated at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the University of Oxford. He served in the Israeli army (1957â€“60, 1967, and 1973). After the Six-Day War in 1967, he became active in the Israeli peace movement and with organizations that advocated a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In addition to writing, he worked as a part-time schoolteacher and labourer.
