Cookie, (from Dutch koekje, diminutive of koek, “cake”), primarily in the United States, any of various small sweet cakes, either flat or slightly raised, cut from rolled dough, dropped from a spoon, cut into pieces after baking, or curled with a special iron. In Scotland the term cookie denotes a small, plain bun.
Probably the most popular cookies in the United States are those that are based on a simple dough of flour, butter, sugar, and egg, to which a variety of flavouring and texturizing ingredients, such as chocolate chips, oatmeal, raisins, or peanut butter, may be added. More delicate, decorative, or exotically flavoured cookies, such as macaroons, fruited pastries, and gingerbread men, are traditionally associated with baking done for holidays, particularly Christmas.
