Wesleyan University was founded in 1831 by a group of Methodists led by educator-clergyman Wilbur Fisk, who became its first president. Its early curriculum emphasized science, modern languages, and literature as well as the traditional education in the classics. A master’s degree program was first offered in 1889, and doctoral degree programs were developed in the 1960s. Since its founding, the university has been committed to nonsectarian education; its first non-Methodist faculty member (1888–90) was Woodrow Wilson. Noteworthy alumni of Wesleyan include the poet Charles Olson and scientists Wilber Olin Atwater, G. Brown Goode, and Albert Francis Blakeslee.
