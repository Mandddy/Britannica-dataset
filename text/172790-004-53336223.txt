Geno Auriemma, byname of Luigi Auriemma  (born March 23, 1954, Montella, Italy) Italian-born American basketball coach who led the University of Connecticut women’s team to a record 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championships between 1995 and 2016 and to an unprecedented six undefeated seasons.
Auriemma’s family immigrated to Norristown, Pennsylvania, when he was seven years old. While attending West Chester State College (now West Chester University of Pennsylvania), Auriemma took an assistant coach position with the women’s team at St. Joseph’s University in nearby Philadelphia. After graduating in 1981, Auriemma joined the coaching staff at the University of Virginia. In 1985—with no previous head coaching experience—he was hired as the Connecticut head coach. He quickly remade Connecticut, which had just one winning season in its history before Auriemma took over, into one of the premier programs in the country. After posting a 12–15 record in his first year with the Huskies, Auriemma led the team to winning records in each successive season of his tenure.
