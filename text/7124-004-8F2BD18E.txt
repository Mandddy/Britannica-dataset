Baldassare Castiglione,  (born December 6, 1478, Casatico, near Mantua [Italy]—died February 2, 1529, Toledo [Spain]) Italian courtier, diplomat, and writer best known for his dialogue Il libro del cortegiano (1528; The Book of the Courtier).
The son of a noble family, Castiglione was educated at the humanist school of Giorgio Merula and Demetrius Chalcondyles, and at the court of Ludovico Sforza in Milan. He returned to Mantua in 1499 to enter the service of the marquis, Francesco Gonzaga, transferring to the service of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino, in 1504. Among his duties was a mission to England to receive the Order of the Garter as a proxy for Guidobaldo. It was at Urbino that Castiglione collaborated with his cousin on a pastoral drama, Tirsi, in which the speeches of nymphs and shepherds conceal references to the court. Castiglione was sent to Rome in 1513 as ambassador of the new duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria della Rovere, and later entered papal service. He knew the master painter and architect Raphael and collaborated with him on a memorandum regarding the preservation of the city’s antiquities. Castiglione was posted to Spain as papal nuncio (ambassador) in 1525 and apparently impressed Emperor Charles V as a perfect gentleman.
