Social settlement, also called settlement house, community centre, or neighbourhood house,  neighbourhood social welfare agency. The main purpose of a settlement is the development and improvement of a neighbourhood or cluster of neighbourhoods. It differs from other social agencies in being concerned with neighbourhood life as a whole rather than with providing selected services. The staff of a social settlement works with individuals and families and with groups. They do informal counseling and home visiting. They sponsor friendship clubs, classes, athletic teams, and interest or hobby groups. Where problems are such that specialized skill is needed, caseworkers, psychologists, psychiatrists, home economists, and vocational counselors may be employed.
The settlement movement began with the founding of Toynbee Hall, in London in 1884. Samuel Augustus Barnett, then vicar of St. Jude’s Parish, invited a number of university students to join him and his wife in “settling” in a deprived area of the city. The movement spread to the United States when Charles B. Stover and an American lecturer at the West London Ethical Society, Stanton Coit, an early visitor to Toynbee Hall, established Neighborhood Guild, now University Settlement, on the Lower East Side of New York City, in 1886. In Chicago, in 1889, Jane Addams bought a residence on the West Side that came to be known as Hull House. In the same year the educator Jane E. Robbins and Jean Fine (Mrs. Charles B. Spahr) opened the College Settlement, in New York City. Two years later Robert A. Woods, another resident of Toynbee Hall, and William J. Tucker established Andover House, later called South End House, in Boston. The movement then spread to most countries of western Europe and to Southeast Asia and Japan.
