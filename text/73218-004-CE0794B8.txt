Mir, Soviet/Russian modular space station, the core module (base block) of which was launched into Earth orbit by the U.S.S.R. in 1986. Over the next decade additional modules were sent aloft on separate launch vehicles and attached to the core unit, creating a large habitat that served as a versatile space laboratory for more than 14 years.
Mir (Russian: “Peace” or “World”) was the third generation of space stations developed by the Soviet Union. Its core module resembled its simpler predecessors in the Salyut series but had additional docking ports (a total of six) that accommodated not only a succession of manned spacecraft and cargo ferries but also permanently attached expansion modules equipped for scientific research.
