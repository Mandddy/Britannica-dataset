John Huston, in full John Marcellus Huston  (born August 5, 1906, Nevada, Missouri, U.S—died August 28, 1987, Middletown, Rhode Island) American motion-picture director, writer, and actor whose taut dramas were among the most popular Hollywood films from the early 1940s to the mid-1980s. Many of his films were literary adaptations or tough action tales with an existential spin. Indeed, his own life—in which Huston starred as a boxer, painter, horseman, gadabout, rebel, and international ladies’ man (who married six times)—was at least as engaging as many of his movies.
Huston was born in a small town in Missouri that his grandfather claimed to have won in a poker game. Huston’s father, Walter Huston, had given up stage acting for work as a civil engineer that took his family to Texas and Indiana before he decided to return to acting in 1909. Within a few years Huston’s parents were divorced, and he spent his childhood moving between his father, who initially returned to vaudeville, and his mother, Reah, who worked as a journalist and taught him to both ride and bet on horses. Although he suffered from kidney disease and an enlarged heart, Huston overcame a frail, often bedridden youth to become so robust a teenager that he was the amateur lightweight boxing champion of California (with a distinctive broken nose to show for it). After briefly studying painting in Los Angeles, Huston moved to New York City in 1924 to become an actor and performed with the Provincetown Players in Greenwich Village. In 1925, while vacationing in Mexico, he became an honorary member of the Mexican cavalry.
