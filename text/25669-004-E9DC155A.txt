Pliohippus, extinct genus of horses that inhabited North America during the Pliocene Epoch (5.3–2.6 million years ago). Pliohippus, the earliest one-toed horse, evolved from Merychippus, a three-toed horse of the preceding Miocene Epoch (23–5.3 million years ago). The teeth of Pliohippus are taller and more complexly folded than those of earlier horses; these features indicate a greater dependence on grazing than browsing for food. Because of its diet and its specializations for running, it is likely that Pliohippus lived on open plains.
