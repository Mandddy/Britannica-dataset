Giulietta Masina, in full Giulia Anna Masina  (born February 22, 1921, San Giorgio di Piano, near Bologna, Italy—died March 23, 1994, Rome) Italian motion-picture actress and the wife of Italian film director Federico Fellini. Her portrayal of waiflike innocents served as the emotional focal point for some of Fellini’s best films.
Masina began acting in student theatre productions when she was in her teens. Although she enrolled as a student at the University of Rome in 1938, she continued to devote a good deal of time to acting in university plays and on radio. In 1939 she made her professional debut in an Italian translation of Thornton Wilder’s Happy Traveler. By 1943 Masina was gaining notice as a radio actress and had been cast as Pallina in Cico e Pallina, a radio serial about a young married couple written by Fellini. Soon after, on October 30, 1943, she and Fellini were married.
