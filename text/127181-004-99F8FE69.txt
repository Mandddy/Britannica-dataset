Frank-Walter Steinmeier,  (born Jan. 5, 1956, Detmold, W.Ger.) German Social Democratic Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands; SPD) politician who in the early 21st century served as vice-chancellor (2007–09) and foreign minister (2005–09) of Germany in a grand coalition government led by Angela Merkel of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (Christlich-Demokratische Union; CDU).
Steinmeier was the son of a carpenter and a factory worker. As a student, he attended meetings of the Young Socialists, the SPD’s youth wing, regularly, and, after finishing high school in Blomberg in 1974, he joined the SPD. In 1980 he received a law and politics degree from the University of Giessen, where he joined the faculty in 1986 while working on his doctoral dissertation (1991) on state intervention and homelessness. He left academia shortly thereafter and turned to politics.
