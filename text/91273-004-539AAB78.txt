Fiona Wood, in full Fiona Melanie Wood  (born February 2, 1958, Hernsworth, Yorkshire, England) British-born Australian plastic surgeon who invented “spray-on skin” technology for use in treating burn victims.
Wood was raised in a mining village in Yorkshire. Athletic as a youth, she had originally dreamed of becoming an Olympic sprinter before eventually setting her sights on a medical career. She graduated from St. Thomas’s Hospital Medical School in London in 1981 and worked for a time at a British hospital. Wood then proceeded to earn her primary fellowship (1983) and fellowship (1985) from the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). She moved to Perth in 1987 after marrying surgeon Tony Keirath, a native of Western Australia. She became Western Australia’s first female plastic surgeon, after earning her fellowship from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) in plastic and reconstructive surgery (1991). In 1992 Wood became head of the burn unit at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH), which moved its facilities to Fiona Stanley Hospital in 2014. She also served as a clinical professor at the School of Paediatrics and Child Health at the University of Western Australia and directed the McComb Research Foundation (now the Fiona Wood Foundation), which she founded in 1999.
