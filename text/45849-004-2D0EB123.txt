Red Grange, byname of Harold Edward Grange  (born June 13, 1903, Forksville, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 28, 1991, Lake Wales, Florida) American collegiate and professional gridiron football player and broadcaster. He was an outstanding halfback whose spectacular long runs made him one of the most famous players of the 20th century. He was an important influence in popularizing professional football.
Grange was a star football player at Wheaton (Illinois) High School before entering the University of Illinois in 1922. There he played football during the 1923–25 seasons and was selected as an All-American halfback each season. He became a national idol in 1924 when he turned in one of the most sensational single-day performances by an athlete in sports history. Against a highly rated Michigan team, Grange ran for touchdowns of 95, 67, 56, and 44 yards in the first quarter of play. In the second half he scored a fifth touchdown and threw a touchdown pass in a 39–14 Illinois victory. Grange was nicknamed the “Galloping Ghost” for his blinding speed and elusive running style.
