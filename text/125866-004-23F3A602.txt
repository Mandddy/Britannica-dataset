Bacon, a side of a pig that, after removal of the spare ribs, is cured, either dry or in pickle, and smoked. Some varieties, notably Canadian bacon, are cut from the loin portion of the pork, which is more lean.
Bacon was for centuries the staple meat of the western European peasantry. Varieties distinguished by cut of meat or curing process became standardized in association with particular countries or regions, such as the Irish or various Italian styles. The relatively long storage life of bacon made it the only meat to gain importance as an international trade commodity in the late 19th century.
