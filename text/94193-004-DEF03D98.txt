Grand Teton National Park, spectacular glaciated mountain region in northwestern Wyoming, U.S. It lies just south of Yellowstone National Park (to which it is connected by the John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway) and north of the city of Jackson; the National Elk Refuge adjoins the park’s far southeastern boundary. In 1950 most of Jackson Hole National Monument (established 1943) was incorporated into the park, which itself had been established in 1929; the park now covers 484 square miles (1,254 square km).
The park encompasses much of the Teton Range and most of Jackson Hole, a fertile valley just to the east of the Tetons, through which runs the Snake River. The snow-covered and glacially scoured peaks of the range—whose highest point is Grand Teton, 13,770 feet (4,198 metres) above sea level—tower some 7,000 feet (2,130 metres) above Jackson Hole. The steep, rugged mountains give way to the morainic landscape of the valley, which is dotted with glacial lakes of varying sizes. The best-known of these is Jenny Lake, which lies at the base of the tallest peaks, and the largest is Jackson Lake, formed by a dam across the Snake River.
