Antônio Gonçalves Dias,  (born Aug. 10, 1823, Boa Vista, near Caxias, Maranhão, Braz.—died Nov. 3, 1864, off the coast of Maranhão) Romantic poet generally regarded as the national poet of Brazil. His “Canção do Exílio” (1843; “Song of Exile”), beginning “Minha terra tem palmeiras” (“My land has palm trees”), is known to every Brazilian schoolchild.
Though Gonçalves Dias lived much of the time abroad following his education at the University of Coimbra in Portugal, his songs, published as Primeiros Cantos (1846; “First Poems”), Segundos Cantos (1848; “More Poems”), and Últimos Cantos (1851; “Last Poems”), continually celebrated, with exuberance and longing, the New World as a tropical paradise. He was himself of the common Brazilian racial mixture—Portuguese, Indian, and African—that Brazilians consider to be the source of their distinctive temperament.
