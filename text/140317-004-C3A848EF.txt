Richard Manning Karp,  (born Jan. 3, 1935, Boston, Mass., U.S.) American mathematician and computer scientist and winner of the 1985 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for “his continuing contributions to the theory of algorithms including the development of efficient algorithms for network flow and other combinatorial optimization problems, the identification of polynomial-time computability with the intuitive notion of algorithmic efficiency, and, most notably, contributions to the theory of NP-completeness.” His research interests have included theoretical computer science, combinatorial algorithms, discrete probability, computational biology, and Internet algorithms.
Karp earned a bachelor’s degree (1955), a master’s degree (1956), and a doctorate (1959), all in mathematics, from Harvard University. After finishing his studies, he worked as a mathematician at IBM (1959–68) before moving to academia. Karp held positions at the University of California, Berkeley (1968–94), the University of Washington (1995–99), and again at Berkeley (1999– ), where he returned as a University Professor.
