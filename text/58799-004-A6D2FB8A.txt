Cardiac catheterization, medical procedure by which a flexible plastic tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery or vein. It is used for injecting drugs for therapy or diagnosis, for measuring blood flow and pressure in the heart and central blood vessels, in performing procedures such as angiography (X-ray examination of the arteries and veins) and angioplasty (a procedure used to dilate obstructed arteries), and as a means of passing electrodes into the heart to study, restore, or regulate the heartbeat. Catheterization is central to the diagnosis, therapy, and surgical management of many forms of cardiovascular disease.
The term cardiac catheterization was coined in 1844 by French physiologist Claude Bernard, who inserted a glass catheter into the heart of a horse. The procedure was first performed in a human by German physician Werner Forssmann, who in 1929 opened a vein in his own arm, inserted a urethral catheter about 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) in diameter and 76 cm (2.5 feet) long, and passed it to the right side of his heart while photographing his accomplishment with an X-ray machine. In the United States, physiologists André Cournand and Dickinson Richards developed clinical applications of Forssmann’s technique, and in 1956 the three shared a Nobel Prize for their achievements.
