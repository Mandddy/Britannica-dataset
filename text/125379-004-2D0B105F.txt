Kŭm River, Korean Kŭm-gang,  river, southwestern South Korea. It rises east of Chŏnju in North Chŏlla do (province) and flows north-northwest through North Ch’ungch’ŏng do, where it turns southwest and empties into the Yellow Sea at Kunsan. The Kŭm River is 249 miles (401 km) long and is navigable for 81 miles (130 km; as far as Puyŏ). It is located in an area of fertile plains and gold deposits. The 1,624-foot- (495-metre-) long Taechong multipurpose dam, on a branch of the Kŭm River, was completed in 1980. It supplies the cities around its middle course (Ch’ŏngju, Nonsan, and Kanggyŏng) with water and with electricity.
