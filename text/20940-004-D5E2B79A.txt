Isaac Singer, in full Isaac Merritt Singer  (born October 27, 1811, Pittstown, New York, U.S.â€”died July 23, 1875, Torquay, Devon, England) American inventor who developed and brought into general use the first practical domestic sewing machine.
At the age of 19 Singer became an apprentice machinist, and in 1839 he patented a rock-drilling machine. Ten years later he patented a metal- and wood-carving machine. While working in a Boston machine shop in 1851, Singer was asked to repair a Lerow and Blodgett sewing machine; 11 days later he had designed and built an improved model, which he patented and sold through I.M. Singer &amp; Company. The first to embody features allowing continuous and curved stitching, his machine employed an overhanging arm holding the needle bar over a horizontal table, thus making it possible to sew on any part of the work. His basic design features have been followed in almost all subsequent machines.
