German wirehaired pointer, breed of sporting dog developed in mid-19th-century Germany as an all-purpose, all-weather hunting dog. It generally has a keen “nose” and a rugged constitution. It stands 22 to 26 inches (56 to 66 cm), weighs 50 to 70 pounds (23 to 32 kg), and has a deep chest and a short, strong back. Its straight, harsh, white and liver-coloured outer coat covers a dense undercoat, which is heavy in winter and very thin in summer.
