Rose Cecil O’Neill,  (born June 25, 1874, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 6, 1944, Springfield, Missouri) American illustrator, writer, and businesswoman remembered largely for her creation and highly successful marketing of Kewpie characters and Kewpie dolls.
O’Neill grew up in Battle Creek, Michigan, and in Omaha, Nebraska. The attention she earned with a prizewinning drawing for the Omaha World-Herald, created when she was 14, inspired her to sell other drawings to the newspaper and to the Great Divide magazine of Denver, Colorado. In 1893 she moved to New York City, where she sold drawings to Truth, Puck, Cosmopolitan, and other magazines. In 1896 she married Gray Latham (divorced 1901). During the marriage she signed her work “O’Neill Latham.” In 1902 she married the editor of Puck, Harry Leon Wilson (divorced 1907), and she illustrated several of his books. In addition to her illustrations for Good Housekeeping, Life, Collier’s, and other leading magazines, which brought her a substantial income, she wrote the novels The Loves of Edwy (1904) and The Lady in the White Veil (1909).
