Shetland sheepdog, also called Sheltie ,  small working dog developed as a herd dog for the small sheep of the Shetland Islands, Scotland. The dog resembles the rough-coated collie but in miniature, and like the collie it is descended from an old breed of Scottish working dog. Characteristically sturdy and agile, the Shetland sheepdog is noted for its herding ability and affectionate nature. For show purposes the American Kennel Club recognizes only those dogs that are 13 to 16 inches (33 to 41 cm) high at the shoulder. The long, straight coat is black, brown, or blue-gray with black mottling and may be marked with tan and white.
