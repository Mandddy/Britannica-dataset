William Hayley,  (born Oct. 29, 1745, Chichester, Sussex, Eng.—died  Nov. 12, 1820, Felpham, near Chichester) English poet, biographer, and patron of the arts.
Hayley is best remembered for his friendships with William Blake, the great pre-Romantic poet, painter, and designer, and with the 18th-century poet William Cowper. He was also a patron of less well-known writers, including the poet and novelist Charlotte Smith. Hayley is also recalled for his well-meant but destructive patronage of George Romney, a painter whom he persuaded to continue the “drudgery of face-painting” when Romney would have preferred to paint ideal subjects.
