Battleship,  capital ship of the worldâ€™s navies from about 1860, when it began to supplant the wooden-hulled, sail-driven ship of the line, to World War II, when its preeminent position was taken over by the aircraft carrier. Battleships combined large size, powerful guns, heavy armour, and underwater protection with fairly high speed, great cruising radius, and general seaworthiness. In their ultimate development they were able to hit targets with great precision at a range of more than 20 miles (30 km) and to absorb heavy damage while remaining afloat and continuing to fight.
The battleship type had its genesis in the Gloire, a French oceangoing ironclad displacing 5,600 tons that was launched in 1859. (The Gloire and similar ships of combined sail and steam propulsion were given various names such as armoured frigate or steam frigate; the term battleship did not become current until some years later.) In 1869 HMS Monarch became the first oceangoing iron-hulled battleship. In place of broadside guns fired through portholes in the hull, this vessel mounted four 12-inch guns in two revolving turrets on the main deck. Over the following decades, battleships dispensed with auxiliary sail power. They adopted a mixed armament of large-calibre turret guns of 10 to 12 inches for long-range battle with other capital ships, medium guns of 6 to 8 inches for close range, and small guns of 2 to 4 inches for beating back torpedo boats.
