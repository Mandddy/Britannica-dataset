Giambattista della Porta, also called Giovanni Battista Della Porta   (born 1535?â€”died February 4, 1615, Naples [Italy]) Italian natural philosopher whose experimental research in optics and other fields was undermined by his credulous preoccupation with magic and the miraculous.
Della Porta founded the Accademia dei Segreti, which was later suppressed by the Inquisition, and in 1610 he took part in the reconstitution of the Accademia dei Lincei. He traveled widely in Italy, France, and Spain.
