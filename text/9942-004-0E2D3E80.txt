Moloch, also called thorny devil (Moloch horridus),  small (20-centimetre- [8-inch-] long), squat, orange and brown Australian lizard of the Old World family Agamidae. Moloch is entirely covered with thornlike spines, the largest projecting from the snout and over each eye. The shape of its body and many of its habits are similar to those of horned lizards of North America, which are in the family Iguanidae. Both are flattened, have short tails, spines, move very little, and specialize on ants.
The moloch is an inhabitant of sandy deserts, where it feeds on black ants. Even though it is a slow-moving reptile, individuals often move 200â€“300 metres each day. This harmless reptile is extremely difficult to find in its natural habitat, partly because of its cryptic coloration and morphology and partly because it remains perfectly still when approached. The best way to find one is to follow its tracks in the sand.
