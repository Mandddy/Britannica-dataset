Killdeer,  (Charadrius, sometimes Oxyechus, vociferus), American bird that frequents grassy mud flats, pastures, and fields. It belongs to the plover family of shorebirds (Charadriidae, order Charadriiformes). The killdeerâ€™s name is suggestive of its loud insistent whistle. The bird is about 25 centimetres (10 inches) long, with a brown back and a white belly, and it has two black breast bands (instead of one, as in other ringed plovers). In flight it shows a black and white wing pattern and a brown tail.
Killdeers breed throughout North America and in northwestern South America (and a few regularly visit Iceland and western Europe). They migrate only to escape snow, returning in spring before most songbirds. Killdeers are the ecologic equivalent of the lapwings of Europe. They eat beetles, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and other insects.
