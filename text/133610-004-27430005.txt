Otto Friedrich von Gierke,  (born Jan. 11, 1841, Stettin, Prussia—died  Oct. 10, 1921, Berlin) legal philosopher who was a leader of the Germanist school of historical jurisprudence in opposition to the Romanist theoreticians of German law (e.g., Friedrich Karl von Savigny). An incomplete knowledge of his work led some advocates of a pluralistic, decentralized political system to claim him as their spokesman.
Gierke was a professor at Breslau (1871–84), Heidelberg (1884–87), and Berlin (1887–1921). He criticized the first draft (1888) of a new German civil law code for what he considered the gratuitous addition of Roman law elements to an indigenous Germanic content that was sufficient in itself. This controversy inspired his Deutsches Privatrecht, 3 vol. (1895–1917; “German Private Law”).
