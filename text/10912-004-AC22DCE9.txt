A.E. Housman, in full Alfred Edward Housman  (born March 26, 1859, Fockbury, Worcestershire, Eng.â€”died  April 30, 1936, Cambridge) English scholar and celebrated poet whose lyrics express a Romantic pessimism in a spare, simple style.
Housman, whose father was a solicitor, was one of seven children. He much preferred his mother; and her death on his 12th birthday was a cruel blow, which is surely one source of the pessimism his poetry expresses. While a student at Oxford, he was further oppressed by his dawning realization of homosexual desires. These came to focus in an intense love for one of his fellow students, an athletic young man who became his friend but who could not reciprocate his love. In turmoil emotionally, Housman failed to pass his final examination at Oxford, although he had been a brilliant scholar.
