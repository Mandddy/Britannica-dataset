Sesshū,  original surname Oda, also called Tōyō, Unkoku, or Bikeisai  (born 1420, Akahama, Bitchū province, Japan—died  Aug. 26, 1506, near Masuda, Iwami province) artist of the Muromachi period, one of the greatest masters of the Japanese art of sumi-e, or monochrome ink painting. Sesshū adapted Chinese models to Japanese artistic ideals and aesthetic sensibilities. He painted landscapes, Zen Buddhist pictures, and screens decorated with birds, flowers, and animals. His style is distinguished for its force and vehemence of brush stroke as well as by its intensity of conception.
In contrast to many of the masters of Japanese art about whose lives little is known, the biography and artistic career of Sesshū are recorded in detail. His family name was Oda; his original personal name is no longer known. In 1431, at the age of 10, he was enrolled at the local Zen temple, known as Hofuku Temple, where he received the name Tōyō, meaning “willowlike” (perhaps because he was slender and graceful). Zen Buddhist temples were the artistic and cultural centres of the period as well as the centres of spiritual life. As a young novice, therefore, Sesshū undoubtedly received not only religious guidance but also instruction in calligraphy and painting.
