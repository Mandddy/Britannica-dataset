Billy Sunday, byname of William Ashley Sunday   (born Nov. 19, 1862/63, Ames, Iowa, U.S.—died  Nov. 6, 1935, Chicago) American evangelist whose revivals and sermons reflected the emotional upheavals caused by transition from rural to industrial society in the United States.
Sunday grew up as an orphan and worked as an undertaker’s assistant before entering professional baseball in 1883. In 1891 he gave up baseball to become a YMCA worker but turned in 1896 to conducting religious revivals in major American cities. Ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1903, Sunday was theologically a Fundamentalist. Following the lead of the American evangelist Dwight L. Moody, and with the aid of a choir director named Homer A. Rodeheaver and a score of revival “specialists,” he conducted more than 300 revivals with an estimated attendance of 100,000,000.
