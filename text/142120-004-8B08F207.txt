Sámos, Greek island in the Aegean Sea, the closest one to the mainland of Asia Minor, from which it is separated by the narrow Sámos Strait. The 184-sq-mi (476-sq-km) island is wooded and mountainous; Mount Kerketeus, the highest peak (4,701 ft [1,433 metres]), forms the western tip of the island. The east coast is amply indented, but the smoother south coast has broad, deep plains except around the port of Tigáni, which is hemmed in by hills. With Ikaría and the Foúrnoi islands, it forms the nomós (department) of Sámos, whose capital, Vathí, is at the head of a narrow, deepwater bay on the north coast.
The island’s earliest settlers were of obscure origins, but there is evidence of Early Neolithic occupancy on the south coast, near Tigáni. About the 11th century bce the Ionians appeared, and by the 7th century the island was one of the leading commercial centres of Greece, trading with Black Sea peoples, Egypt, Cyrene (Libya), Corinth, and Chalcis and becoming a bitter rival of Miletus.
