Dame Julie Andrews, original name Julia Elizabeth Wells  (born Oct. 1, 1935, Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, Eng.) English motion-picture, stage, and musical star noted for her crystalline four-octave voice and her charm and skill as an actress.
At the age of 10, Andrews began singing with her pianist mother and singer stepfather (whose last name she legally adopted) in their music-hall act. Demonstrating a remarkably powerful voice with perfect pitch, she made her solo professional debut in 1947 singing an operatic aria in Starlight Roof, a revue staged at the London Hippodrome.
