Grover Cleveland Alexander, byname Old Pete  (born February 26, 1887, Elba, Nebraska, U.S.—died November 4, 1950, St. Paul, Nebraska) American professional baseball player, one of the finest right-handed pitchers in the history of the game, frequently considered the greatest master of control. From 1911 to 1930 he won 373 major league games and lost 208. Alexander pitched for three National League (NL) teams during his major league career: the Philadelphia Phillies (1911–17, 1930), the Chicago Cubs (1918–26), and the St. Louis Cardinals (1926–29).
Alexander grew up on a farm, where his daily labours helped him develop the strength and endurance that were to become hallmarks of his pitching. He defied his father’s wishes that he study law and instead took a job as a telephone lineman so he could play baseball on the weekends. In 1909 Alexander began playing semiprofessionally, and his stellar pitching drew the attention of the Phillies, who brought him to the major leagues in 1911.
