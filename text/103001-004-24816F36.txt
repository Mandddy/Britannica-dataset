Brad Mehldau, byname of Bradford Alexander Mehldau  (born August 23, 1970, Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.) American jazz pianist whose incorporation of rock elements into his performances made him one of the most influential jazz artists of his generation.
Like many notable jazz pianists, Mehldau was originally classically trained. He began studying piano at age six, and he became interested in jazz in his early teens. He played in the noted Hall High School jazz band in Hartford, Connecticut, and then studied jazz in New York City at the New School, graduating in 1993; there his teachers included jazz pianists Junior Mance, Fred Hersch, and Kenny Werner. After taking high-profile sideman jobs in New York City, Mehldau played (1994â€“95) with the quartet led by tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman. Mehldau also accompanied top musicians in jazz, country, and rock music. He played on four film sound tracks before composing the score for another film, Ma femme est un actrice (2001).
