Baul, member of an order of religious singers of Bengal known for their unconventional behaviour and for the freedom and spontaneity of their mystical verse. Their membership consists both of Hindus (primarily Vaishnavites, or followers of Lord Vishnu) and Muslims (generally Sufis, or mystics). Their songs frequently deal with the love between the human personality and a personal god, who resides within the individual. Little is known of the development of the cult, as their songs began to be collected and written down only in the 20th century. Rabindranath Tagore was one of many Bengali authors who acknowledged an indebtedness of inspiration to Baul verse.
