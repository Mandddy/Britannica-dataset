Cathy Freeman, byname of Catherine Astrid Salome Freeman  (born February 16, 1973, Mackay, Queensland, Australia) Australian sprinter who excelled in the 400-metre dash and who in 2000 became the first Australian Aborigine to win an individual Olympic gold medal.
Freeman began competitive running on the advice of her stepfather. At age 17 she won a gold medal at the 1990 Commonwealth Games as a member of the 4 × 100-metre relay team and was named Young Australian of the Year. In 1992 she became the first Australian Aborigine to compete in the Olympic Games. Although she failed to win a medal, Freeman’s profile continued to grow, and she brought new attention to Aborigines, who had historically encountered discrimination. At the 1994 Commonwealth Games she captured gold medals in the 400-metre and 200-metre races, setting a national record in the 200 metres at 22.2 seconds, and also won a silver medal in the 4 × 100-metre relay. A succession of impressive victories in 1995, including a rare win against rival Marie-José Pérec of France, earned Freeman the number two world ranking for 400 metres. She held that ranking the following year, when she became the first Australian woman to break 50 seconds at 400 metres, which she did seven times in race finals.
