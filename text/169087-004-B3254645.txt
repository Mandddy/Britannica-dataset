John Paul I, Latin Johannes Paulus, original name Albino Luciani  (born October 17, 1912, Forno di Canale, Italy—died September 28, 1978, Rome) pope whose 33-day pontificate in 1978 was the shortest in modern times. He was the first pope to choose a double name and did so in commemoration of his two immediate predecessors, John XXIII and Paul VI. He was the first pope in centuries who refused to be crowned, opting instead for the simple pallium of an archbishop, and he was known affectionately as “The Smiling Pope” on account of the smile he often displayed in public.
Born of a poor family, Luciani was ordained a priest in 1935. Appointed deputy director of the seminary in the Belluno diocese, he taught moral theology, canon law, and sacred art. He earned a doctorate in sacred theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1947 and was made vicar-general of his diocese the following year. He remained concerned with the teaching of church doctrine and wrote Catechetica in briciole (1949; “Catechism in Crumbs”) in order to instruct less-educated Roman Catholics.
