Judd Gregg, in full Judd Alan Gregg  (born Feb. 14, 1947, Nashua, N.H., U.S.) American politician who served as a Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives (1981–89), as governor of New Hampshire (1989–93), and as a member of the U.S. Senate (1993–2011).
Gregg graduated from the elite Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965 and earned a B.A. in English from Columbia University in 1969. After receiving a law degree (1972) and an LL.M. in tax law (1975) from Boston University, he entered private practice as an attorney in Nashua, N.H. He began his political career in 1978, when he was elected to New Hampshire’s executive council. He served one term (1979–81) on the council, which shared executive power with the state’s governor. In 1980 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and he took his seat the following year, representing New Hampshire’s 2nd congressional district. Gregg served four terms before launching a successful campaign for governor, an office he held from 1989 to 1993. He returned to Congress in 1993, this time as a senator, and he established a reputation as a fiscal conservative who tracked toward the centre on social issues. In 2006, for example, he was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.
