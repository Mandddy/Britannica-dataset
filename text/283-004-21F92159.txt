Wien’s law, also called Wien’s displacement law,  relationship between the temperature of a blackbody (an ideal substance that emits and absorbs all frequencies of light) and the wavelength at which it emits the most light. It is named after German physicist Wilhelm Wien, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1911 for discovering the law.
Wien studied the wavelength or frequency distribution of blackbody radiation in the 1890s. It was his idea to use as a good approximation for the ideal blackbody an oven with a small hole. Any radiation that enters the small hole is scattered and reflected from the inner walls of the oven so often that nearly all incoming radiation is absorbed and the chance of some of it finding its way out of the hole again can be made exceedingly small. The radiation coming out of this hole is then very close to the equilibrium blackbody electromagnetic radiation corresponding to the oven temperature. Wien found that the radiative energy dW per wavelength interval dλ has a maximum at a certain wavelength λm and that the maximum shifts to shorter wavelengths as the temperature T is increased. He found that the product λmT is an absolute constant: λmT = 0.2898 centimetre-degree Kelvin.
