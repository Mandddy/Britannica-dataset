Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert,  (born 1522, Amsterdam—died  Oct. 29, 1590, Gouda, Neth.) Dutch poet, translator, playwright, and moralist who set down Humanist values for the first time in the vernacular. His clear, unpretentious prose style contrasted with that of the contemporary Rederijkers (rhetoricians) and served as a model to the great 17th-century Dutch writers. His book of songs Liedekens (1575) shows his determination to choose a form for the content and not vice versa.
Coornhert settled in Haarlem as an engraver on copper. Holding positions in the city’s government, he threw himself into the struggle against Spanish rule and drew up the manifesto of William of Orange (1566). He was imprisoned at The Hague (1568) but escaped to Cleves. Although he was recalled to Haarlem in 1572 and became secretary to the States of Holland, his aversion to warfare led him back to Cleves, where he continued in William’s employ.
