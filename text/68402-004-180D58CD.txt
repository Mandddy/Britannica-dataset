Tanker, ship designed to carry liquid cargo in bulk within its cargo spaces, without the use of barrels or other containers. Most tankers carry either crude oil from oil fields to refineries or petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, fuel oil, or petrochemical feedstock from refineries to distribution centres. Some tankers with special food-grade holds, pumps, and other handling equipment can carry molasses, edible oil, and even wine in bulk. Specialized ships for transporting liquefied natural gas and fruit juices are often called tankers, though on these ships the cargo is actually carried in large refrigerated containers that fit into the hold.
Crude-oil and petroleum-product tankers vary in size from small coastal vessels about 60 metres (200 feet) long, carrying from 1,500 to 2,000 deadweight tons (dwt), up to huge vessels that reach lengths of more than 400 metres (1,300 feet), carry as much as 550,000 dwt, and are the largest ships afloat. (Deadweight is the total weight of cargo plus such necessary supplies as fuel, lubricating oil, crew, and the crewâ€™s life support.) Between these two extremes are various size classes, though the exact specifications for each class vary among sources. Common tanker designations, in descending order by size, are:Ultralarge crude carriers (ULCCs). The very largest ships, these have a length in the neighbourhood of 415 metres (1,350 feet) and a capacity of 320,000 to more than 550,000 dwt. They carry from two million to well more than three million barrels of crude.Very large crude carriers (VLCCs). These ships, with a length of some 330 metres (1,100 feet), have capacities between 200,000 and 320,000 dwt. They carry in the area of two million barrels.Suezmax. The largest ships that can transit the Suez Canal, these tankers are some 275 metres (900 feet) long and have a capacity of 120,000 to 200,000 dwt. They carry about 800,000 to more than 1,000,000 barrels.Aframax. The maximum size of vessel to use the Average Freight Rate Assessment method for calculating shipping rates, these tankers are around 240 metres (790 feet) long and have capacities of 80,000 to 120,000 dwt. They carry roughly 500,000 to 800,000 barrels.Panamax. The maximum size that can transit the Panama Canal, these tankers range in length between 200 and 250 metres (650 and 820 feet) and have capacities of 50,000 to 80,000 dwt. They carry 350,000 to 500,000 barrels.Handymax, Handysize, Coastal, and other classes. These ships have capacities of less than 50,000 dwt and lengths up to approximately 200 metres (650 feet).
