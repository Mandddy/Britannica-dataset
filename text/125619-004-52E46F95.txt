Tahini,  paste of crushed sesame seeds that is widely used in Middle Eastern cooking. Tahini mixed with garlic, lemon juice, and salt and thinned with water constitutes taratoor, a sauce that is eaten as a dip with Arab bread as part of a selection of meze, or hors d’oeuvres. Taratoor is mixed with ground chickpeas for hummus bi tahini, another hors d’oeuvre dip. Baba ganooj combines mashed roast eggplant with taratoor and onions. Tahini is also used as a sauce ingredient for fish and vegetable dishes.
