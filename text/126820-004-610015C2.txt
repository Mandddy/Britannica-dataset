Byllye Avery, in full Byllye Yvonne Avery  (born 1937, DeLand, Florida, U.S.) American health care activist whose efforts centred on bettering the welfare of low-income African American women through self-help groups and advocacy networks.
Avery studied psychology at Talledega (Alabama) College (B.A., 1959) and received an M.A. in special education from the University of Florida (1969). She devoted herself to the education of emotionally disturbed children, first as a teacher and then as a consultant to the state of Florida. Her husband’s sudden death at age 33 was the catalyst for Avery’s commitment to improving the health of the African American community; she focused particularly on women who, like herself, had a high level of stress in their lives. Self-help groups for African American women facing poverty, crime, violence, and racism were the cornerstones of her activism.
