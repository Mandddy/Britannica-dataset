Derby, also called the Epsom Derby and the Derby Stakes,  one of the five classic English horse races, along with the Saint Leger, the Oaks, the One Thousand Guineas, and the Two Thousand Guineas. With a field limited to three-year-old colts and fillies, the Derby is run on turf on the first Saturday in June over a 1 1/2-mile (about 2,400-metre) course at Epsom Downs, Surrey, England.
The first recorded race on the Downs dates to 1661, and there were annual races there by 1730. At a 1778 social gathering including Sir Charles Bunbury and Edward Stanley, the 12th earl of Derby, the group conceived the idea of a race on the Downs for three-year-old fillies, which was subsequently called “the Oaks” after the name of Derby’s nearby estate. Derby’s horse Bridget won the first running of the Oaks in 1779. At a celebration after the race, Bunbury and Derby suggested a similar race for both colts and fillies, to begin the following year. Reputedly, a coin toss followed, and Derby won the honour of naming the race after himself. Bunbury’s horse Diomed won the first running of the Derby on May 4, 1780. Many other horse races have since been named after the Derby (most notably the Kentucky Derby), and the term itself has come to signify a race or contest of any type.
