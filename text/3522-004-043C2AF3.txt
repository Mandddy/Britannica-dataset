Germain Pilon,  (born 1535, Paris, France—died  Feb. 3, 1590, Paris) French sculptor whose work, principally monumental tombs, is a transitional link between the Gothic tradition and the sculpture of the Baroque period.
A sculptor’s son, Pilon was employed at age 20 on the decoration of the tomb of King Francis I at Saint-Denis. His earlier work clearly shows an Italian influence, but eventually he developed a more distinctively French expression by fusing elements from classical art, Gothic sculpture, and Michelangelo with the Fontainebleau adaptation of Mannerism, a style characterized by subjective conceptions, studied elegance, and virtuoso artifice.
