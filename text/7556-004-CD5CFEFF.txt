Eldridge Cleaver, in full Leroy Eldridge Cleaver  (born 1935, Wabbaseka, near Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.â€”died May 1, 1998, Pomona, California) American black militant whose autobiographical volume Soul on Ice (1968) is a classic statement of black alienation in the United States.
Cleaver was an inmate of correctional institutions in California almost constantly from his junior high school days until 1966 for crimes ranging from possession of marijuana to assault with intent to murder. While in prison, he supplemented his incomplete education with wide reading and became a follower of the Black Muslim separatist Malcolm X. He also began writing the essays that would eventually be collected in Soul on Ice, and whose publication in Ramparts magazine helped him win parole in 1966.
