Niagara, county, northwestern New York state, U.S. It consists of a lowland region bounded to the north by Lake Ontario, to the west by Ontario, Can. (the Niagara River constituting the border), and to the south by Tonawanda Creek, which is incorporated into the Erie Canal (itself part of the New York State Canal System). Among the other waterways are Power Reservoir and Eighteenmile and Johnson creeks. Niagara Falls, a cataract on the Niagara River between New York and Ontario, is one of North America’s best-known natural wonders and an important source of hydroelectric power for both the United States and Canada. The falls are surrounded by parklands—including Niagara Falls State Park, New York’s oldest state park (established 1885). Among the other state parks are Whirlpool, Devil’s Hole, Wilson-Tuscarora, and Golden Hill. Oak trees predominate in wooded areas.
Tuscarora Indians, an Iroquoian-speaking tribe, arrived in the 1770s, Seneca and Erie Indians having previously inhabited the area. A number of Tuscarora now live on a reservation in the county. The region was of strategic importance during colonial times; Old Fort Niagara (extant buildings dating from 1725–26) was alternately controlled by the French, British, and American armies. Niagara University was founded in 1856.
