Freestyle skiing, winter sport that combines skiing and acrobatics. The sport has experimented with a range of events, but there are two that have been constant through the course of the sport’s international competition: aerials and moguls.
Somersaults and other tricks were exhibited before 1914 and became popular meet additions in the early 1920s. Such stunts performed in the air (now called aerials) were developed in the 1950s, especially by Olympic gold medalist Stein Eriksen. Currently there are two varieties: upright and inverted. Flips or any movements where a competitor’s feet are higher than his head are not allowed in upright competition. Instead, the skier performs such jumps as the daffy (one ski extended forward, the other backward) or the spread eagle. In inverted competition contestants execute flips and somersaults, often reaching heights of 12.2 to 15.2 metres (40 to 50 feet). The skiers build up speed on the inrun, which leads to various ramps and a landing hill with an incline of 34°–39° and a length of 30 metres (100 feet). Based on the degree of difficulty, the routine is scored on form and technique (50 percent), takeoff and height (20 percent), and landing (30 percent).
