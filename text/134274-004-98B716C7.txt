Roland Burris, in full Roland Wallace Burris  (born Aug. 3, 1937, Centralia, Ill., U.S.) American Democratic politician who was the first African American elected to statewide office in Illinois. His appointment as U.S. senator (2009–10) to fill the seat vacated by Pres. Barack Obama made him the fourth African American to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction.
Burris grew up in downstate Illinois, and he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from Southern Illinois University in 1959. He received a law degree from Howard University in 1963, and, after moving to Chicago, became a bank examiner for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. He left the job a year later to work in the tax division of Continental Illinois, then one of the 10 largest banks in the United States. While there, he made his first foray into politics, with a failed bid for the Illinois House of Representatives in 1968. Having risen to the rank of vice president, Burris left the bank in 1973 to join the cabinet of Illinois Gov. Dan Walker. After an unsuccessful campaign for state comptroller in 1976, he worked as director of Jesse Jackson’s Operation PUSH in 1977. In 1978 Burris ran again for state comptroller, this time winning and becoming the first African American to be elected to statewide office in Illinois.
