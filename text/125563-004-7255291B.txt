Francisco de Miranda,  (born March 28, 1750, Caracas, Venez.—died  July 14, 1816, Cádiz, Spain) Venezuelan revolutionary who helped to pave the way for independence in Latin America. His own plan for the liberation of Spain’s American colonies with the help of the European powers failed, but he remains known as El Precursor—i.e., “the forerunner” of Bolívar and other more effective revolutionaries.
Educated in Caracas, Miranda purchased a captaincy in the Spanish army at the age of 22. He was imprisoned for disobedience but was released in 1780 and sent to Cuba to fight against Great Britain. There he was accused of misuse of funds. Protesting his innocence, he fled to the United States in 1783.
