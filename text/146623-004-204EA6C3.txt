Drilling machinery,  equipment used to drill holes in the ground for such activities as prospecting, well sinking (petroleum, natural gas, water, and salt), and scientific explorations. Drilling holes in rock to receive blasting charges is an operation in tunneling, mining, and other excavating.
Most modern drilling machines are either percussive (chipping rock or ground intermittently by impact) or rotary (involving a cutting or grinding action). A combined rotary-percussive drill uses both types of action when the hardness of the stratum warrants it.
