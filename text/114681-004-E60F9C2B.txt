Conseil d’État, (French: “Council of State”), highest court in France for issues and cases involving public administration. Its origin dates back to 1302, though it was extensively reorganized under Napoleon and was given further powers in 1872. It has long had the responsibility of deciding or advising on state issues and legislative measures submitted to it by the sovereign or, later, by the president, the cabinet, or the parliament. It is the court in which French citizens may bring claims against the administration, though usually since 1953 such claims originate in the regional administrative tribunals of first instance, and appeals are taken to the Conseil d’État. Progressively since 1987 certain appeals have been dealt with by seven new administrative appeal courts based in major cities. These courts are controlled by the Conseil d’État. Institutions imitative of the French Conseil d’État have been established in many other countries, such as Belgium, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Spain, Turkey, and Egypt.
