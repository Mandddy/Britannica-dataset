Bringing Up Baby, American screwball comedy film, released in 1938, that is widely considered a classic of its genre.
The zany narrative begins when eccentric heiress Susan Vance (played by Katharine Hepburn) meets and repeatedly embarrasses bookish paleontologist Dr. David Huxley (Cary Grant) while he is attempting to impress the representative of a potential donor to the museum where he works. Though David tells Susan that he is scheduled to get married the next day, she decides to pursue him anyway. In the morning, she persuades him to help her take care of a pet leopard named Baby that her brother has sent from Brazil. After David grudgingly agrees to drive Susan, with Baby in the backseat, to the Connecticut home of her aunt Elizabeth (May Robson), a number of farcical events ensue. For example, David is forced to wear a woman’s dressing gown; Susan’s dog steals and buries a rare dinosaur bone David has been carrying; and Susan uncages a vicious circus leopard that she has mistaken for Baby. Eventually the pair winds up in jail, though they are soon released. Sometime later Susan visits the museum to return the bone and promises David a $1 million donation, upon which David—whose fiancée has left him—relents and declares his love for her.
