Eugene McCarthy, in full Eugene Joseph McCarthy, also called Eugene J. McCarthy  (born March 29, 1916, Watkins, Minnesota, U.S.—died December 10, 2005, Washington, D.C.) U.S. senator, whose entry into the 1968 race for the Democratic presidential nomination ultimately led President Lyndon B. Johnson to drop his bid for reelection.
McCarthy graduated from St. John’s University (Collegeville, Minnesota) in 1935, then taught high school while working on a master’s degree at the University of Minnesota. He returned as a faculty member to St. John’s (1940–43) and subsequently served in the War Department’s military intelligence division until the end of World War II. After the war McCarthy again taught school, eventually becoming chairman of the sociology department at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1948 he ran successfully on Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party ticket for the U.S. House of Representatives, where he remained for 10 years, compiling a liberal voting record.
