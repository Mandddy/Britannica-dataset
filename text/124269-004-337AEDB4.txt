Robert C. Merton,  (born July 31, 1944, New York, N.Y., U.S.) American economist known for his work on finance theory and risk management and especially for his contribution to assessing the value of stock options and other derivatives. In 1997 Merton shared the Nobel Prize for Economics with Myron S. Scholes, whose option valuation model, the Black-Scholes formula (developed with economist Fischer Black), provided the foundation for much of Merton’s work. (Upon his death in 1995, Black became ineligible for the Nobel Prize, which is not awarded posthumously.)
After studying engineering mathematics at Columbia University (B.S., 1966) and applied mathematics at the California Institute of Technology (M.S., 1967), Merton turned to the study of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Ph.D., 1970). He taught at MIT’s Sloan School of Management from 1970 until 1988, when he joined the faculty of the Harvard Business School. In addition to his academic duties, he served on the editorial boards of numerous economic journals and as a principal member of Long-Term Capital Management—an investment firm he cofounded and in which Scholes was also a partner—which failed in 1998. Merton wrote many economic treatises, as well as the book Continuous-Time Finance (1990).
