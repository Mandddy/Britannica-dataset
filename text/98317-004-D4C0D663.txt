Uneven parallel bars, also called asymmetrical parallel bars,  gymnastics apparatus developed in the 1930s and used in women’s competition. The length and construction are the same as for the parallel bars used in men’s gymnastics. The top bar is 2.4 metres (7.8 feet) above the floor, while the lower bar is 1.65 metres (5.4 feet) high. The apparatus was first used in international competition at the 1936 Olympic Games. It allows a great variety of movements, although hanging and swinging exercises predominate. The performer strives for smoothness and equal use of both bars in her routine.
