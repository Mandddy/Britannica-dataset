Fisher (Martes pennanti), also called fisher marten, fisher cat, Pennant’s marten, Pennant’s cat, big marten, black fox, black cat, or Pekan ,  rare North American carnivore of northern forests, trapped for its valuable brownish black fur (especially fine in the female). It is a member of the weasel family (Mustelidae). The fisher has a weasellike body, bushy tail, tapered muzzle, and low, rounded ears. Adults are usually 50–63 cm (20–25 inches) long, excluding the 33–42-centimetre tail, and weigh 1.4–6.8 kg (3–15 pounds). Males are larger and heavier than the females. The fisher hunts both on the ground and in trees, attacking various rodents (including porcupines) and other animals. Its diet also consists of fruits and sometimes nuts. A litter contains one to five young, born after a gestation period of 338–358 days, including a delay before implantation of the fertilized egg in the wall of the uterus.
