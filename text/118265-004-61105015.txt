Gordonia, any of some 70 species in the genus Gordonia of the tea family (Theaceae). The genus is native to North America and East Asia and includes the loblolly bay and other trees with yellow-centred, white, camellia-like blooms. The loblolly bay, or tan bay (G. lasianthus), native to southeastern North America, reaches about 19 metres (60 feet). It has ascending branches, an oval form, evergreen leaves, and long-stalked, fragrant flowers in late summer. An evergreen species from South China, G. axillaris, has stalkless blossoms 10 cm (4 inches) wide that flower in winter on evergreen trees, which sometimes are up to 7 metres (22.5 feet) tall. The franklinia tree, which was once included in Gordonia, is now called Franklinia alatamaha.
