Fighter aircraft, aircraft designed primarily to secure control of essential airspace by destroying enemy aircraft in combat. The opposition may consist of fighters of equal capability or of bombers carrying protective armament. For such purposes fighters must be capable of the highest possible performance in order to be able to outfly and outmaneuver opposing fighters. Above all, they must be armed with specialized weapons capable of hitting and destroying enemy aircraft.
Fighter airplanes have been described by a variety of labels. Early in World War I they were used as scout planes for artillery spotting, but it was quickly discovered that they could be armed and do combat with one another, shoot down enemy bombers, and conduct other tactical missions. Since that time fighters have assumed various specialized combat roles. An interceptor is a fighter whose design and armament best fit it for intercepting and defeating or routing invading fighters. A night fighter is one equipped with sophisticated radar and other instruments for navigating in unfamiliar or hostile territory at night. A day fighter is an airplane in which weight and space are saved by eliminating the special navigational equipment of the night fighter. The air supremacy, or air superiority, fighter must have long-range capability, to enable it to travel deep into enemy territory to seek out and destroy enemy fighters. Fighter-bombers fill the dual role suggested by their name.
