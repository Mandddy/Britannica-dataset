She Done Him Wrong, American romantic comedy film, released in 1933, that helped establish both Mae West and Cary Grant as major movie stars.
The film is set in 1890s Manhattan and centres on Lady Lou (played by West), who works at a saloon and is the mistress of its crooked owner, Gus Jordan (Noah Beery, Sr.). As Gus’s criminal activities begin to fall under the suspicion of a candidate for sheriff (David Landau), Lou falls for Captain Cummings (Cary Grant), a mission worker who frequents the bar. After a manic string of events that leads Lou to inadvertently kill one of Gus’s accomplices, the saloon is raided by Cummings, who reveals that he is an undercover policeman. Lou is apprehended along with Gus and several others, but once they are outside, Cummings escorts her to a coach, where he presents her with a diamond ring.
