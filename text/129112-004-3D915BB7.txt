Minuteman,  in U.S. history, an American Revolution militiaman who agreed to be ready for military duty “at a minute’s warning.”
The first minutemen were organized in Worcester county, Massachusetts, in September 1774, when revolutionary leaders sought to eliminate Tories from the old militia by requiring the resignation of all officers and reconstituting the men into seven regiments with new officers. One-third of the members of each regiment were to be ready to assemble under arms at instant call and were specifically designated “minutemen.” Other counties began adopting the same system, and, when Massachusetts’ Provincial Congress met in Salem in October, it directed that the reorganization be completed. The first great test of the minutemen was at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775. On July 18, 1775, the Continental Congress recommended that other colonies organize units of minutemen; Maryland, New Hampshire, and Connecticut are known to have complied.
