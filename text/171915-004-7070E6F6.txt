Alexis Piron,  (born July 19, 1689, Dijon, France—died January 21, 1773, Paris) French dramatist and wit who became famous for his epigrams and for his comedy La Métromanie (1738; “The Poetry Craze”).
Piron was secretary to a banker and then studied law. In 1719 he moved to Paris, where he worked as a copyist, struggling meanwhile to enter the world of letters. After Arlequin Deucalion (1722) and other successful pieces written for the popular Théâtres de la Foire, Piron produced Les Fils ingrats (“The Ungrateful Sons”) at the Comédie-Française in 1728. La Métromanie, a witty, urbane comedy portraying himself as a young poet intoxicated with literary aspirations, remains his most-distinguished play; it was revived at the Comédie-Française until well into the 19th century. His tragedies included the moderately successful Gustave Wasa (1733). Having achieved a modest fame, Piron acquired noble patrons and the entree to several literary salons but continued to live an independent, carefree life and became known for his ready wit and his epigrams.
