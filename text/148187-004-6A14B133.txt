Conidium, a type of asexual reproductive spore of fungi (kingdom Fungi) usually produced at the tip or side of hyphae (filaments that make up the body of a typical fungus) or on special spore-producing structures called conidiophores. The spores detach when mature. They vary widely in shape, colour, and size, large ones being called macroconidia, small ones, microconidia.
