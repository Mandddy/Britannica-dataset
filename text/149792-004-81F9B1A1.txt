Saschiz, village and commune, Mureș județ (county), central Romania. The villages of Saschiz, Mihai Viteazu, and Cloașterf make up the larger commune of Saschiz. Located in the old region of Transylvania, it lies about 12 miles (20 km) east of Sighișoara.
First documented in the 14th century, Saschiz is known for its medieval fortress and church constructed by Transylvanian Saxons, a population of German speakers who settled in Transylvania when it was part of Hungary. The ruins of the 14th-century fortress sit atop a hill overlooking the village. The late 15th-century fortified church has Gothic details and an imposing clock tower. Along with five other villages with fortified churches (Prejmer, Viscri, Dârjiu, Câlnic, and Valea Viilor), Saschiz was inscribed on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage sites in 1999. (Another such village, Biertan, had been the first to be so inscribed, in 1993.)
