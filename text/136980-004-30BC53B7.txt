Selenga River, Mongolian Selenge Mörön,  river in Mongolia and east-central Russia. It is formed by the confluence of the Ider and Delger rivers. It is Mongolia’s principal river and is the most substantial source of water for Lake Baikal.
The Delger rises in the Sangilen Mountains on the border between Mongolia and the Russian republic of Tyva (Tuva), and the headwaters of the Ider lie in the Hangayn Mountains in Mongolia to the south. From their confluence the Selenga flows northeast to receive the Orhon River at Sühbaatar. It continues north into Russia and bends eastward to Ulan-Ude, capital of Buryatia. From there the river flows north to Tataurovo, where it swings westward and then flows through a delta into Lake Baikal. From Sühbaatar to its mouth the Selenga flows down a gentle slope, giving Mongolia access to the plains of Siberia (Asiatic Russia). The Trans-Siberian Railroad follows the river’s valley upstream to Ulan-Ude, where a branch continues to Sühbaatar, and then up the Orhon to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia.
