Kiki Smith,  (born January 18, 1954, NÃ¼rnberg, Germany) German-born American sculptor, installation artist, and printmaker whose intense and expressionistic work investigated the body and bodily processes.
The daughter of the American actress and opera singer Jane Lawrence and the American architect and sculptor Tony Smith, she was born in Germany, where her mother had launched a career in opera. The family returned to the United States in 1955, and Smith was raised in South Orange, New Jersey. After briefly attending the Hartford Art School, she moved to New York in 1976. Her work as a sculptor bore little resemblance to that of her father. Where he was abstract and nonfigurative, she was engaged in the study of human anatomy and the natural world.
