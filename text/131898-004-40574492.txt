Wax sculpture,  the preparation of finished figures in beeswax by modelling or molding or the use of such figures as a form for casting metal or creating preliminary models. At ordinary temperatures beeswax can be cut and shaped with facility; it melts to a limpid fluid at a low heat; it mixes with any colouring matter and takes surface tints well; and its texture and consistency may be modified by a number of earthy matters as well as by the addition of oils or fats.
Wax figures of deities were used in the funeral rites of the ancient Egyptians and deposited in their graves; many of these are now in museums. Among the ancient Greeks wax figures were used largely as dolls for children. Statuettes of deities were also modelled for votive offerings and religious ceremonies, and wax images to which magical properties were attributed were treasured by the people. Wax figures and models held a still more important place among the Romans. The masks (effigies, or imagines) of ancestors, modelled in wax, were preserved by patrician families and were displayed on ceremonial occasions and carried in funeral processions. The closing days of the Saturnalia were known as Sigillaria because of the custom of making, toward the end of the festival, presents of wax models of fruit and waxen statuettes that were fashioned by the sigillarii, manufacturers of small figures in wax and other media. The practice of wax modelling can be traced through the Middle Ages, when votive offerings of wax figures were made to churches, and the memories of monarchs and great personages were preserved by wax masks. Malice and superstition were also expressed in the formation of wax images of hated persons, into the bodies of which long pins were thrust in the hope that deadly injury would be induced in the person represented. Belief in this form of black magic never died out completely.
