Field Museum, in full Field Museum of Natural History,  museum in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., established in 1893 as the Columbian Museum of Chicago with a gift from Marshall Field, from whom in 1905 it derived its present name. It was established to house the anthropological and biological collections of the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. On Field’s death in 1906, he bequeathed generous sustaining funds and a sum to erect a new museum building (completed in 1921) to house exhibits, research collections, and a library primarily devoted to anthropology, botany, geology, and zoology.
The American naturalist Carl E. Akeley, a member of the staff from 1895 to 1909, invented new methods of taxidermy and began the practice of displaying stuffed animals in dioramas—painted and modeled scenes of their natural habitats. The Field Museum’s research library contains more than 250,000 volumes. The museum houses some 20 million items in its research and display collections. Exhibits include Sue, the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the world; Inside Ancient Egypt, which includes mummies and artifacts; Underground Adventure, a walk-through display on soil and underground life; and the Grainger Hall of Gems. The museum also engages in research and education programs.
