Sir Alexander James Edmund Cockburn, 10th Baronet,  (born Dec. 24, 1802—died  Nov. 21, 1880, London, Eng.) lord chief justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench from June 24, 1859, and lord chief justice of England from 1874 until his death. He was the first to be legally styled lord chief justice of England, a title used informally by lord chief justices of King’s or Queen’s Bench since Edward Coke’s tenure (1613–16).
Of distinguished Scottish-French ancestry, Cockburn (pronounced co′burn) was an amiable man of considerable intellectual attainments. Called to the bar in 1829, he earned a high reputation as a trial lawyer and as a reporter of cases. He served as a member of the House of Commons (1847–56), solicitor general (1850–51), attorney general (1851–56), and chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas (1856–59) before Prime Minister Lord Palmerston appointed him to the Queen’s Bench. He inherited the baronetcy from an uncle in 1858.
