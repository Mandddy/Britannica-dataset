Nouvelle artificial intelligence, an approach to artificial intelligence (AI) pioneered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Laboratory by the Australian American scientist Rodney Brooks during the latter half of the 1980s. Nouvelle AI distances itself from strong AI, with its emphasis on human-level performance, in favour of the relatively modest aim of insect-level performance. At a very fundamental level, nouvelle AI rejects symbolic AI’s reliance upon constructing internal models of reality. Practitioners of nouvelle AI assert that true intelligence involves the ability to function in a real-world environment.
A central idea of nouvelle AI is that intelligence, as expressed by complex behaviour, “emerges” from the interaction of a few simple behaviours. For example, a robot whose simple behaviours include collision avoidance and motion toward a moving object will appear to stalk the object, pausing whenever it gets too close.
