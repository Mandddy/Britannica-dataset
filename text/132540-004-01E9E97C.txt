Pliny the Younger, Latin in full Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus   (born ad 61/62, Comum [Italy]â€”died c. 113, Bithynia, Asia Minor [now in Turkey]) Roman author and administrator who left a collection of private letters of great literary charm, intimately illustrating public and private life in the heyday of the Roman Empire.
Born into a wealthy family and adopted by his uncle, Pliny the Elder, Pliny began to practice law at 18. His reputation in the civil-law courts placed him in demand in the political court that tried provincial officials for extortion. His most notable success (100) was securing condemnation of a governor in Africa and a group of officials from Spain. Meanwhile he had attained the highest administrative posts, becoming praetor (93) and consul (100).
