Vibrio,  (genus Vibrio), any of a group of comma-shaped bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae. Vibrios are aquatic microorganisms, some species of which cause serious diseases in humans and other animals.
Vibrios are microbiologically characterized as gram-negative, highly motile, facultative anaerobes (not requiring oxygen), with one to three whiplike flagella at one end. Their cells are curved rods 0.5 μm (micrometre; 1 μm = 10-6 metre) across and 1.5 to 3.0 μm long, single or strung together in S-shapes or spirals.
