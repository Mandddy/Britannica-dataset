Otto Wagner,  (born July 13, 1841, Penzing, near Vienna—died  April 11, 1918, Vienna) Austrian architect and teacher, generally held to be a founder and leader of the modern movement in European architecture.
Wagner’s early work was in the already-established Neo-Renaissance style. In 1893 his general plan (never executed) for Vienna won a major competition, and in 1894 he was appointed academy professor.
