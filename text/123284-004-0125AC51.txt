Film festival, gathering, usually annual, for the purpose of evaluating new or outstanding motion pictures. Sponsored by national or local governments, industry, service organizations, experimental film groups, or individual promoters, the festivals provide an opportunity for filmmakers, distributors, critics, and other interested persons to attend film showings and meet to discuss current artistic developments in film. At the festivals distributors can purchase films that they think can be marketed successfully in their own countries.
The first festival was held in Venice in 1932. Since World War II, film festivals have contributed significantly to the development of the motion-picture industry in many countries. The popularity of Italian films at the Cannes and Venice film festivals played an important part in the rebirth of the Italian industry and the spread of the postwar Neorealist movement. In 1951 Kurosawa Akiraâ€™s Rashomon won the Golden Lion at Venice, focusing attention on Japanese films. That same year the first American Art Film Festival at Woodstock, New York, stimulated the art-film movement in the United States.
