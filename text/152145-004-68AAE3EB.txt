Besós River, Spanish Río Besós,  river, northeastern Spain. The river begins in the Catalonian mountain range where the Congost River joins the Mogent River. The Besós then flows 25 miles (40 km) south and southeast into the Mediterranean Sea, north of Barcelona city. The final part of the river courses through a heavily industrialized area of greater Barcelona. For decades, this section of the Besós was one of the most polluted river areas in Catalonia, but a wastewater treatment system installed in the 1990s has improved its condition. A series of inflatable dams control the water flow in the lower Besós, and several small parks line this portion of the river.
