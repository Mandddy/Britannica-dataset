Emily Davies, in full Sarah Emily Davies  (born April 22, 1830, Southampton, Hampshire, England—died July 13, 1921, Hampstead, London) English pioneer in the movement to secure university education for women and chief founder of Girton College, Cambridge. She was responsible for University College, London, admitting women to classes in 1870 for the first time.
Educated at home, Davies joined the campaign for the emancipation of women with Mme Bodichon (Barbara Leigh Smith) and Elizabeth Garrett (Mrs. Garrett Anderson). With Dorothea Beale and Frances Mary Buss, she gave evidence before the school’s inquiry commission (1864–68) with the aim of getting women admitted to university examinations. Unlike her friends, she insisted that women should be admitted on the same terms as men. In 1869 Davies and her friends opened a women’s college at Hitchin, which moved to Cambridge in 1873 as Girton College. She served on the London school board (1870–73), becoming mistress at Girton (1873–75). Among her books were The Higher Education of Women (1866) and Thoughts on Some Questions Relating to Women, 1860–1908 (1910).
