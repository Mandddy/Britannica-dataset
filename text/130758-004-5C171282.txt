Byzantine rite,  the system of liturgical practices and discipline observed by the Eastern Orthodox church and by the majority of Eastern-rite churches, which are in communion with Rome.
The Byzantine rite originated in the Greek city of Antioch (in modern southern Turkey), one of the earliest and most celebrated centres of Christianity; but it was developed and perfected in Byzantium, or Constantinople (Istanbul). The rite was associated primarily with the Great Church of Constantinople and used the Greek language. As Constantinople extended its influence, however, the rite lost its exclusive Greek character and became Byzantine as it was translated into the vernacular of the diverse peoples who adopted it.
