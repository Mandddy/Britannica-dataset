Kaj Munk, in full Kaj Harald Leininger Munk   (born Jan. 13, 1898, Maribo, Den.—died  Jan. 4, 1944, near Silkeborg) Danish playwright, priest, and patriot who was a rare exponent of religious drama with a strong sense of the theatre. He revived the “heroic” Shakespearean and Schillerian drama with writing whose passionate quality is not often found among Danish writers.
Munk studied at the University of Copenhagen, where he began his first produced play, En idealist (1928; Eng. trans. Herod the King). This was originally misunderstood by the critics, although it was acclaimed 10 years later.
