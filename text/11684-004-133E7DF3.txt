Fritillary, any ornamental plant of the genus Fritillaria of the family Liliaceae, consisting of about 80 species of bulbous, mostly perennial herbs, native primarily to the North Temperate Zone. Members of the genus have bell-shaped nodding flowers that usually are solitary. The leaves alternate along the stem or are in whorls. A nectar gland is present at the base of each of the six parts of the flower.
In many species the flower has a checkered appearance. The fruit is a three-valved capsule with many seeds. Snakeâ€™s head, or toad lily (F. meleagris), a species with poisonous bulbs, and crown imperial (F. imperialis), a strong-smelling plant, are commonly cultivated as garden flowers.
