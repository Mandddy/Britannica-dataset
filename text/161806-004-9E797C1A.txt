Walter Jackson Freeman II,  (born November 14, 1895, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 31, 1972) American neurologist who, with American neurosurgeon James W. Watts, was responsible for introducing to the United States prefrontal lobotomy, an operation in which the destruction of neurons and neuronal tracts in the white matter of the brain was considered therapeutic for patients with mental disorders. Freeman’s use of and public advocacy for the procedure and others like it made him a controversial figure.
Freeman’s father, Walter Jackson Freeman, was an otolaryngologist (an ear, nose, and throat doctor), and his maternal grandfather, William Williams Keen, was a prominent surgeon. Freeman did not express a strong interest in medicine in his youth, but, after receiving a bachelor’s degree in 1916 from Yale University, he enrolled as a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania and earned a medical degree (1920). He subsequently worked as an intern in pathology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and in 1923 traveled to Europe to study neurology. Upon his return to the United States the following year, Freeman took a position as the director of laboratories at Saint Elizabeths Hospital, then a leading psychiatric institution in Washington, D.C. Freeman’s initial perception of the hospital’s patient wards was marked in part by disgust and fear. Later he described mental disorders and the fate of affected individuals as a social tragedy, and he came to believe that such disorders arose from organic causes, such as abnormal neuronal function, rather than from unconscious mental processes, as was emphasized by psychoanalysis.
