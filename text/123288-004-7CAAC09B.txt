Ejnar Mikkelsen,  (born Dec. 23, 1880, Vester-Brønderslev, Den.—died  May 3, 1971, Copenhagen) Danish polar explorer and author.
Mikkelsen went to sea at the age of 14. He was inspired by dreams of polar exploration, and at age 16 he walked the 320 miles (515 km) from Stockholm to Gothenburg in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade S.A. Andrée to take him on the latter’s Arctic balloon flight. In 1900, however, G.C. Amdrup took him on the Danish expedition to east Greenland. In 1901–02 Mikkelsen was a member of the Baldwin-Ziegler expedition to Franz Josef Land. He served as chief officer of the international hydrographic expedition to the North Atlantic in 1903–04. He then led the Anglo-American polar expedition (1906–08); his sledge journey of several hundred miles over the ice of the Beaufort Sea established that, contrary to previous reports, there was no land north of Alaska. He described this expedition in Conquering the Arctic Ice (1909).
