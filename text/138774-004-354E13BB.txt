Ubangi River, also spelled Oubangui River,  largest right-bank tributary of the Congo River, marking the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville). The Ubangi is formed by the union (near Yakoma, Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border of the Central African Republic) of the Bomu (Mbomou) and Uele (Welle) rivers, and it then flows west for about 350 miles (560 km). It bends northeast of Bangui and flows a somewhat longer distance southwest. The total length of the Ubangi, with the Uele, is approximately 1,400 miles (2,250 km). Its mean discharge at Bangui is estimated at 151,147 cubic feet (4,280 cubic metres) per second. From May to December, when in flood, the discharge may exceed 494,000 cubic feet (14,000 cubic metres), while during low water (February–April) it drops to 35,300 cubic feet (1,000 cubic metres).
In its upper reaches the Ubangi divides into arms separated by elongated islands, while elsewhere confining rocks create rapids, such as those of Bangui. The Ubangi changes on entering the Congo basin, its wide course being split by sandy shoals. Some of its tributaries are still impeded by rapids. The area between longitude 16° E and the Ubangi consists of flat, swampy valleys and low divides descending east and southeast from the western hills to the Congo River. Much of the region is covered with dense equatorial rainforest, and large portions of the region that lie northeast and southwest of the Sangha River are permanently inundated. The Ubangi River joins the Congo at the village of Irebu, at the mouth of the Irebu Channel. Low-lying, swampy Lake Tumba drains through this channel into the Congo River. The Congo waters during late April to late June push back those of the Ubangi. Some clearance for navigation has taken place, and barges of 600 tons can reach Bangui.
