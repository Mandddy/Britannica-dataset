Balthasar Neumann, in full Johann Balthasar Neumann   (born 1687, Eger, Bohemia, Austrian Habsburg domain [now Cheb, Czech Republic]—died August 19, 1753, Würzburg [Germany]) German architect who was the foremost master of the late Baroque style.
Neumann was apprenticed to a bell-founder and in 1711 emigrated to Würzburg, where he gained the patronage of that city’s ruling prince-bishop, a member of the Schönborn family, after working on military fortifications. In 1719 Neumann began directing construction of the first stage of the new Residenz (palace) for the prince-bishop in Würzburg, and he was soon entrusted with the planning and design of the entire structure. Work on the Residenz continued at intervals after Neumann’s own death in 1753, though by the 1740s it had advanced far enough for the painter G.B. Tiepolo to decorate the palace’s enormous ceilings.
