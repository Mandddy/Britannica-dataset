Jim Bridger, byname of James Bridger   (born March 17, 1804, Richmond, Va., U.S.—died  July 17, 1881, near Kansas City, Mo.) American fur trader, frontiersman, scout, the “mountain man” par excellence.
In 1812, Bridger’s father, a surveyor and an innkeeper, moved his family to an Illinois farm near St. Louis, Mo. The young Bridger joined his first fur-trapping expedition in 1822 (that of William H. Ashley and Andrew Henry, up the Missouri River), and for the next 20 years he passed repeatedly on foot through an enormous area whose boundaries were the Canadian border, the Missouri River, the Colorado–New Mexico border, and Idaho and Utah, constantly exploring new territory; he is believed to have been the first white man to visit (1824) Great Salt Lake and was among the first to explore the geysers and sights of the Yellowstone region.
