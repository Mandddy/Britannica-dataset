Weevil (family Curculionidae), also called snout beetle,  true weevil of the insect order Coleoptera (beetles and weevils). Curculionidae is one of the largest coleopteran families (about 40,000 species). Most weevils have long, distinctly elbowed antennae that may fold into special grooves on the snout. Many have no wings, whereas others are excellent fliers. Most are less than 6 mm (0.25 inch) in length, although the largest exceed 80 mm (3 inches). Although most are brown or gray, a few, like the diamond beetle Entimus of Brazil, are brightly coloured.
The majority of weevils feed exclusively on plants. The fleshy, legless larvae of most species feed only on a certain part of a plantâ€”i.e., the flower head, seeds, fleshy fruits, stems, or roots. Many larvae feed either on a single plant species or on closely related ones. Adult weevils tend to be less-specialized in their feeding habits.
