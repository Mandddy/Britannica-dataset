Kob (Kobus kob), small, stocky African antelope (tribe Reduncini, family Bovidae) that occurs in large numbers on floodplains of the northern savanna. The kob ranges from Senegal in the west to the Ethiopian border in the east and southward into western Uganda and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are three distinct subspecies: the western kob (Kobus kob kob), the Uganda kob (K. kob thomasi), and the white-eared kob (K. kob leucotis) of eastern South Sudan.
The kob resembles a heavier impala. Its stocky build with strong legs and overdeveloped hindquarters make for a powerful bounding gallop but not for the fleetness and endurance of slimmer plains antelopes. Females are slender compared with males, which have thick necks and bulging muscles. At 94 kg (207 pounds), bucks weigh one-third more than does and stand 8 cm (3 inches) taller (90–100 cm [35–39 inches]). Armed with heavily ridged lyre-shaped horns 40–69 cm (16–27 inches) long, males stand out in a crowd of hornless females; they also have darker coats that enhance the white throat patch, underparts, eye rings, and insides of ears. Sexual dimorphism reaches its extreme in the white-eared kob, with males the colour of ebony. Male Uganda kob are a rich reddish brown with bold black stripes fronting their legs.
