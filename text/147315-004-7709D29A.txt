Oscillograph,  instrument for indicating and recording time-varying electrical quantities, such as current and voltage. The two basic forms of the instrument in common use are the electromagnetic oscillograph and the cathode-ray oscillograph; the latter is also known as a cathode-ray oscilloscope, which, strictly speaking, is purely an indicating instrument, while the oscillograph can make permanent records.
The operation of an electromagnetic oscillograph, like the operation of a dâ€™Arsonval galvanometer, depends on the interaction of the field of a permanent magnet and a coil of wire through which an electric current is flowing.
