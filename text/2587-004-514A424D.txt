Microphone, device for converting acoustic power into electric power that has essentially similar wave characteristics. While those on telephone transmitters comprise the largest class of microphones, the term in modern usage is applied mostly to other varieties.
Apart from telephone transmitters, microphones are most widely applied in hearing aids, sound-recording systems (principally magnetic and digital tape recorders), dictating machines, and public-address systems. Microphones are extensively used in communications systems, radio or wire, to provide better response quality than with conventional telephone transmitters, or for hands-free operation.
