Gunnar Heiberg, in full Gunnar Edvard Rode Heiberg  (born November 18, 1857, Christiania, Norway—died  February 22, 1929, Oslo) dramatist, exponent of Expressionism, considered the most noteworthy Norwegian playwright after Ibsen.
Left alone as a child when his parents separated, he was educated at King Frederick’s University, Kristiania. Heiberg’s plays were always highly provocative, and their opening nights caused the greatest scandals in the history of Norwegian theatre. Paradesengen (1913) deals with the exploitation of a famous man’s death by his children in such a way that it was clear to contemporary audiences that the dying hero was meant to be the beloved Norwegian writer Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. His political plays, the ironically titled Jeg vil værge mit land (1912; “I Will Defend My Country”) and Folkerådet (1897; “The People’s Council”), were violently booed. In Folkerådet some of the booing was directed against the composer Frederick Delius, who had parodied the national anthem in music written for the play.
