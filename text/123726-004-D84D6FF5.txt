Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever, breed of sporting dog developed in Canada in the 19th century to lure ducks within gunshot range. The dogs toll (entice) the ducks to approach by their antics onshore and retrieve the downed birds for the hunter. The smallest of the retrievers, the “toller” stands 17 to 21 inches (43 to 53 cm) and weighs 43 to 51 pounds (19 to 23 kg). Its thick double coat protects the dog from icy waters; it may be any shade of red, usually with white on the face, chest, feet, and tip of the tail, although some dogs are solid red. The coat may appear wavy on the back; the ears, legs, and especially the tail are well feathered. The Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever has been recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club since 1945 and was registered with the American Kennel Club in 2001; it was classified with the sporting group in 2003. Friendly and energetic, highly trainable, and good with children, it is regarded as a fine family pet.
