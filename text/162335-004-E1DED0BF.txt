Dolores Huerta, née Dolores Fernández  (born April 10, 1930, Dawson, New Mexico, U.S.) American labour leader and activist whose work on behalf of migrant farmworkers led to the establishment of the United Farm Workers of America.
When Huerta was a child she moved to Stockton, California, with her mother and siblings after her parents’ divorce. She remained in touch with her father, Juan Fernández, and took pride in his personal and professional development from coal miner to migrant labourer to union activist to an elected representative in the New Mexico state legislature to college graduate. Unlike many women of her era, she went on to college, after graduating from Stockton High School. Although a brief marriage, motherhood, and divorce interrupted her studies, she eventually received an A.A. degree from Stockton College. A series of unsatisfying jobs led her to seek a teaching credential, but her teaching career lasted only a few months. Huerta decided that she could do more for the hungry and barefoot farmworkers’ children in her class by helping their parents win more equitable working conditions. As an employee of a Mexican-American self-help association called the Community Service Organization (CSO), Huerta lobbied California state legislators to enact such progressive legislation as old-age pensions for noncitizens.
