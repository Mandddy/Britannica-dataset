Dame Helen Mirren, original name Ilynea Lydia Mironoff  (born July 26, 1945, London, England) British actress especially known for her role as Detective Jane Tennison on the television series Prime Suspect (1991–96, 2003, 2006) and for her subtle and sympathetic portrayal of Elizabeth II in The Queen (2006), for which she won an Academy Award.
Mirren was born in London of a Russian-born father and a Scottish mother. (The family’s last name was Mironoff until Helen’s father decided to Anglicize it when she was 10.) She joined Britain’s National Youth Theatre at age 18 and the Royal Shakespeare Company a year later. She spent a large part of the next 15 years working with the latter, appearing in such roles as Cressida in Troilus and Cressida and Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra.
