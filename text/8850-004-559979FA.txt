Veneer,  extremely thin sheet of rich-coloured wood (such as mahogany, ebony, or rosewood) or precious materials (such as ivory or tortoiseshell) cut in decorative patterns and applied to the surface area of a piece of furniture. It is to be distinguished from two allied processes: inlay, in which cutout pieces of decorative wood or other materials—such as metal, leather, or mother-of-pearl—are inset into cavities cut into the main structure of the piece being decorated; and marquetry, or boulle work, which is a more elaborate kind of complex veneering.
There are two main types of veneering, the simplest being that in which a single sheet, chosen for its interesting grain (yew or purple wood, for example), is applied to a whole surface of inferior wood in one unit. In the more complex variation called crossbanding, small pieces of veneer wood are fitted together within a surrounding framework in such a way that the grain changes pattern, thus altering the tone according to the light. This process can produce complex fan shapes, sunbursts, and floral patterns.
