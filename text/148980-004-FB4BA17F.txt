Groupon, American e-commerce company that offers deep discounts, usually 50–90 percent, for popular products and services by using a group discount model. The company’s name is a portmanteau of group and coupon. Groupon was cofounded by Andrew Mason, Eric Lefkofsky, and Brad Keywell in 2008. Headquarters are in Chicago.
Groupon notifies subscribers of daily deals in their chosen home area through e-mail, Facebook posts, Twitter feeds, and mobile phone applications. Offers range from car tune-ups and restaurant purchases to spa packages and theatre tickets. Deals are not official until a predetermined number—which varies on a per-case basis—have been purchased, ensuring that the discount is potentially profitable for the offerer. Subscribers are encouraged to share Groupon offers with their friends via e-mail or social networking sites in order to secure the minimum number of sales. Once an offer has been made official, the customers are charged, and the “groupon” appears in their account. Groupon receives a share of the proceeds, often around half the sale price. Customers may either print out their offers and present them to the merchant or display the vouchers on mobile phones or similar devices. In 2011 Groupon also started offering Groupon Now! deals, which were usually only available for a short span of time on the day of purchase. The site later added sections for purchasing discounted vacations and specific goods.
