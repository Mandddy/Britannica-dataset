Germaine Greer,  (born January 29, 1939, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) Australian-born English writer and feminist who championed the sexual freedom of women.
Greer was educated at the Universities of Melbourne and Sydney before taking a doctorate in 1967 in literature at the University of Cambridge. She acted on television, wrote for journals, and lectured at the University of Warwick until her influential first book, The Female Eunuch (1970), was published. It postulates that passivity in women’s sexuality is a characteristic associated with a castrate, hence the title, and is a role foisted on them by history and by women themselves. Never shy of controversy, Greer debated author Norman Mailer on the topic of women’s liberation in April 1971 at New York City’s Town Hall. The debate was the subject of the 1979 documentary Town Bloody Hall. Greer moved to Italy and continued to lecture, but she later returned to England.
