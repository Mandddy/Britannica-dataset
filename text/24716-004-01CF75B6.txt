Claude Grahame-White,  (born Aug. 21, 1879, Bursledon, Hampshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 19, 1959, Nice, France) English aviator who played a seminal role in early British aviation.
Educated at Bedford in engineering, Grahame-White owned one of the first gasoline-driven motorcars in England and worked at a motor-engineering business in London until he became interested in aeronautics in 1909. On Jan. 4, 1910, he gained the first English aviator’s certificate of proficiency. Also in 1910 he entered many flying races in Europe and in the United States, where he won the Gordon Bennett Cup. In 1911 Grahame-White established the Hendon Aerodrome, near London, and his aviation company trained many British pilots there. That same year he set up the first official English delivery of mail by air. At the outbreak of World War I he was commissioned in the Royal Naval Air Service, but in August 1915 he was recalled to superintend the construction of government planes. He wrote on the history, technical development, and military use of aircraft.
