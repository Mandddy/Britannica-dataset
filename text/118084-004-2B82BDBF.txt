Armillaria, genus of about 35 species of fungi in the order Agaricales (class Agaricomycetes, kingdom Fungi), found throughout northern North America and Europe, principally in forests of hardwoods or mixed conifers. In suitable environments, members of this genus may live for hundreds of years, and certain specimens have been identified as among the largest and oldest living organisms.
From late summer to autumn, Armillaria species produce similar-looking mushrooms, or fruiting bodies, with notched gills extending part way down the stalk and a single or double ring near the base of the cap. The colour ranges from white to golden. Most species are found on the ground, but a few, including the honey mushroom (A. mellea), will grow directly on wood.
