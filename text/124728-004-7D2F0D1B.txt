Owlfly (family Ascalaphidae), any of a group of insects (order Neuroptera) that are frequently mistaken for dragonflies because of their slender bodies and long membranous wings. The adults are found mainly in the tropics but are quite common in the southwestern and southern United States. Owlflies are distinguished from dragonflies by the way in which they fold their wings over the body at rest and by their heavy, clubbed antennae. The larva camouflages itself with debris or hides beneath bark to await prey.
