Rhythmic gymnastics, also called modern gymnastics or modern rhythmic gymnastics,  the performance of systematic physical exercise with the aid of such hand apparatuses as ropes, hoops, balls, clubs, and ribbons. It is closely related to women’s artistic gymnastics—a sport performed on the vaulting horse, uneven parallel bars, balance beam, and floor—and, like synchronized swimming, is allied with dance. The sport dates from the 18th century; and, although some gymnasts participated at the Olympic Games from 1948 to 1956 in individual and group exercises, it was not until the 1984 Olympiad that individual competition became an official competitive event. The 1996 Olympics was the first to include group competition. World championships have been held biannually, in a succession of host cities, since 1963.
An individual routine is performed by one gymnast with one apparatus for 1–11/2 minutes, whereas a group routine is performed by six gymnasts with six pieces of apparatus for 21/2–3 minutes. Both are accompanied by a single musical instrument, usually a piano. The length of the rope used is determined by the height of the individual participant; the plastic or wooden hoop’s interior diameter may vary from 80 to 90 cm (32 to 36 inches); the plastic or rubber ball has a diameter of 18 to 20 cm (7 to 8 inches) and must weigh a minimum of 400 grams (14 ounces); a pair of clubs, 40–50 cm (16–20 inches) long, must each weigh a minimum of 150 grams (5.25 ounces); and the ribbon, a satin strip 4 cm (1.6 inches) wide and 7 metres (23 feet) long, is attached to a slender, flexible wooden stick, or cane, that is 50–60 cm (20–24 inches) in length. The apparatus can be of any colour except gold, silver, or bronze.
