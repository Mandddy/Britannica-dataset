Edward Dmytryk,  (born September 4, 1908, Grand Forks, British Columbia, Canada—died July 1, 1999, Encino, California, U.S.) American motion-picture director whose notable films include Murder, My Sweet (1944), Crossfire (1947), The Caine Mutiny (1954), and The Young Lions (1958). He was one of the Hollywood Ten, a group of film-industry individuals blacklisted for their alleged communist affiliations, and was its only member to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).
Dmytryk was born in Canada, the son of Ukrainian immigrants. The family later moved to California, and Dmytryk became a U.S. citizen in 1939. He began his cinema career as a messenger boy at the Famous Players–Lasky studios (later Paramount) when he was 15, and with Only Saps Work (1930), he edited his first of more than 15 films. During this time he also made his directorial debut with the independently made western The Hawk (1935). In 1939 Paramount made him a full-time director, and his early B-films for the studio included Television Spy (1939) with Anthony Quinn, Golden Gloves (1940), and Mystery Sea Raider (1940). He made Her First Romance at Monogram in 1940 and then moved to Columbia, where he helmed six movies in 1941, including Under Age, a crime drama about reform-school girls who are tricked into working for gangsters, and the horror film The Devil Commands, which starred Boris Karloff as a scientist who attempts to invent a device that allows him to communicate with his dead wife. In 1941 Dmytryk also directed installments in two popular mystery series, Boston Blackie and Lone Wolf.
