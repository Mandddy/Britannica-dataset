Lillian Gish, in full Lillian Diana Gish  (born Oct. 14, 1893, Springfield, Ohio, U.S. [see Researcher’s Note]—died Feb. 27, 1993, New York, N.Y.) American actress who, like her sister Dorothy, was a major figure in the early motion picture industry, particularly in director D.W. Griffith’s silent film classics. She is regarded as one of silent cinema’s finest actresses.
Gish grew up from roughly 1900 in New York City and made her stage debut at age five. During Lillian and Dorothy’s years as child actresses, they formed close friendships with Mary Pickford (then still known as Gladys Mary Smith), who in 1912 introduced them to Griffith. Immediately struck by their beauty and charm, he gave them small parts in a series of silent movies, beginning with An Unseen Enemy (1912), and the next year placed them under contract to his studio. Almost from the start Lillian was the more popular of the two. An extra measure of winsome appeal in such two-reelers as The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912), The Mothering Heart (1913), and Judith of Bethulia (1914) won her a large audience of admirers; and after her appearance in The Birth of a Nation (1915), she was established as one of Hollywood’s top stars. In Intolerance (1916) and Broken Blossoms (1919) she embodied the ideal of the innocent, vulnerable heroine.
