Around the World in Eighty Days, travel adventure novel by Jules Verne, published serially in 1872 in Le Temps as Le Tour du monde en quatre-vingt jours and in book form in 1873.
The lively narrative recounts the journey undertaken by sedentary London gentleman Phileas Fogg and his valet, Passepartout, in order to win a wager with Foggâ€™s fellow club members. Pursued by Fix, a private detective who believes Fogg to be a bank robber, the pair cross three continents and two oceans on trains, steamers, an elephant, and a sail-sledge. Delays and death-defying exploits abound. Assorted companions join the party, including the Hindu widow Aouda, whom Fogg rescues from ritual immolation. In the course of the adventure, Fogg spends or gives away the equivalent of his eventual winnings. Back in London, having met the deadline, convinced Fix of his innocence, and collected the payment, he returns to his former life unchanged but for having Aouda as his bride.
