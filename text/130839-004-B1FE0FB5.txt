Wallraf-Richartz Museum, art collection now housed in a modern building in Cologne, Ger. The strength of the collection, which dates from 1824, lies chiefly in German painting, though it includes fine works from most other western European schools. The museum also has collections of graphic arts and sculpture. In 1957 a research library was opened that now has over 130,000 volumes.
