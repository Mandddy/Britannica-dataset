Charles Brockden Brown,  (born Jan. 17, 1771, Philadelphia—died  Feb. 22, 1810, Philadelphia) writer known as the “father of the American novel.” His gothic romances in American settings were the first in a tradition adapted by two of the greatest early American authors, Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne. Brown called himself a “story-telling moralist.” Although his writings exploit horror and terror, they reflect a thoughtful liberalism.
The son of Quaker parents, Brown was of delicate constitution, and he early devoted himself to study. He was apprenticed to a Philadelphia lawyer in 1787, but he had a strong interest in writing that led him to help found a literary society. In 1793 he gave up the law entirely to pursue a literary career in Philadelphia and New York City.
