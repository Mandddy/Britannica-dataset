Joe Frazier, byname Smokin’ Joe  (born January 12, 1944, Beaufort, South Carolina, U.S.—died November 7, 2011, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) American world heavyweight boxing champion from February 16, 1970, when he knocked out Jimmy Ellis in five rounds in New York City, until January 22, 1973, when he was beaten by George Foreman at Kingston, Jamaica.
During Frazier’s amateur career he was one of the best heavyweights in the United States, but he lost in the Olympic trials to Buster Mathis in 1964 and made it to the Tokyo Olympic Games as a replacement boxer only when Mathis injured his hand. He won the gold medal in his weight division and then began his professional career in August 1965. A chunky man (5 feet 11 inches [1.8 metres] tall and weighing 205 pounds [92.9 kg]) with an aggressive style and a powerful left hook, he was likened to an earlier heavyweight champion, Rocky Marciano.
