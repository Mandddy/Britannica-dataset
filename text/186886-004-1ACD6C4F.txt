Damián Forment,  (born c. 1480, Valencia, kingdom of Aragon [Spain]—died c. 1541, Santo Domingo de la Calzada, Castile) sculptor, recognized as perhaps the most important sculptor in 16th-century Spain. His early work demonstrated a mastery of Renaissance principles, and one of his last pieces is one of the earliest Mannerist works in Spain.
Forment might have been trained in Florence or have come into contact with Florentine artists who influenced his work. In any case, he started his career in his native Valencia, living there until 1509, when he moved to Saragossa. He maintained a studio in Saragossa until his death, executing over the years many large altars, often in alabaster.
