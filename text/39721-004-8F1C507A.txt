Frank Wedekind, original name Benjamin Franklin Wedekind  (born July 24, 1864, Hannover, Hanover [Germany]â€”died  March 9, 1918, Munich) German actor and dramatist who became an intense personal force in the German artistic world on the eve of World War I. A direct forebear of the modern Theatre of the Absurd, Wedekind employed episodic scenes, fragmented dialogue, distortion, and caricature in his dramas, which formed the transition from the realism of his age to the Expressionism of the following generation.
The son of a German American father and a Swiss mother, Wedekind lived in Switzerland from 1872 to 1884, when he moved to Munich, where he remained until his death. He was successively an advertising manager, the secretary of a circus, a journalist for the satirical weekly Simplicissimus, a cabaret performer, and the producer of his own plays. The electric quality of his personality has been attested by his contemporaries.
