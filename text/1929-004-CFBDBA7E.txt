Eartha Kitt, in full Eartha Mae Kitt   (born January 17, 1927, North, South Carolina, U.S.—died December 25, 2008, Weston, Connecticut) American singer and dancer noted for her sultry vocal style and slinky beauty who also achieved success as a dramatic stage and film actress.
Kitt was the daughter of a white father and a black mother, and from the age of eight she grew up with relatives in an ethnically diverse section of Harlem, New York City. At 16 she joined Katherine Dunham’s dance troupe and toured the United States, Mexico, South America, and Europe. When the Dunham company returned to the United States, the multilingual Kitt stayed in Paris, where she won immediate popularity as a nightclub singer. She made her acting debut as Helen of Troy in Time Runs, an Orson Welles adaptation of Faust, in 1950. With her appearance in the Broadway revue New Faces of 1952 and with early 1950s recordings such as “C’est Si Bon,” “Santa Baby,” and “I Want to Be Evil,” Kitt became a star.
