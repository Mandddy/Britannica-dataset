Ancient Iranian religion, diverse beliefs and practices of the culturally and linguistically related group of ancient peoples who inhabited the Iranian plateau and its borderlands, as well as areas of Central Asia from the Black Sea to Khotan (modern Hotan, China).
The northern Iranians (referred to generally as Scythians [Saka] in Classical sources), who occupied the steppes, differed significantly from the southern Iranians. In religion and culture, both the northern and southern Iranians had much in common with the ancient Indo-Aryan-speaking peoples of the Indian subcontinent, although there was much borrowing from Mesopotamia as well, especially in western Iran. From at least the time of the rise of the Median empire, Iranian religion and culture has had a profound influence upon the Middle East, as also the Middle East upon Iran.
