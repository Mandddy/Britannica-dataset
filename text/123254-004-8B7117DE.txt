Nunatak,  isolated mountain peak that once projected through a continental ice sheet or an Alpine-type ice cap. Because they usually occur near the margin of an ice sheet, nunataks were thought to be glacial refuges for vegetation and centres for subsequent reoccupation of the land. Later studies revealed the existence of more likely areas of refuge and the fact that postglacial weathering may destroy glacial evidence on peaks. Thus, identification of a true nunatak is difficult, and such peaks often cannot be used to determine former ice thicknesses.
