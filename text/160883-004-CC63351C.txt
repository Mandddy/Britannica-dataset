Osage River, river rising as the Marais des Cygnes (French: “Swan Marshes”) in the Flint Hills near Eskridge, Kansas, U.S. It becomes the Osage (named for the Osage Indians) after its junction with the Little Osage near Rich Hill, Missouri, and then flows east through the Ozark highlands to enter the Missouri River near Jefferson City. The river is 500 miles (800 km) long and drains 15,300 square miles (39,600 square km). Along the middle of its course the Osage River is dammed by Bagnell Dam, which thereby impounds the Lake of the Ozarks. The dam was built in 1931 to produce electricity for St. Louis.
