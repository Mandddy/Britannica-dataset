Spirit of Saint Louis, airplane in which Charles A. Lindbergh made the first nonstop solo flight from New York to Paris, May 20–21, 1927. His flight was sponsored by a group of businessmen in St. Louis, Mo.
The plane was a Ryan NYP developed from the Ryan M2, a single-engine, high-wing monoplane, modified to Lindbergh’s specifications. In standard conformation the airplane would have seated five people; extra fuel tanks in the “Spirit of St. Louis” occupied much of what had been cabin space. The windshield was replaced by an extension of the nose cowling. Lindbergh had direct vision only from the side windows, relying on a periscope to see straight ahead. There was no radio. The Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine developed a maximum of 237 horsepower. Wing-span of the craft was 46 feet (14 metres) and length 27 feet 8 inches (8.4 metres). Fuel capacity with the extra tanks was 450 gallons; top speed at sea level, when loaded, was 120 miles (200 kilometres) per hour, and range was 4,100 miles (6,600 kilometres).
