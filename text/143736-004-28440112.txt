Bacteriology,  branch of microbiology dealing with the study of bacteria.
The beginnings of bacteriology paralleled the development of the microscope. The first person to see microorganisms was probably the Dutch naturalist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who in 1683 described some animalcules, as they were then called, in water, saliva, and other substances. These had been seen with a simple lens magnifying about 100â€“150 diameters. The organisms seem to correspond with some of the very large forms of bacteria as now recognized.
