Vaishali, Pali Vesali,  city of ancient India, north of Patna, northwestern Bihar state, on the Gandak River. In antiquity Vaishali was the capital of the Licchavi republic and was closely associated with the early histories of both Buddhism and Jainism. Roads connected it with Rajagriha to the south and Kapilavastu and Shravasti to the north. Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, was born in Vaishali and spent much time there. The Buddha also visited the city on many occasions. Its several important monasteries and shrines were described by the Chinese pilgrim Faxian in the 5th century ce. After the death of the Buddha (c. 483 bce), the second great council of Buddhists was held at Vaishali to provide rules of conduct.
According to tradition, the city in early times was surrounded by three walls with gates and watchtowers. The site today is marked by two groups of mounds and has been partly excavated by archaeologists. The earliest occupation of the site is associated with black-and-red pottery of probably pre-Buddhist age; it was followed by the northern black polished ware of early Buddhist times. Vaishali is on the site of a village now known as Besarh.
