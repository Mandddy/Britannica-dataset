The Graduate, American dark comedy film, released in 1967, that made Dustin Hoffman a star and featured a hit sound track by the singing duo Simon and Garfunkel. The film’s groundbreaking portrayal of postgraduate malaise and the alienation of the generation then coming of age made it an unexpected hit.

Torn between taking the path of his father’s generation and a desire to follow his instincts, he ends up courting a beautiful young rich girl (played by Katharine Ross) on the heels of his affair with her mother, the sexy siren Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne Bancroft), who seduces him.
