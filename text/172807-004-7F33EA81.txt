Giovanni Papini,  (born January 9, 1881, Florence, Italy—died July 8, 1956, Florence) journalist, critic, poet, and novelist, one of the most outspoken and controversial Italian literary figures of the early and mid-20th century. He was influential first as a fiercely iconoclastic editor and writer, then as a leader of Italian Futurism, and finally as a spokesman for Roman Catholic religious belief.
Though largely self-educated, Papini soon became a literary leader in Florence. He was a founder of an influential Florentine literary magazine, Leonardo (1903). During this period he wrote several violently antitraditionalist works, such as Il crepuscolo dei filosofi (1906; “The Twilight of the Philosophers”), in which he expressed disenchantment with traditional philosophies. One of his best-known and most frequently translated books is the autobiographical novel Un uomo finito (1912; A Man—Finished; U.S. title, The Failure), a candid account of his early years in Florence and his desires for ideological certainty and personal achievement.
