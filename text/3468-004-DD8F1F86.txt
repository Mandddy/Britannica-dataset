Pheasant, any bird of the family Phasianidae (order Galliformes) that is larger than a quail or partridge. Most pheasants—some 50 species in about 16 genera of the subfamily Phasianinae—are long-tailed birds of open woodlands and fields, where they feed in small flocks. All have hoarse calls and a variety of other notes. The males of most species are strikingly coloured; the females are inconspicuously coloured. A male pheasant—pugnacious in breeding season—has one or more leg spurs and may have fleshy ornaments on the face. Courting males sometimes fight to the death in the presence of hens, who seem utterly indifferent to the commotion.
The centre of distribution of pheasants was originally from China to Malaysia. Several species, however, have been naturalized elsewhere—two thousand years ago or so in Anatolia and Europe—and many are prized as ornamentals in zoos and private collections; they are also raised for sport in shooting preserves. Some species have been brought to the verge of extinction by hunting.
