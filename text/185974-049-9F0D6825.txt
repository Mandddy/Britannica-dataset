Vittoria Colonna,  (born 1492, Marino, near Rome [Italy]—died February 25, 1547, Rome) Italian poet, less important for her poetry than for her personality and her associations with famous contemporaries, particularly Michelangelo.
Of a noble family, Vittoria Colonna married Ferdinando Francesco d’Avalos, marchese di Pescara, in 1509. Her husband seems to have spent most of their married life on military campaigns; nevertheless, when he died in 1525 she began a series of poems in his memory, the best modern edition of which is Rime spirituali (1882; The “In Memoriam” of Italy: A Century of Sonnets from the Poems of Vittoria Colonna). She also wrote much religious poetry.
