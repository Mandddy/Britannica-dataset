Marine Corps War Memorial, in full United States Marine Corps War Memorial,  monument in Arlington county, Va., honouring the members of the United States Marine Corps who have served and died in defense of the United States since the founding of the Corps in 1775. The memorial is located near Arlington National Cemetery. It was designed by Horace W. Peaslee and was dedicated on Nov. 10, 1954.
The monument consists of a large sculpture group on a circular base. The sculpture was inspired by an iconic World War II photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal of six men (five Marines and a U.S. Navy hospital corpsman) raising an American flag atop Mount Suribachi on the Pacific island of Iwo Jima on Feb. 23, 1945, during the battle with the Japanese for the island. Sculptor Felix W. de Weldon was commissioned by the U.S. Congress to cast a much larger than life-size (32-foot [10-metre]) sculpture of the group in bronze to serve as the Marine Corps War Memorial. The three surviving members of the group posed for de Weldon, and the sculptor used photographs as source material for the faces of the three others, who died in the fighting.
