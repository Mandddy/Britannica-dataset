Fanny Jackson Coppin, née Fanny Marion Jackson   (born 1837, Washington, D.C., U.S.—died Jan. 21, 1913, Philadelphia, Pa.) American educator and missionary whose innovations as head principal of the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia included a practice-teaching system and an elaborate industrial-training department.
Born a slave, Fanny Jackson was bought into freedom by an aunt while still a small girl. She determined to get an education and, while employed as a domestic servant, studied to enter the Rhode Island State Normal School. In 1860 she entered Oberlin College. Upon graduating in 1865, Jackson began teaching Latin, Greek, and mathematics at the Institute for Colored Youth, where she also served as principal of the girls’ high school department. In 1869 she became head principal of the Institute; she was the first African-American woman in the country to hold such a position, and she quickly began to direct the course of the school.
