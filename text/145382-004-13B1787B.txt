Gum, in botany, adhesive substance of vegetable origin, mostly obtained as exudate from the bark of trees or shrubs belonging to the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae) of the pea order Fabales. Some plant gums are used in the form of water solutions in the manufacture of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. When the water evaporates, a film having a considerable adhesive character is formed. Some plant gums, such as gum arabic, dissolve in water to give clear solutions. Other gums, such as gum tragacanth, form mucilages by the absorption of large amounts of water.
A gum is produced by making an incision in the bark of the tree and collecting the exudate repeatedly throughout the season. Gums so obtained consist of small lumps, usually transparent and light yellow. Trees produce gums by a process called gummosis, possibly as a protective mechanism, either after mechanical damage to the bark or after a bacterial, insect, or fungal attack upon it. The Acacia senegal tree yields the greatest amount of gum acacia when it is in an unhealthy condition, and good culture methods reduce the yield.
