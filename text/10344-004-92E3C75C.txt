Kuvasz, plural kuvaszok ,  Hungarian breed of guard and shepherd dog whose reputation as a watchdog was unexcelled during the Middle Ages, when it was kept by kings and nobles. The breed originated many centuries ago, perhaps in Central Asia, whence it spread to Hungary, Turkey, India, Tibet, and China. The kuvasz of modern times stands about 26 to 30 inches (66 to 76 cm) and weighs about 70 to 115 pounds (32 to 52 kg). It is a large, sturdily built dog with a slightly wavy, pure-white coat and a handsomely shaped head. The kuvasz makes a loyal and stalwart companion, though it is not overly demonstrative. It is a fast and graceful runner and has a marked air of dignity. As a guard dog it is very protective, and it can act on its own initiative without instruction.
