Anaphylaxis, also called anaphylactic shock,  in immunology, a severe, immediate, potentially fatal systemic allergic reaction to contact with a foreign substance, or antigen, to which an individual has become sensitized.
Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Asthma is another example of a type I reaction, but, whereas asthma is localized to the respiratory region of the body, anaphylaxis has effects throughout the organism. In all type I allergic reactions, sensitization occurs when a substance triggers the immune system to recognize it as a threat to the body. Upon subsequent exposure, an allergic reaction can occur. Almost any substance can induce anaphylaxis, but the most common agents are drugs such as penicillin, foods such as nuts and shellfish, and insect venom. Anaphylaxis may occur after contact with extremely small amounts of antigen and is more common in persons with a history of atopic dermatitis. In some cases anaphylaxis may be precipitated by exercise, and in other cases no cause is known.
