Thorax, the part of an animal’s body between its head and its midsection.
In vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals), the thorax is the chest, with the chest being that part of the body between the neck and the abdomen. The vertebrate thorax contains the chief organs of respiration and circulation—namely, the lungs, some air passages, the heart, and the largest blood vessels (see thoracic cavity). Below, it is bounded by the diaphragm. The bony framework is encased with muscles, fat, and cutaneous tissues (skin). The bony framework of the human thorax consists of the 12 thoracic vertebrae, 12 pairs of ribs, and the sternum (breastbone).
