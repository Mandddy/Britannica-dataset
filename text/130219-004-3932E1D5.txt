Orthopedics, also called orthopedic surgery,  medical specialty concerned with the preservation and restoration of function of the skeletal system and its associated structures, i.e., spinal and other bones, joints, and muscles.
The term orthopedics was introduced in 1741 by French physician Nicolas Andry de Bois-Regard in his work L’Orthopédie, which featured an engraving of a crooked tree splinted with a post and a rope that later became a symbol of the field. The practice of orthopedics was pioneered in the ensuing decades by Jean André Venel, who established an institute in Switzerland for the treatment of crippled children’s skeletal deformities. A vastly increased knowledge of muscular functions and of the growth and development of bone was gained in the 19th century. Significant advances at this time were the new operation of tenotomy (the cutting of tendons, which made correcting deformities easier), the surgical correction of clubfoot, the invention of the Thomas splint (which provided better support for fractures of long bones in the limbs), and the introduction of quick-setting plaster of Paris for use in orthopedic bandages. The efforts of Sir Robert Jones and the massive casualties of World War I led to the founding of many orthopedic training centres in the early 20th century.
