Raj Rajaratnam,  (born June 15, 1957, Colombo, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]) American investor who was convicted in 2011 of securities fraud and conspiracy in one of the largest prosecutions of insider trading (trading on information not available to the public) in U.S. history and the first such case to rely on evidence obtained from wiretaps (see electronic eavesdropping). As manager of the Galleon Group, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund (a limited-membership investment fund that uses speculative strategies to maximize returns), Rajaratnam was at the time of his indictment (in 2009) one of the most prominent and successful investors on Wall Street.
After attending preparatory school in Sri Lanka, Rajaratnam studied engineering at the University of Sussex. He entered the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1981 and received a masterâ€™s degree in business administration two years later. From 1983 to 1985 he worked for Chase Manhattan Bank as a lending officer specializing in technology companies. He became an analyst at the investment bank Needham &amp; Company in 1985 and rose to the presidency of the firm in 1991. The following year he established a hedge fund for Needham clients, which he later purchased with a group of investors when he left Needham in 1997. He renamed the fund the Galleon Group, after the early-modern sailing ships used by the Spanish and the Portuguese to transport precious cargo.
