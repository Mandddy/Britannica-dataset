Green River,  river in the western United States, rising on the Continental Divide in the Wind River Range in west-central Wyoming. It flows generally south through southwestern Wyoming, where it is dammed below La Barge to form the Fontenelle Reservoir. Below Green River city, Wyo., it cuts through Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, where it is impounded to form a large reservoir. It continues through eastern Utah, with a loop into northwestern Colorado, on through the Canyon of Lodore in Dinosaur National Monument and back into Utah. It then flows generally southwest past Green River city, Utah, and southeast to join the Colorado River south of Moab, in Canyonlands National Park. Traversing rugged mountain regions through most of its 730-mile (1,175-kilometre) course, it drains about 45,000 square miles (117,000 square km). It is navigable only by special shallow-draft riverboatsâ€”and then only at high water. Its chief tributaries are the Yampa River, in Colorado, and the Duchesne, Price, White, and San Rafael rivers in Utah. Originally known as the Spanish River, it was renamed in 1824, probably for its colour derived in places from green soapstone banks along its course.
