Cumberland wrestling,  form of wrestling developed in northern England and southern Scotland, also called the North Country style. The wrestlers stand chest to chest, each grasping the other with locked hands around the body, each opponent’s chin on the other’s right shoulder. The right arm is placed below and the left above the adversary’s. When the hold has been firmly taken, an umpire gives the word to start and the bout proceeds until one man touches the ground with any part of his person except his feet or fails to retain his hold. In either case he loses. If both fall together, the one who is underneath or first touches the ground loses. If both fall simultaneously side by side (a dogfall), the bout begins anew. The maneuvers used to throw an adversary are called chips. There is but a single foul—direct kicking. British championships in this style are held annually.
