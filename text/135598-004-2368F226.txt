Abram Stevens Hewitt,  (born July 31, 1822, Haverstraw, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  Jan. 18, 1903, Ringwood, N.J.) American industrialist, philanthropist, and politician who in 1886 defeated Henry George and Theodore Roosevelt to become mayor of New York City.
Hewitt won a scholarship to Columbia College (now part of Columbia University). He graduated in 1842 and remained at Columbia as an instructor of mathematics. He then went into the iron-making business with Edward and Peter Cooper. The firm was a success and Hewitt became wealthy. A man of distinct social conscience, Hewitt produced gun-barrel iron for the federal government during the Civil War without taking a profit.
