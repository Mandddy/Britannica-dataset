Gesù,  mother church in Rome of the Jesuit order, designed by Giacomo da Vignola in 1568. The facade, which was the work of Giacomo della Porta, was added in 1575.
The Gesù—a single-aisle, Latin-cross-plan church with side chapels and a dome over the crossing of the nave and the transepts—became the archetype of many Catholic churches built in the Baroque period and was the source of the so-called Jesuit style of architecture. On the nave ceiling is a fresco—The Triumph of the Name of Jesus, executed in 1678–79 by Giovanni Battista Gaulli, also known as Baciccio—that is one of the masterpieces of Baroque decorative painting.
