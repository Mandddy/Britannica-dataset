Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), U.S. satellite placed in Earth orbit in 1989 to map the “smoothness” of the cosmic background radiation field and, by extension, to confirm the validity of the big bang theory of the origin of the universe.
In 1964 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, working together at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey to calibrate a large microwave antenna prior to using it to monitor radio-frequency emissions from space, discovered the presence of microwave radiation that seemed to permeate the cosmos uniformly. Now known as the cosmic background radiation, this uniform field provided spectacular support for the big bang model, which held that the early universe was very hot and the subsequent expansion of the universe would redshift the thermal radiation of the early universe to much longer wavelengths corresponding to much cooler thermal radiation. Penzias and Wilson shared a Nobel Prize for Physics in 1978 for their discovery, but, in order to test the theory of the early history of the universe, cosmologists needed to know whether the radiation field was isotropic (that is, the same in every direction) or anisotropic (that is, having spatial variation).
