University of Valladolid, Spanish Universidad De Valladolid,  coeducational state institution of higher learning at Valladolid, in northwestern Spain. Established in the 13th century as an outgrowth of an old episcopal school of Valladolid, the university was recognized by Pope Clement VI in 1346 and was endowed and granted special privileges by the kings of Spain. By the 16th century it drew students from all over Spain, training candidates for posts in the Spanish empire. At first a school of liberal arts and theology, the university soon became known for its courses in canon law. It was reorganized as a state university in the 19th century. The modern university includes faculties of law, science, arts and philology, medicine, and economics and business administration. There are a number of colleges for business, engineering, and education and an undergraduate college for the liberal arts.
