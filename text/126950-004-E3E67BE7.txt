Shel Silverstein, in full Sheldon Allan Silverstein   (born September 25, 1930, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died May 10, 1999, Key West, Florida) American cartoonist, children’s author, poet, songwriter, and playwright best known for his light verse and quirky cartoons.
In the 1950s Silverstein drew for the military magazine Stars and Stripes while serving in Japan and Korea, and he also contributed to Playboy. He created the adult book of drawings Now Here’s My Plan: A Book of Futilities (1960) before turning to works for children. His first efforts, written under the name Uncle Shelby, included Uncle Shelby’s ABZ Book: A Primer for Tender Young Minds (1961) and Who Wants a Cheap Rhinoceros (1964). Among his memorable characters were the protagonist in Uncle Shelby’s Story of Lafcadio, the Lion Who Shot Back (1963); the boy-man and tree in The Giving Tree (1964), his most famous prose work; and the partial circle in The Missing Piece (1976). Silverstein’s last illustrated collection, Falling Up, was published in 1996.
