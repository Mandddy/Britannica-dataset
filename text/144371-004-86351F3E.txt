Sligo, Irish Sligeach (“Shelly River”),  county in the province of Connaught, northwestern Ireland. It is bounded by Counties Leitrim (east), Roscommon (southeast), and Mayo (southwest); an arm of the Atlantic Ocean forms its other borders. The town of Sligo is the county seat.
Nearly half of Sligo is rough pasture, predominantly in the mountains, hills, and peat bogs. On the east the boundary with Leitrim runs southward through the coastal lowland to the limestone Dartry Mountains, including Ben Bulben (1,730 feet [527 metres]), which possess spectacular scarped edges. The county boundary then crosses Glencar and an area of plateau to Lough (Lake) Gill, in which is located the island of Innisfree, celebrated in a lyric by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who died in France and was buried there but was reinterred in Drumcliff after World War II. His brother, painter Jack Butler Yeats, spent much of his early life in Sligo. To the south of Lough Gill is a long ridge broken by gaps known as alts. West of the Collooney Gap, the ridge forms the Ox Mountains, a peat moorland measuring 7 to 10 miles (11 to 16 km) wide and rising above 1,700 feet (520 metres). North of the Ox Mountains is an area of continuously farmed lowland, from the mouth of the River Moy to the Leitrim border. Sligo Bay has three long estuaries, leading to the towns of Drumcliff, Sligo, and Ballysadare, which receive the waters of the Rivers Drumcliff, Garravogue, and Owenmore.
