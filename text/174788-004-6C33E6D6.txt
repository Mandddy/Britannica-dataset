Angels with Dirty Faces, American gangster film, released in 1938, that is considered a classic of the genre, influencing countless subsequent movies.
The story centres on boyhood friends Rocky Sullivan (played by James Cagney) and Jerry Connolly (Pat O’Brien), who take radically different paths as adults. Rocky becomes a criminal, while Jerry serves as a neighbourhood priest desperately trying to influence young boys to take the “straight-and-narrow” path in life. When Rocky becomes an idol to some of the boys, it puts him in conflict with his old friend.
