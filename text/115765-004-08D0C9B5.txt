Lachlan River,  chief tributary of the Murrumbidgee River, in New South Wales, Australia. Rising in the Great Dividing Range (Eastern Highlands), 8 miles (13 km) east of Gunning, it flows northwest, and, 30 miles (48 km) upstream from Cowra, it is dammed to form Wyangala Reservoir. Continuing past Forbes and Condobolin, it turns southwest past Lake Cargelligo and Hillston and joins the Murrumbidgee, 130 miles (210 km) from that river’s confluence with the Murray. The main stream, which is about 930 miles (1,500 km) long, and its principal tributaries, including the Abercrombie, Willandra Billabong, Eagle, and Goobang, drain a basin of 32,700 square miles (84,690 square km). Though usually perennial, the river may run dry in severe drought years. Explored in 1815 by George William Evans, it was named after Lachlan Macquarie, governor of New South Wales (1810–21). The Lachlan River valley supports wheat and sheep.
