Custard,  mixture of eggs, milk, sugar, and flavourings which attains its consistency by the coagulation of the egg protein by heat. Baked custard contains whole eggs, which cause the dish to solidify to a gel. Flan, or crème caramel, is a custard baked in a dish coated with caramelized sugar that forms a sauce when the custard is unmolded. For crème brûlée, the baked custard is sprinkled with sugar that is caramelized under a broiler or with a hot iron called a salamander. The sugar forms a thin, crisp shell over the custard.
Boiled custard may omit the white of the egg. It is cooked slowly over hot water until it reaches the consistency of thick cream. Also called crème anglais, boiled custard may be used as a sauce with fruits and pastries or incorporated into desserts such as trifle or rice pudding. The richest ice creams are made with a custard base; the egg whites in this case are sometimes beaten stiffly and the custard folded into them. Bavarian creams are custards stiffened with gelatin.
