Mesite,  any of several species of small, brownish ground-dwelling birds constituting the family Mesitornithidae (sometimes Mesoenatidae), order Gruiformes. They are about 30 cm (12 inches) long, have short wings and a thick tail, and inhabit Madagascar. They differ from all other gruiform birds in possessing powder downs, areas of feathers that continuously disintegrate to a fine powder that is used for preening. Mesites go about in pairs or small flocks, picking up seeds and insects. They walk like pigeons, bobbing the head and tail. Mesitornis (sometimes Mesoenas) unicolor and M. variegata inhabit forests. Bensch’s rail (not a true rail), also called Bensch’s monias (Monias, or Mesoenas, benschi), inhabits brushland. All three species build platform nests low in bushes.
