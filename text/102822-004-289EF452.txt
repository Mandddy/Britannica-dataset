The Pixies, American band whose unique blend of punk rock’s aggression and pop music’s infectious melodies helped establish the sound that would define alternative rock in the 1990s. The members were Charles Michael Kitteridge Thompson IV (also know as Black Francis and Frank Black; b. April 6, 1965, Boston, Mass., U.S.), Joey Santiago (b. June 10, 1965, Manila, Phil.), Kim Deal (b. June 10, 1961, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.), and David Lovering (b. Dec. 6, 1961, Burlington, Mass., U.S.).
The Pixies formed in Boston in 1986, when singer-guitarist Thompson (using the stage name Black Francis) and his former Boston University roommate, guitarist Santiago, decided to put together a band. In response to the duo’s ad in a local newspaper for a “bassist into Hüsker Dü and Peter, Paul, and Mary,” Deal joined the group, bringing along her friend Lovering as a drummer. The Pixies quickly earned a reputation as part of the local Boston club scene and released their full-length debut, Surfer Rosa, in 1988. The album was an instant critical favourite and received considerable airplay on college radio and in Europe. While rougher than the Pixies’ later work, Surfer Rosa established the band’s signature sound: an aggressive blast of searing guitars and Thompson’s screeching vocals, which were oddly but effectively counterbalanced by enchanting pop melodies and Deal’s gentler backup vocals. Equally distinctive were the strange, cryptic lyrics penned by Thompson, which over the years would encompass references ranging from his Pentecostal upbringing to UFOs to Salvador Dalí and Luis Buñuel’s Surrealist film Un Chien andalou (1928; An Andalusian Dog).
