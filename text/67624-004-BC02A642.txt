Plácido Domingo,  (born January 21, 1941, Madrid, Spain) Spanish-born singer, conductor, and opera administrator whose resonant, powerful tenor voice, imposing physical stature, good looks, and dramatic ability made him one of the most popular tenors of his time.
Domingo’s parents were noted performers in zarzuela, a form of Spanish light opera. The family moved to Mexico when he was eight. He studied piano and conducting at the National Conservatory of Music, but he changed the emphasis of his studies when his rich vocal ability was revealed. In 1961 he made his operatic debut in Mexico City and then went to Dallas to perform in its opera company. From 1962 to 1965 he was a resident performer at Tel Aviv’s Hebrew National Opera. He made his debut at the New York City Opera in 1965, at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City in 1968 (subsequently becoming a regular performer there), and at La Scala in Milan in 1969. Over the course of an opera career that lasted more than 45 years, Domingo sang an unprecedented number of different roles—more than 120—and he continued to learn new parts into his 60s.
