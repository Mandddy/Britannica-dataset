Nottinghamshire, administrative, geographic, and historic county of the East Midlands of England, bordered by the geographic counties of Leicestershire, Derbyshire, and Lincolnshire, and by the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire. The administrative, geographic, and historic counties cover slightly different areas. The administrative county has seven districts: Ashfield, Bassetlaw, Mansfield, Newark and Sherwood, and the boroughs of Broxtowe, Gedling, and Rushcliffe. The geographic county encompasses these areas and the city of Nottingham, administratively a separate unitary authority. The historic county of Nottinghamshire is nearly coterminous with the geographic county, but it includes three additional small areas: the area just west of Bawtry and the parish of Finningley, both administratively part of the metropolitan borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, and an area east of Wymeswold in the Charnwood borough of the administrative county of Leicestershire.
The county is oval-shaped, extending 51 miles (82 km) from north to south but only half that distance from east to west, and the major communication routes run north to south. This stems in part from geology, for Nottinghamshire lies on the eastern slope of the Pennines mountain chain, the “spine” of England. Geologic formations outcrop in north-south belts—the oldest in the west and the youngest in the east—while the surface generally falls from west to east.
