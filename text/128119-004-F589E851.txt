Molecular cloud, also called dark nebula,  interstellar clump or cloud that is opaque because of its internal dust grains. The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes because of turbulence. The largest molecular clouds are visible to the naked eye, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way Galaxy. An example is the Coalsack in the southern sky. Stars are born within molecular clouds.
The hydrogen of these opaque dark clouds exists in the form of H2 molecules. The largest nebulae of this type, the so-called giant molecular clouds, are a million times more massive than the Sun. They contain much of the mass of the interstellar medium, are some 150 light-years across, and have an average density of 100 to 300 molecules per cubic centimetre and an internal temperature of only 7 to 15 K. Molecular clouds consist mainly of gas and dust but contain many stars as well. The central regions of these clouds are completely hidden from view by dust and would be undetectable except for the far-infrared thermal emission from dust grains and the microwave emissions from the constituent molecules. This radiation is not absorbed by dust and readily escapes the cloud. The material within the clouds is clumped together on all size scales, with some clouds ranging down to the masses of individual stars. The density within the clumps may reach up to 105 H2 molecules per cubic centimetre or more. Small clumps may extend about one light-year across. Turbulence and the internal magnetic field provide support against the cloudsâ€™ own gravity.
