Towy River, Welsh Tywi,  river, southwest Wales, approximately 65 mi (105 km) long. Rising on the slopes of Esgair Garthen in the district of northwest Brecknockshire (Breconshire) in the county of Powys, it flows southward to Llandovery in a deeply incised valley. Below Llandovery it trends southwest in a broad trough, following a line of weakness in the geological structure, before turning westward to Carmarthen. There the trend becomes sharply southward, possibly because of glacial diversion from an earlier course, and the river enters the Irish Sea in a broad estuary between Llanstephan and Ferryside, where beaches form a basis for tourist and resort activity. The Towy is a noted angling stream, especially for salmon and trout.
