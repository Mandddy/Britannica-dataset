El Escorial, village, western Madrid provincia (province) and comunidad aut√≥noma (autonomous community), central Spain, in the Guadarrama mountains, 26 miles (42 km) northwest of Madrid. It is the site of the Royal Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial, a monastery originally Hieronymite but occupied since 1885 by Augustinians.
Philip II wanted a monastery at El Escorial as a place where all Spanish sovereigns beginning with the emperor Charles V could be buried; all of them have been interred there, with the exception of Philip V, Ferdinand VI, and Alfonso XIII. One of the largest religious establishments in the world (about 675 by 528 feet [206 by 161 metres]), El Escorial was begun in 1563 by Juan Bautista de Toledo, a Renaissance Spanish architect who had worked earlier in Italy, and was completed after his death in 1567 by Juan de Herrera.
