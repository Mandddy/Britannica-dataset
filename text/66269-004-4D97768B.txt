Sir Thomas Overbury,  (baptized June 18, 1581, Compton Scorpion, Warwickshire, England—died September 15, 1613, London) English poet and essayist, victim of an infamous intrigue at the court of James I. His poem A Wife, thought by some to have played a role in precipitating his murder, became widely popular after his death, and the brief portraits added to later editions established his reputation as a character writer.
Overbury was educated at Oxford and entered the Middle Temple, London, in 1598. Having traveled in the Low Countries, in 1606 he became secretary and close adviser to Robert Carr, the king’s favourite who was to become earl of Somerset. Overbury was knighted in 1608, and Carr became Viscount Rochester in 1611.
