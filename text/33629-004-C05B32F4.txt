Jack Dempsey, byname of William Harrison Dempsey, also called the Manassa Mauler  (born June 24, 1895, Manassa, Colo., U.S.—died May 31, 1983, New York, N.Y.) American world heavyweight boxing champion, regarded by many as the apotheosis of the professional fighter. He held the title from July 4, 1919, when he knocked out Jess Willard in three rounds in Toledo, Ohio, until Sept. 23, 1926, when he lost a 10-round decision to Gene Tunney in Philadelphia. Dempsey fought 84 bouts, winning 62, 51 of which were by knockout.
Dempsey started boxing in 1914 under the name Kid Blackie. In 1918 and early 1919 he compiled an impressive number of knockouts, most in the first round, to earn a fight with Willard. The 37-year-old champion proved no match for young Dempsey, who attacked ferociously from the starting bell and knocked Willard to the floor seven times in the first round. Even more primitive in its intensity was Dempsey’s title defense against Argentine heavyweight Luis Angel Firpo in New York City on Sept. 14, 1923. After being knocked out of the ring in the first round, Dempsey battered Firpo into defeat in the second.
