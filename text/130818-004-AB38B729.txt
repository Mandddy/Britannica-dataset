Peter Bogdanovich,  (born July 30, 1939, Kingston, New York, U.S.) American film director, critic, and actor noted for his attempts to revitalize film genres of the 1930s and ’40s.
As a teenager, Bogdanovich studied acting with Stella Adler. He later appeared in small theatrical productions, which he sometimes wrote and directed. In the 1950s he performed onstage with the New York Shakespeare Festival, and in 1959 he directed an Off-Broadway production of Clifford Odets’s The Big Knife. During that time Bogdanovich also contributed criticism and articles to various periodicals, including Esquire and Cahiers du cinéma. His monographs on Orson Welles (1961), Howard Hawks (1962), and Alfred Hitchcock (1963) for the Museum of Modern Art were published to much acclaim, and volumes on Fritz Lang (1967), John Ford (1968), and Allan Dwan (1971) followed.
