Friedrich Wöhler,  (born July 31, 1800, Eschersheim, near Frankfurt am Main [Germany]—died Sept. 23, 1882, Göttingen, Ger.) German chemist who was one of the finest and most prolific of the 19th century.
Wöhler, the son of an agronomist and veterinarian, attended the University of Marburg and then the University of Heidelberg, from which he received a medical degree with a specialty in obstetrics (1823). However, his passion always was chemistry. The eminent professor of chemistry at Heidelberg, Leopold Gmelin, judged Wöhler to be already too advanced to profit from his courses, so he sent him to study with the world-famous Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius. A year of mineral analysis in Stockholm not only provided Wöhler with the best chemical training then available but also cemented a close lifelong bond between the two men. Wöhler quickly mastered the Swedish language and subsequently served as Berzelius’s translator and advocate in Germany.
