Dough,  mixture of flour and liquid with other ingredients, such as leavening agents, shortening, sugar, salt, eggs, and various flavouring materials, used to make baked products. A similar mixture, in more liquefied form, is known as batter.
Doughs are thick and plastic and may be shaped, kneaded, and rolled. They are elastic, allowing much expansion during baking, the degree of elasticity depending upon the amount of elastic protein, or gluten, provided by the flour employed. Doughs are used to make breads and pastries. Sweet doughs, used for such products as coffee cakes and Danish pastries, are richer than bread doughs; they contain larger amounts of shortening, milk, and sugar and various spices, nuts, and fruits.
