Pork, flesh of hogs, usually slaughtered between the ages of six months and one year. The most desirable pork is grayish pink in colour, firm and fine-grained, well-marbled, and covered with an outer layer of firm white fat. About 30 percent of the meat is consumed as cooked fresh meat; the remainder is cured or smoked for bacon and ham, used in sausage, and rendered to produce lard. Because pigs may be infected by the parasitic disease trichinosis, pork must be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C) in order to destroy the disease-causing organism.
Pork carcasses are graded according to the amount of edible meat they will yield. In the United States, where individual cuts are not graded, a U.S. Number 1 carcass is one having the most satisfactory ratio of fat to lean; Number 2, Number 3, and Number 4 have a higher proportion of fat, reducing the amount of lean. Utility-grade pork, which is usually from mature animals, has too little fat and is less firm. The main cuts of pork are hams, spareribs, loin roasts and chops, bellies, picnic shoulders, and shoulder butts.
