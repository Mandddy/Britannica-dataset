Wig, manufactured head covering of real or artificial hair worn in the theatre, as personal adornment, disguise, or symbol of office, or for religious reasons. The wearing of wigs dates from the earliest recorded times; it is known, for example, that the ancient Egyptians shaved their heads and wore wigs to protect themselves from the sun and that the Assyrians, Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans also used artificial hairpieces at times.
It was not until the 16th century, however, that the wig again became a generally acceptable form of adornment or corrective for nature’s defects, as in the case of Queen Elizabeth I. Men’s perukes, or periwigs, for the first time since ancient Egypt, came into widespread use in the 17th century, after Louis XIII began wearing one in 1624. By 1665 the wig industry was established in France by the formation of a wigmakers guild.
