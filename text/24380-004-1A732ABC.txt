Diane Keaton, original name Diane Hall  (born January 5, 1946, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) American motion-picture actress and director who achieved fame in quirky comic roles prior to gaining respect as a dramatic actress.
Keaton studied acting at Santa Ana College in California and at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York. She appeared in summer stock in the mid-1960s and in 1968 understudied the lead in the Broadway rock musical Hair. She had the lead role in Woody Allen’s Broadway play Play It Again, Sam (1969), which she later reprised for the 1972 film version. Keaton made her motion-picture debut in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970); her character, a young naïf divorcing her husband because his hair no longer smells like raisins, established a comic persona that would sustain her early career.
