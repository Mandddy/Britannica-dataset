Daniel Quare,  (born c. 1648, Somersetshire?, England—died March 21, 1724 [1723, Old Style], Croydon, Surrey) celebrated English clock maker who invented a repeating watch mechanism (1680) that sounded the nearest hour and quarter hour when the owner pushed a pin protruding from the case. He also invented a portable barometer (1695), originally fitted with legs but later designed to hang on a wall.
Quare was admitted to the Clockmakers’ Company in 1671 and became a master of the company in 1708. After 1709 he went into partnership with one of his ex-apprentices, Stephen Horseman, who carried on the business after Quare’s death until going bankrupt in 1733.
