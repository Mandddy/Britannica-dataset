Ratana church,  20th-century religious awakening among the New Zealand Maoris and a national political influence, especially during the period 1943â€“63, when its members held all four Maori parliamentary seats in the national capital.
The Ratana church was founded by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana, a Methodist Maori farmer who acquired a reputation as a visionary and faith healer. News of his extraordinary gifts drew Maoris (and some whites) from all parts of New Zealand, who came to hear him preach his doctrine of moral reform under the one God of the Bible. In 1920 he established an interdenominational church at the village of Ratana Pa.
