Kookaburra, also called laughing kookaburra or laughing jackass,  (species Dacelo novaeguineae), eastern Australian bird of the kingfisher family (Alcedinidae), whose call sounds like fiendish laughter. This gray-brown, woodland-dwelling bird reaches a length of 43 cm (17 inches), with an 8- to 10-cm (3.2- to 4-inch) beak. In its native habitat it eats invertebrates and small vertebrates, including venomous snakes. In western Australia and New Zealand, where it has been introduced, the kookaburra has been known to attack chickens and ducklings. Defending their territory year-round, a monogamous pair of these birds lays two clutches of two to four white eggs in its nest in a tree hole. The young often remain with the parents and help raise the next year’s brood.
Also sometimes called the “bushman’s clock,” the kookaburra is heard very early in the morning and just after sunset. The related blue-winged kookaburra (D. leachii), which does not “laugh,” is found across northern Australia.
