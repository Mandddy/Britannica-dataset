Valery Yakovlevich Bryusov,  Bryusov also spelled Briusov and Brjusov  (born Dec. 13 [Dec. 1, Old Style], 1873, Moscow, Russia—died  Oct. 9, 1924, Moscow, Russian S.F.S.R., U.S.S.R.) poet, essayist, and editor, one of the founders and leading members of Russian Symbolism.
Bryusov’s paternal grandfather was a serf who became a merchant, and his maternal grandfather was an amateur poet. Toward the end of 1892, he encountered the theories and poetry of the French Symbolists. He began his studies at Moscow University in 1893 and graduated six years later. In 1894–95 he published a translation of Romances sans paroles (1874; “Songs Without Words”) by the French poet Paul Verlaine, three anthologies of Russian Symbolist poets, and a book of his own poetry bearing the French title Chefs d’oeuvre (“Leading Works”). In the introductions to these books he laid out his ideas on Symbolism. The books caused a literary scandal and brought Bryusov fame.
