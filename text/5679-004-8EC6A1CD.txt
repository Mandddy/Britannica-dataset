Anhydrite,  an important rock-forming mineral, anhydrous calcium sulfate (CaSO4). It differs chemically from gypsum (to which it alters in humid conditions) by having no water of crystallization. Anhydrite occurs most often with salt deposits in association with gypsum, as in the cap rock of the Texas-Louisiana salt domes. Anhydrite is one of the major minerals in evaporite deposits; it also is present in dolomites and limestones, and as a gangue mineral in ore veins. It is used in plasters and cement as a drying agent. Anhydrite crystals possess orthorhombic symmetry. For physical properties, see sulfate mineral (table).
