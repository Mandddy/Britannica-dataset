Hymen, also called Hymenaeus,  in Greek mythology, the god of marriage, whose name derives from the refrain of an ancient marriage song. Unknown to Homer, he was mentioned first by the 5th-century-bc lyric poet Pindar as the son of Apollo by one of the Muses. Various Muses are mentioned as his mother: Calliope (ancient commentary on Pindar), Clio (Apollodorus), Terpsichore (Alciphron), and Urania (Catullus and Nonnus). Other accounts made him the son of Dionysus and Aphrodite, and as such he would have been a god of fruitfulness. In Attic legend he was a beautiful youth who rescued a group of women, including the girl he loved, from a band of pirates. As a reward he obtained the girl in marriage, and their happy life caused him ever afterward to be invoked in marriage songs.
