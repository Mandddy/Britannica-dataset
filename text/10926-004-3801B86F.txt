Rogers Hornsby, byname the Rajah  (born April 27, 1896, Winters, Texas, U.S.—died January 5, 1963, Chicago, Illinois) American professional baseball player, generally considered the game’s greatest right-handed hitter. His major league career batting average of .358 is second only to Ty Cobb’s .366.
Hornsby made his major league debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1915 at age 19. After playing a number of positions early in his career, in 1920 he moved to second base, which became his primary position for the remainder of his career. Hornsby led the National League (NL) in batting for six consecutive seasons, 1920–25, hitting over .400 in three of those seasons (1922, 1924–25). His 1924 average of .424 was the second highest attained in the major leagues in the 20th century (trailing only Nap Lajoie’s .426 average in 1901). In addition to his outstanding ability to hit for average, Hornsby had great power: during his six-year reign as the NL’s batting champion, he also led the league in slugging percentage each season and in home runs twice (1922, 1925). He captured the League Award (a precursor to the Most Valuable Player award) in 1925. In 1926, as the Cardinals’ playing manager, he led the team to its first World Series victory, a seven-game triumph over the New York Yankees.
