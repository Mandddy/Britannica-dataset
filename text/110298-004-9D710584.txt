Tim Duncan, in full Timothy Theodore Duncan  (born April 25, 1976, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands) American collegiate and professional basketball player, who led the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to five championships (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014).
In his youth, Duncan excelled in freestyle swimming and had hopes of participating in the Olympics after seeing his older sister, Tricia, compete as a member of the Virgin Islands swim team in 1988. The following year, however, Hurricane Hugo destroyed most of the islandâ€™s swimming pools, and Duncan was left unable to train. He began playing basketball and proved a natural at the sport, but he attracted little interest from college scouts. In 1993 Duncan entered Wake Forest University, where he gained national attention with his all-around play and poise. He was predicted to be the number one pick in the NBA draft following his junior year, but Duncan elected to stay in school. In his final season he received the John R. Wooden Award as the outstanding collegiate player in the United States.
