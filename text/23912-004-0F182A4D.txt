Eddie Cochran, original name Ray Edward Cockran   (born Oct. 3, 1938, Albert Lea, Minn., U.S.—died April 17, 1960, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, Eng.) a first-generation rock-and-roll singer, guitarist, and songwriter who died at age 21 in a car crash while on tour in England.
Cochran’s family lived in Oklahoma and Minnesota before settling in California in 1950, and the young Cochran sang and played country music—touring and recording as part of the Cochran Brothers, with the unrelated Hank Cochran—until the arrival of Elvis Presley persuaded him to change his style. His good looks made him a perfect swivel-hipped rock-and-roll idol, which is evident in his appearances in a series of exploitation movies: The Girl Can’t Help It (1956), Untamed Youth (1957), and Go Johnny Go (1959).
