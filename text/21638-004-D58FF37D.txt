Jessie Redmon Fauset, married name Jessie Redmon Harris  (born April 27, 1882, Snow Hill, N.J., U.S.—died April 30, 1961, Philadelphia, Pa.) African American novelist, critic, poet, and editor known for her discovery and encouragement of several writers of the Harlem Renaissance.
Fauset graduated from Cornell University (B.A., 1905), and she later earned a master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania (1919). For several years she taught French in an all-black secondary school in Washington, D.C. While there she published articles in The Crisis magazine, the journal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Its editor, W.E.B. Du Bois, persuaded her to move to New York City to become the magazine’s literary editor. In that capacity, from 1919 to 1926, she published the works of such writers as Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, and Jean Toomer. She also edited and wrote for The Brownies’ Book, a short-lived periodical for black children. In 1929 she married Herbert Harris. Following his death in 1958, Fauset lived with her half brother.
