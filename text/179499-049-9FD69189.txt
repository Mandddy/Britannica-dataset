Container ship, oceangoing vessel designed to transport large, standard-sized containers of freight. Rail-and-road containers were used early in the 20th century; in the 1960s containerization became a major element in ocean shipping as well. Container ships, which are large and fast, carry containers above deck as well as below, and their cargoes can be loaded and unloaded rapidly.
