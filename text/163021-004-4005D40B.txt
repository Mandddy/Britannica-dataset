Leonard M. Adleman,  (born Dec. 31, 1945, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.) American computer scientist and cowinner, with American computer scientist Ronald L. Rivest and Israeli cryptographer Adi Shamir, of the 2002 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for their “ingenious contribution for making public-key cryptography useful in practice.” The three scientists patented their “Cryptographic Communication System and Method,” commonly known as RSA encryption, and assigned the patent rights to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
Adleman received a bachelor’s degree (1968) in mathematics and a doctorate (1976) in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, where his thesis adviser was Manuel Blum (the 1995 Turing Award winner). After leaving Berkeley, Adleman taught in the mathematics department at MIT (1976–80) and then in the computer science department at the University of Southern California (1980– ), where he is the Henry Salvatori Professor (1985– ) and a Distinguished Professor (2000– ).
