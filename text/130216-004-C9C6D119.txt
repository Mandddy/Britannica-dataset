Ganglion cyst, saclike structure containing thick gelatinous fluid that appears on the top or underside of the wrist or, less commonly, on the top of the foot. The cause is unknown, but trauma (wound or injury) to the tendon sheaths or the lining material of the joint may be implicated; it is most common in persons who use their hands and wrists constantly (e.g., typists and pianists). The swelling develops slowly, usually causes little or no pain, and may disappear spontaneously. The fluid may be removed by aspiration with a needle and syringe. Surgical removal of the ganglion may be necessary in some cases.
