Leaf cactus (genus Epiphyllum), also called orchid cactus,  any of about 15 species of plants in the family Cactaceae native to tropical and subtropical America, including the West Indies. The plants are mostly epiphytic (grow on other plants) but sometimes grow from the ground.
Common names are leaf cactus, for the mostly flattened nonspiny stems that function as leaves, or orchid cactus, for the spectacular large flowers of many colours. These names also refer to hybrids often grown in cultivation. Flowers are red, white, or yellow, on tubes up to 38 cm (about 15 inches) long, usually nocturnal, and often fragrant; they are among the largest in the cactus family. Many species have edible fruit.
