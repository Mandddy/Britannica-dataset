Shopping centre, also called shopping mall, or shopping plaza,  20th-century adaptation of the historical marketplace, with accommodation made for automobiles. A shopping centre is a collection of independent retail stores, services, and a parking area conceived, constructed, and maintained by a management firm as a unit. Shopping centres may also contain restaurants, banks, theatres, professional offices, service stations, and other establishments.
Aspects considered by planners when a shopping centre is to be built include feasibility of the site in terms of the communityâ€™s ability to support a centre; adequate vehicular access; and size, access, and topography of the site, as well as availability of utilities, zoning laws, and land use in the immediate area. Economic conditions of the area, the sociology of the region, and local commercial competition and attitudes determine the size of centre that can be supported and the kind of stores acceptable to a given locale.
