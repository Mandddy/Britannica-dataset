Dizzy Gillespie, byname of John Birks Gillespie  (born Oct. 21, 1917, Cheraw, S.C., U.S.—died  Jan. 6, 1993, Englewood, N.J.) American jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader who was one of the seminal figures of the bebop movement.
Gillespie’s father was a bricklayer and amateur bandleader who introduced his son to the basics of several instruments. After his father died in 1927, Gillespie taught himself the trumpet and trombone; for two years he attended the Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina, where he played in the band and took music classes. His first professional job was in Frankie Fairfax’s band in Philadelphia; his early style showed the strong influences of his idol, trumpeter Roy Eldridge. Gillespie’s penchant for clowning and capriciousness earned him the nickname Dizzy. In 1937 he was hired for Eldridge’s former position in the Teddy Hill Orchestra and made his recording debut on Hill’s version of “King Porter Stomp.”
