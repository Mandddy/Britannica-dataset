Hampton Court, also called Hampton Court Palace,  Tudor palace in the Greater London borough of Richmond upon Thames. It overlooks the north bank of the River Thames. In the 1520s the palace was given by Thomas Cardinal Wolsey to Henry VIII (reigned 1509–47), who enlarged it as his favourite residence. Trees and shrubs were planted throughout its spacious grounds, and various buildings and fountains also were added. The gardens were redesigned in Dutch style for William III (reigned 1689–1702); the architect Christopher Wren added a wing for William and his wife, Queen Mary II. The palace became known for the sumptuous pageants and banquets held there for Elizabeth I and subsequent rulers. George II (ruled 1727–60) was the last reigning monarch to occupy Hampton Court, and in 1851 Queen Victoria conferred the palace on the British government. The state rooms are open to the public, and the palace and its gardens, with Bushy Park adjoining, are one of London’s major tourist attractions.
The famous Maze in the Hampton Court gardens was originally planted in the late 17th century; the present Great Vine was planted by Lancelot (“Capability”) Brown in 1768 or 1769. The Wren wing was severely damaged by fire in 1986. In the restoration of the wing, which was complete in the mid-1990s, the original furnishings were returned to the rooms for the first time since the 18th century. Further restoration projects are ongoing. See also labyrinth.
