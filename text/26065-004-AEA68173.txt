FitzRoy James Henry Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan,  (born September 30, 1788, Badminton, Gloucestershire, England—died June 28, 1855, near Sevastopol, Crimea, Russia) field marshal, first British commander in chief during the Crimean War. His leadership in the war has usually been criticized.
During the Napoleonic Wars and afterward, Somerset served as the Duke of Wellington’s military secretary. In 1852 he became master general of the ordnance and was created Baron Raglan. After Great Britain declared war on Russia (March 27, 1854), he led a force that was sent first to Turkey and then to Crimea, where it landed (September 14) along with French and Turkish armies. The Allies won the Battle of the Alma (September 20), but, forfeiting their advantage, they delayed their attack on Sevastopol until October and thus allowed the Russians to build up their defenses.
