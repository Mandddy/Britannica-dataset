Alla Pugacheva, in full Alla Borisovna Pugacheva  (born April 15, 1949, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian popular singer known for her unique combination of Slavic musical sensibility and Western musical aesthetics.
Pugacheva was a student at a music school in Moscow when she launched her popular-music career in 1965 with “Robot,” a rock song that proved a modest success. Disappointed with similarly styled songs that were written for her, Pugacheva traveled through the Soviet Union in search of a singing style that would both move audiences and make use of her vocal finesse and engaging stage presence. While performing in obscurity over the next decade, she developed a versatile pop style that was coloured by Western influences but quintessentially Slavic in its dramatic and emotional appeal.
