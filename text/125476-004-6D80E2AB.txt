Balloon flight, passage through the air of a balloon that contains a buoyant gas, such as helium or heated air, for which reason it is also known as lighter-than-air free flight. Unmanned balloons have been used to carry meteorological instruments and may be radio-controlled. Manned balloons have a basket, or gondola, attached below the balloon for the pilot and passengers. A simple harness or boatswainâ€™s chair has become popular for solo flights. By adjusting the ascent and descent of a balloon through the air, a pilot can take advantage of available winds to guide the course of the balloon over the surface of Earth. This element of control, or the lack of it, is the hallmark of sport ballooning.
The first untethered manned balloon ascent took place on November 21, 1783, when two Frenchmen climbed into a wicker basket suspended from the base of a beautifully decorated, paper-lined cotton balloon. The balloon, filled with air heated by burning straw, carried the men aloft for a little more than 20 minutes over Paris. Witnessing this ascension were Louis XVI, members of the French Academy of Sciences, and multitudes of the public, including the American inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin. This event left a profound impression on the world of the 18th century: men had actually flown! Since that time the field of flight has been taken over by airships, gliders, airplanes, helicopters, and even rockets and spacecraft, but balloons continue to be used for recreation, competitive sport, and scientific exploration.
