Fescue (genus Festuca), large genus of grasses in the family Poaceae, native to temperate and cold regions of both hemispheres. Several species are important pasture and fodder grasses, and a few are used in lawn mixtures. Some, such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), grow well on bare ground and can outcompete other plants, making them useful for erosion control.
Fescue grasses are annuals or perennials and are typically tufted or clumping; some species spread with stolons or rhizomes. The genus is roughly divided into “fine-leaved” plants with thin needlelike leaves or “broad-leaved” plants with straplike leaves. The wind-pollinated flowers are usually bisexual and are borne on tall terminal panicles (loose branching clusters); they produce feathery seed heads.
