Türbe, (
        Turkish: “tomb-tower”, ) Persian Gonbad,  form of mausoleum architecture developed by and popular among the Seljuq Turks in Iran (mid-11th to 13th century) and later carried by them into Iraq and Anatolia.
The tower form of the tomb may have been based on the cylindrical and conical forms of Seljuq tents. The earliest towers, varying in height up to 200 feet (60 m), were traditionally built on a circular ground plan, but square and polygonal configurations had become popular by the 12th century.
