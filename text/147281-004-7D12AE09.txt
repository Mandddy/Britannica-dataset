Fossil record, history of life as documented by fossils, the remains or imprints of the organisms from earlier geological periods preserved in sedimentary rock. In a few cases the original substance of the hard parts of the organism is preserved, but more often the original components have been replaced by minerals deposited from water seeping through the rock. Occasionally the original material is simply removed, while nothing is deposited in its place; in this case, all that remains is a mould of the shape of the plant or animal. A brief treatment of the fossil record follows. For full treatment, see geochronology.
In some places, such as the Grand Canyon in Arizona, it is possible to recognize a great thickness of nearly horizontal strata representing the deposition of sediment on the seafloor over many hundreds of millions of years. It is often observed that each layer in such a sequence contains fossils that are distinct from those of the layers that are above and below it. In such sequences of layers in different places, the same, or similar, fossil floras or faunas occur in the identical order. By comparison of overlapping sequences it is possible to build up a continuous record of faunas or floras that have progressively more in common with present-day life forms as the top of the sequence is approached.
