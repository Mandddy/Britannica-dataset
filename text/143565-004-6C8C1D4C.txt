Degu (genus Octodon), one of four species of ratlike South American rodents found primarily on the lower western slopes of the Andes Mountains. It is one of the most common mammals of central Chile at elevations up to 1,200 metres (3,900 feet), where it prefers open grassy areas near shrubs, rocks, and stone walls.
Degus have a large head, large eyes, and moderate-sized, nearly hairless ears. They weigh 170 to 300 grams (6 to 10.6 ounces) and have a body 25 to 31 cm (9.8 to 12.2 inches) long and a shorter, black-tipped tail of 8 to 13 cm. Long, comblike bristles project over claws on the hind feet. The soft, thick fur of the upperparts is yellowish brown, and there is a pale yellow spot above and below each eye. The underparts are creamy yellow; some individuals exhibit a pale neck band.
