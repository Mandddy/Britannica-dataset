Tahar Ben Jelloun,  (born December 1, 1944, Fès, Morocco) Moroccan-French novelist, poet, and essayist who wrote expressively about Moroccan culture, the immigrant experience, human rights, and sexual identity.
While studying philosophy at Muḥammad V University in Rabat, Ben Jelloun began to write poems for the politically charged journal Soufflés. After publishing his first collection of poetry, Hommes sous linceul de silence (1971; “Men Under the Shroud of Silence”), he moved to France. There he continued to write poems, collected in Cicatrices du soleil (1972; “Scars of the Sun”), Le Discours du chameau (1974; “The Discourse of the Camel”), and Grains de peau (1974; “Particles of Skin”), but he started to focus on other forms of writing as well. His first novel was Harrouda (1973), an erotic poetic evocation of infancy, youth, and coming to manhood in Fès and Tangier.
