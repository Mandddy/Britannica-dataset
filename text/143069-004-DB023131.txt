Lovage (Levisticum officinale), herb of the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae) native to southern Europe. It is cultivated for its stalks and foliage, which are used for tea, as a vegetable, and to flavour foods, particularly meats. Its rhizomes (underground stems) are used as a carminative and its seeds as flavouring in confectionery and liqueurs. Lovage has a sweet flavour similar to that of celery. Its essential oil is obtained from the flowering tops for use in perfumery and flavouring.
