Lev Kamenev, original name Lev Borisovich Rosenfeld, in full Lev Borisovich Kamenev  (born July 18, 1883, Moscow, Russia—died August 24, 1936, Moscow) Old Bolshevik and prominent member of the Communist Party and Soviet government during the decade after the October Revolution in Russia (1917). He became an opponent of Joseph Stalin and was executed during the Great Purge.
Born to middle-class parents who themselves had been involved in the Russian revolutionary movement of the 1870s, Kamenev became a professional revolutionary, joining the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party (1901) and its Bolshevik faction (1903). In 1908 he emigrated to western Europe, where he worked closely with the Bolshevik leader Vladimir I. Lenin and met his future wife, Olga Bronshtein, the sister of Leon Trotsky. In 1914 Lenin sent him back to Russia, but, when Kamenev directed the Bolshevik delegates to the Duma (Russian parliament) to oppose Russia’s participation in World War I, he was arrested and exiled to Siberia (November 1914).
