Barbara Mikulski, in full Barbara Ann Mikulski  (born July 20, 1936, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.) American politician who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1986 and began representing Maryland in that body the following year. She was the first Democratic woman senator not elected as a replacement for her spouse, and in 2011 she surpassed Margaret Chase Smith’s record to become the longest-serving female senator. Mikulski previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1977–87).
Mikulski was raised in the Highlandtown neighbourhood of Baltimore, where her parents ran a grocery store. Inspired by the life of Marie Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, she aspired to a career in the sciences but found herself better suited to social work. She received a bachelor’s degree in sociology from Mount Saint Agnes College (now part of Loyola University) in 1958. While working for social service organizations in Baltimore, Mikulski attended the University of Maryland, receiving a master’s degree in social work in 1965. She then worked for agencies that addressed drug addiction and the treatment of the elderly.
