Museum of the History of Science, University of Oxford collection of early scientific instruments and apparatus. Although not given its present name until 1935, the museum began in 1924. In that year, the collection of early instruments in the possession of Lewis Evans (whose brother Sir Arthur Evans had been curator of the Ashmolean Museum) was housed in the Old Ashmolean Building. Other exhibits were added to that collection by its first curator, Robert Gunther, and by the early 1930s the museum occupied all three floors of the building, where it still remains. The building itself was erected in 1683 to house the Ashmolean Museum, which moved to new premises in the late 19th century. The present range of exhibits includes some of the largest collections of sundials, astrolabes, and microscopes in the world.
