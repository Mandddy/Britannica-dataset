Omnivore, animal with wide food preferences, which can eat both plant and animal matter. Many small birds and mammals are omnivorous; deer mice and mockingbirds have diets that at different times may include a preponderance of insects or berries. Many animals generally considered carnivores are actually omnivorous, among them the red fox, which enjoys fruits and berries, and the snapping turtle, one-third of whose diet is provided by plants.
