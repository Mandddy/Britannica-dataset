Coma Berenices, (
        Latin: “Berenice’s Hair”) constellation in the northern sky at about 13 hours right ascension and 20° north in declination. Its brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, with a magnitude of 4.3. This constellation contains the Coma cluster of galaxies, the nearest rich galaxy cluster at a distance of 33 million light-years. A notable feature of this constellation is a cluster of nearly 40 stars, the brightest of which are 5th-magnitude stars. Coma Berenices is named for Queen Berenice II of Egypt, who in 246 bce sacrificed her hair to the goddess Aphrodite to ensure the safe return of her husband, King Ptolemy III Euergetes, from battle. Her hair disappeared from Aphrodite’s temple, but court astronomer Conon of Samos claimed he could see where it had been placed among the stars in the region of the constellations Boötes, Leo, and Virgo.
