Jessica Lange,  (born April 20, 1949, Cloquet, Minnesota, U.S.) American actress known for her versatility and intelligent performances.
Lange attended the University of Minnesota on an art scholarship but dropped out to travel. She lived in Paris, where she studied mime, before settling in New York City. A sometime model, she caught the eye of producer Dino De Laurentiis, who cast her in his big-budget remake of King Kong (1976). Langeâ€™s film debut was ridiculed by critics, and she did not work again for more than two years. After several small roles, she attracted attention with another remake, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). Although the sexually charged drama received mixed reviews, Lange earned praise as the adulterous wife who plots to kill her husband. Her double breakthrough came in 1982. In Frances she starred as the gifted but doomed actress Frances Farmer. The emotionally draining role almost led to a breakdown, but Lange found comic relief in the gender-bending farce Tootsie, playing a vulnerable soap opera actress. She earned Academy Award nominations for both films and was named best supporting actress for Tootsie.
