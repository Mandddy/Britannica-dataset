Chares of Lindos,  (flourished 3rd century bce, Lindos, Rhodes, Greece) ancient Greek sculptor who created the Colossus of Rhodes, usually counted among the Seven Wonders of the World. A pupil of the sculptor Lysippus, Chares fashioned for the Rhodians a colossal bronze statue of the sun god Helios, the cost of which was defrayed by selling engines of war left by Demetrius I Poliorcetes after a siege in 305â€“304 bce. The Colossus was said to be 70 cubits (105 feet; 32 m) in height. The notion that it bestrode the harbour has been discredited. It was destroyed by an earthquake about 225 bce.
