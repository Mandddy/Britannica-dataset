Bill Murray, in full William James Murray  (born September 21, 1950, Wilmette, Illinois, U.S.) American comedian and actor best known for his trademark deadpan humour on television’s Saturday Night Live and for his film roles.
Murray, one of eight children, began his acting career on the National Lampoon Radio Hour (1975) alongside fellow comedians John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. From 1977 to 1980 Murray performed on NBC’s Saturday Night Live comedy sketch show, on which he popularized a seedy, shifty comedic persona. He launched his film career with a string of commercial hits, including Meatballs (1979), Caddyshack (1980), and Stripes (1981). In 1984 Murray starred with Aykroyd and Harold Ramis in Ghostbusters, which became one of the highest-grossing films of the decade.
