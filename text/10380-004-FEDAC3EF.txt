Kpelle, also called Guerze ,  people occupying much of central Liberia and extending into Guinea, where they are sometimes called the Guerze; they speak a language of the Mande branch of the Niger-Congo family.
The Kpelle are primarily farmers. Rice is their staple crop and is supplemented by cassava, vegetables, and fruits; cash crops include rice, peanuts (groundnuts), sugarcane, and kola nuts. The Kpelle practice slash-and-burn agriculture. The typical household consists of a man, his several wives, and their children; they live either in rectangular wattle-and-daub huts with thatched roofs or in the more traditional round huts with conical thatched roofs. The household is the usual farming unit, but some farm work is also performed by a voluntary cooperative work group.
