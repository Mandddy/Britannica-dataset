Avignon, city, capital of Vaucluse département, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur région, southeastern France. It lies at a point on the east bank of the Rhône River where the narrow valley opens into a broad delta plain, northwest of Nîmes. It was the capital of the papacy from 1309 to 1377. Recognized for its architectural beauty and historic importance, the centre of Avignon was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1995, and the city served as the European cultural capital for 2000.
Excavations indicate that the earliest settlement in Avignon dates to about 5,000 years ago. A stronghold of the Gallic tribe of Cavares that became the Roman city of Avennio, it was a much-fought-over prize. In the 12th century Avignon became independent, with a flourishing trade, but in the 13th century it was occupied by King Louis VIII and subsequently lost its independence.
