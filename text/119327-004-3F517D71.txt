Paca (genus Cuniculus), either of two species of South American rodents with piglike bodies, large heads, and swollen cheeks. They have short ears, large eyes, and long whiskers, and their bodies are stout, with large rumps and short limbs. The front feet have four toes, and the hindfeet have five—two tiny side toes and three long weight-bearing middle toes, all with thick claws.
The paca (Cuniculus paca) is found from eastern Mexico to northern Argentina and northern Uruguay, living in tropical forests at elevations ranging from sea level to 3,000 metres (9,800 feet). It weighs 5 to 13 kg (11 to 29 pounds) and has a body length of 60 to 78 cm (24 to 31 inches). Its stumpy tail (1 to 3 cm [0.4 to 1.2 inches] long) is hidden beneath the rump hairs. Straight and bristlelike hairs lie flat in its coarse shiny coat. The paca’s upperparts are dark brown or chestnut, with three or four lines of large white spots extending from head to rump on each side of the body; spots coalesce on some individuals. Underparts are white.
