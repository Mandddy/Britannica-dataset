John Hughlings Jackson,  (born April 4, 1835, Green Hammerton, Yorkshire [now in North Yorkshire], Eng.—died  Oct. 7, 1911, London) British neurologist whose studies of epilepsy, speech defects, and nervous-system disorders arising from injury to the brain and spinal cord helped to define modern neurology.
Jackson was physician to the National Hospital for the Paralyzed and Epileptic, London (1862–1906), and the London Hospital (1859–94). In 1864 he confirmed the discovery by Paul Broca, a French surgeon, that the speech centre of right-handed persons is located in the left cerebral hemisphere, and vice versa, by finding that, in most cases, he was able to associate aphasia (a speech disorder) in right-handed persons with disease of the left cerebral hemisphere.
