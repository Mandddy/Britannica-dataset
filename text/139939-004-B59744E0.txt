U.S. Open, byname of the United States Open Championship,  one of the world’s major golf tournaments, open to both amateur and professional golfers (hence the name). It has been held annually since 1895 under supervision of the United States Golf Association (USGA).
Since 1898 the competition has been 72 holes of stroke play (the player with the lowest total number of strokes is the winner). Regional qualifying tournaments have been held since 1924 to keep the number of players manageable, although golfers also become eligible to compete in the U.S. Open by winning specified tournaments. The U.S. Open is the second of the four major championships (after the Masters in April) on the Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA) Tour each year, and it is a key event of the European and Asian professional tours as well. The event is scheduled for June, with the U.S. Open’s fourth and final round usually played on Father’s Day (the third Sunday in June). In case of a tie after 72 holes and the need for a play-off, an additional 18-hole round is played the next day. The U.S. Open is the only one of the four majors that demands a full round of golf to determine its winner after a tie, followed by a sudden-death play-off if the players are still even after the fifth round. The U.S. Open is as stern a test of golf as there is in the game, and several champions have won with over-par scores. Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, New Jersey, Pebble Beach Golf Links in California, and Oakmont Country Club and Merion Golf Club, near Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, respectively, are among the famous sites that have hosted several U.S. Opens.
