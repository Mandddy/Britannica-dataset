Balsas River, Spanish Río Balsas,  river in south-central Mexico, one of that country’s largest rivers. It rises as the Atoyac River at the confluence of the San Martín and Zahuapan rivers in Puebla state and flows southwestward and then westward through the Balsas Depression into Guerrero state, in which it is the principal river and is locally known as the Mezcala. It forms the border between Guerrero and Michoacán states and empties into the Pacific Ocean at Mongrove Point. Although its 479-mile (771-km) course is unnavigable because it is frequently interrupted by rapids, the river is utilized extensively for generating hydroelectric power and for irrigation. Corn (maize), coffee, cotton, sugarcane, tropical fruits, and vegetables are the principal crops cultivated in its basin.
