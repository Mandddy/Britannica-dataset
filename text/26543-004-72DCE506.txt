Francisco Salzillo, in full Francisco Salzillo y Alcaraz, Salzillo also spelled Zarcillo, Salsillo, or Salcillo  (born May 1707, Murcia, Spainâ€”died  March 2, 1783, Murcia) sculptor, a prolific creator of figures for the Holy Week procession. He is considered by some authorities to be the greatest sculptor in 18th-century Spain and by others as merely an excellent folk artist.
Growing up in provincial Murcia, he received his training from his father, a Neapolitan sculptor whose studio produced religious statues. Salzillo entered a Dominican monastery as a youth, but on the death of his father in 1727 he left to take charge of the family studio. Remaining in Murcia all his life, he produced numerous polychrome religious figures with the assistance of his brothers and sister.
