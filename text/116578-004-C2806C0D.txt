Banffshire, also called Banff,  historic county, northeastern Scotland, extending from the Grampian Mountains to the North Sea. The northeastern portion of the county, including the historic county town (seat) of Banff, is part of the council area of Aberdeenshire, while the remainder of the county lies within the council area of Moray.
Of the northern Picts who possessed the land of Banffshire in Roman times, few remains now exist beyond the cairns found in Glenlivet, near Rothiemay and Ballindalloch castles, and elsewhere. The word cairn also occurs in many place-names. The Romansâ€™ advance was practically prevented by the mountains in the south, but what is believed to have been a Roman camp may still be made out in Glenbarry. Danish invaders were more persevering and more successful, and there were many bloody conflicts between them and the Scots. Near Cullen a fierce encounter occurred in 960, and a sculptured stone at Mortlach is said to commemorate a signal victory gained by King Malcolm II over the Norsemen in 1010.
