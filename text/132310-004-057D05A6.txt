Canadian Space Agency (CSA), French Agence spatiale canadienne,  Canadian government organization founded in 1989 that coordinates spaceflight activities. Its headquarters are in Longueuil, Que. The chief executive of the CSA is the president, who is assisted by a senior vice president and the directors of four branches: Space Science, Space Technologies, Space Programs, and General Operations. The president reports to the minister of industry.
The CSA is responsible for the Earth-observation satellite Radarsat-1, which uses radar to monitor Earth’s resources, and the MOST orbiting telescope, which studies physical processes in stars. International cooperation with other space agencies is an important part of the CSA’s mission. Canadarm, the robotic arm on the U.S. space shuttles, was built in Canada. To the International Space Station the CSA has contributed two robotic systems: Canadarm 2, a manipulator arm, and Dextre, a two-armed robot that can be used to repair equipment outside the space station. European science satellites, such as Herschel and Planck, also benefited from carrying instruments developed in Canada.
