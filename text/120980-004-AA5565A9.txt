Narcissus (genus Narcissus), genus of about 40 species of bulbous, often fragrant, plants in the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). The genus is native primarily to Europe and includes a number of garden ornamentals such as daffodil (or trumpet narcissus, Narcissus pseudonarcissus), jonquil (N. jonquilla), and poet’s narcissus (N. poeticus). The bulbs of Narcissus species, which are poisonous, were once used in medicines as an emetic and cathartic. An oil from jonquil flowers is used in perfumes.
Most species are perennials and emerge from bulbs in the spring. The flattened leaves arise from the base of the plant and range in height from 5 cm (2 inches) to 1.2 metres (4 feet), depending on the species. The central crown of each yellow, white, or pink flower ranges in shape from the form of a trumpet, as in the daffodil, to a ringlike cup, as in the poet’s narcissus. Some species hybridize in the wild, and many horticultural crosses between species have resulted in attractive garden hybrids.
