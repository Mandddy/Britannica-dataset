Dame Wendy Hiller,  (born August 15, 1912, Bramhall, Cheshire, Englandâ€”died May 14, 2003, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire) English stage and film actress known for her direct and unsentimental portrayals of intelligent and spirited women.
Hiller was educated at Winceby House School and at age 18 joined the Manchester Repertory Company, for which she acted and stage-managed for several years. She scored her first major success as Sally Hardcastle in Love on the Dole (London 1935, New York 1936), a play whose coauthor, Ronald Gow, she subsequently married. Her performance so impressed George Bernard Shaw that he asked her to play Joan of Arc in his Saint Joan at the 1936 Malvern Festival. Shaw later declared her independent and down-to-earth interpretation of Saint Joan as the definitive portrayal, and he was instrumental in securing for her the role of Eliza Doolittle in the film version of Pygmalion (1938), in which she turned in a brilliantly comic Academy Award-nominated performance. She was equally memorable as another Shaw heroine in the screen adaptation of Major Barbara (1941).
