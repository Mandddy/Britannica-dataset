Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich,  (born November 10 [November 22, New Style], 1893, Kabany, near Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died July 25, 1991, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Soviet Communist Party leader and supporter of Joseph Stalin.
As a young Jewish shoemaker, Kaganovich became involved in the Bolshevik wing of the Russian Social Democratic Workers’ Party (in 1911) and in 1920 was made head of the Soviet government of Tashkent. His success in consolidating Soviet rule in Turkestan brought him to the attention of Stalin, who put him in charge of supervising the activities of local party organizations and, in 1924, of party patronage. Because his work in the latter capacity helped Stalin to defeat his political rivals and because he was a capable organizer and administrator, Kaganovich rose quickly in the party administration and by 1930 was a full member of the Politburo. He was one of the small group of Stalin’s top advisers pushing for very high rates of collectivization after 1929. As head of the Moscow regional party organization (1930–35), he brought it firmly under Stalin’s control. During this period he was also instrumental in the construction of the Moscow subway and the distribution of heavy farm equipment to shore up the failing collective system.
