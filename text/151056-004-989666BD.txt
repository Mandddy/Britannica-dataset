Zala, megye (county), western Hungary. It is bordered by the counties of Vas to the northwest, Veszprém to the northeast, and Somogy to the east and by Croatia to the south and Slovenia to the southwest. Zalaegerszeg is the county seat. Other major towns include Hévíz, Keszthely, Letenye, Nagykanizsa, Zalakaros, and Zalaszentgrót.
Three major features make up the landscape of Zala: the Transdanubian uplands, which are foothills to the Alps that lie across the western border; the Keszthely Mountains in the northeast; and the wooded, undulating Zala hills in the south and east. A small portion of Lake Balaton known as Keszthely Bay occupies a northeastern corner of the county. Zala’s major rivers include the Mura, which defines the southern frontier of Hungary; the Kerka, which runs through the county’s western hills; and the Zala, which flows into Lake Balaton. Vegetation mainly consists of beech forests, which are rich in game, and a patch of pinewood forest in the Göcsej hills. Wet meadows and pastures are found on the valley floors in the Zala hills.
