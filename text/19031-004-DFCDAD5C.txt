Stanley Kramer, in full Stanley Earl Kramer  (born September 29, 1913, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 19, 2001, Woodland Hills, California) American film producer and director who created unconventional, socially conscious works on a variety of issues not usually addressed in mainstream Hollywood fare.
Kramer graduated from high school at age 15 and earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration from New York University in 1933. Soon thereafter, he moved to Hollywood and entered the film industry, working as researcher, editor, and writer. During World War II, he served with the Army Signal Corps, where he made training and orientation films. Following the war, Kramer helped establish Screen Plays Inc., an independent production company. In 1948 its first motion picture, So This Is New York (directed by Richard Fleischer), was released. Kramer’s first success, Champion (directed by Mark Robson), followed in 1949. In dealing with the ruthlessness of an ambitious prizefighter and with corruption in boxing, the film noir established the moral tone that Kramer’s best-known future films would reflect. It also sparked the career of Kirk Douglas.
