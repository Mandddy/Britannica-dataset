Vine snake, any of several venomous, rear-fanged snakes of the family Colubridae that have slender bodies, narrow heads, and pointed snouts. Vine snakes typically belong to the genera Ahaetulla (Asian vine snakes), Oxybelis (New World vine snakes), and Thelotornis (African vine snakes); however, some authorities also place the genera Imantodes and Langaha in this group. African vine snakes, which inhabit sub-Saharan regions, are most diverse in East Africa. The five species of New World vine snakes range from Texas in the United States to Peru. Ahaetulla is a tropical Asian genus made up of eight species and distributed through India, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and the East Indies.
Vine snakes appear in two colours. Green species inhabit rainforest areas, and gray or brown species live primarily in savannas or dry forests. The body is laterally compressed and elongate, with the tail accounting for more than one-third of the total length, which typically varies between 0.75 and 1.5 metres (2.5 and 5 feet). Ahaetulla is unique in having a horizontal keyhole-shaped pupil and longitudinal grooves on the sides of its snout that enable acute, binocular vision. In contrast, Oxybelis has a round pupil, and Thelotornis has a horizontally elliptical pupil.
