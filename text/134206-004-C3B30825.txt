Ramón de Campoamor y Campoosorio,  (born Sept. 24, 1817, Navia, Spain—died  Feb. 12, 1901, Madrid) Spanish poet whose value lies in his expression of contemporary social attitudes.
After studying Latin and philosophy, he went to Madrid, in 1838, to pursue a degree in medicine but turned to literature instead. Although his two early books, Ternezas y floras (1840; “Endearments and Flowers”) and Ayes del alma (1842; “Laments of the Soul”), show the influence of the Spanish Romantic poet José y Moral Zorrilla, he broke away from Romanticism with his book Doloras (1845), simple verses of worldly wisdom much like proverbs, which were thought to herald a breakthrough into new poetic forms. Later he published Pequeños poemas (1871; “Little Poems”) and Humoradas (1886; “Pleasant Jokes”). Most of his verse contains little more than sentimental philosophy cloaked in a rhymed prose of affected simplicity.
