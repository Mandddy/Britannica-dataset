Bob Dole, byname of Robert Joseph Dole  (born July 22, 1923, Russell, Kansas, U.S.) American politician who served in the U.S. Senate (1969–96) and who was the Republican Party’s nominee for president in 1996 but lost to Bill Clinton.
Dole was born into a working-class family and left the University of Kansas to serve in the army during World War II. He became a second lieutenant and was seriously wounded during fighting in Italy. His recuperation from almost total paralysis took nearly four years, and, despite three major operations, he was left without the use of his right arm and hand. He returned to school and graduated with a law degree from Washburn Municipal University in Topeka, Kansas.
