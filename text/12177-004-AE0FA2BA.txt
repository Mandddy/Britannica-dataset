Francesco Durante,  (born March 31, 1684, Frattamaggiore, near Aversa [Italy]—died  Aug. 13, 1755, Naples) Italian composer of religious and instrumental music who was especially known for his teaching.
Durante studied in Rome and probably in Naples and in 1710 taught at the San Onofrio Conservatory. He was chapelmaster at the Conservatorio dei Poveri di Gesù Cristo in Naples (1728–39) and from 1742 taught at the Santa Maria di Loreto Conservatory (also in Naples). In 1745 he succeeded Leonardo Leo as principal teacher at San Onofrio. There was much rivalry between Leo’s students and his own pupils, among whom were many outstanding composers of the Neapolitan school of 18th-century opera: Jommelli, Piccinni, Pergolesi, Paisiello, Traetta, Vinci, and others. His compositions include motets, masses, oratorios, and a setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, as well as harpsichord pieces and music for strings.
