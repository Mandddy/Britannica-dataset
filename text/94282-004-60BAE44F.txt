Snake River, largest tributary of the Columbia River and one of the most important streams in the Pacific Northwest section of the United States. It rises in the mountains of the Continental Divide near the southeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming and flows south through Jackson Lake along the eastern base of the Teton Range in Grand Teton National Park. Swinging northwest near the mouth of Greys River, it enters Idaho through the Palisades Reservoir. Near Heise the river leaves the mountains and crosses the broad Snake River Plain of southern Idaho, an area covered by lava beds. On the western edge of the state, it is joined by the Boise River. Turning north, it forms the boundary between Idaho and Oregon for 216 miles (348 km). From the northeastern corner of Oregon it forms the Washington-Idaho boundary to Lewiston, Idaho, and then turns west to join the Columbia just south of Pasco, Washington, after a course of 1,040 miles (1,670 km).
Runoff from the states of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington combines in the Snake, which has a drainage basin of some 109,000 square miles (282,000 square km). From elevations of 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) the river descends to 300 feet (90 metres) at its outflow into the Columbia.
