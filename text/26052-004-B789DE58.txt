Bernardino Ramazzini,  (born Nov. 3, 1633, Carpi, duchy of Modena [Italy]—died  Nov. 5, 1714, Padua, Republic of Venice) Italian physician, considered a founder of occupational medicine.
A professor of medicine at the University of Modena (1682–1700), and an early student of epidemiology, he described outbreaks of lathyrism (1690; chick-pea poisoning) and malaria (1690–95) in Italy. A strong proponent of the use of cinchona bark in the treatment of malaria, Ramazzini recognized the introduction of this medicament (from which the alkaloid quinine is derived) as a revolutionary event in the history of medicine, completing the downfall of the classic Greek physician Galen’s medical theories advocating administration of purgatives in the treatment of disease.
