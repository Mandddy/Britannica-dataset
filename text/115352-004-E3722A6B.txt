Pauline Johnson, in full Emily Pauline Johnson   (born March 10, 1862, Six Nation Indian Reserve, Brant county, Upper Canada [now in Ontario]—died  March 7, 1913, Vancouver, B.C.) Canadian Indian poet who celebrated the heritage of her people in poems that had immense appeal in her lifetime.
The daughter of a Mohawk chief and an English mother, Johnson began publishing poetry in her teens. Using her Indian name, “Tekahionwake,” she toured Canada, England, and the United States, giving poetry recitals in a buckskin dress. Later she settled in Vancouver, where she wrote prose tales based on romanticized Indian life and legend: Legends of Vancouver (1911), The Shagganappi (1913), and The Moccasin Maker (1913). Her verse was collected as Flint and Feather (1912). Her poem “The Song My Paddle Sings” is familiar to all Canadian schoolchildren.
