Dibatag (Ammodorcas clarkei), also called Clark’s gazelle,  a rare member of the gazelle tribe (Antilopini, family Bovidae), indigenous to the Horn of Africa. The dibatag is sometimes mistaken for the related gerenuk.
A selective browser with a narrow, pointed snout, the dibatag is long-legged and long-necked. It stands 80–88 cm (31–35 inches) tall and weighs 22–29 kg (48–64 pounds). It is grayish brown in colour with ochre limbs and white cheek stripe, underparts, and rump. It also has a conspicuous black tail that is held erect during flight. Only males have horns, which are short (25 cm [10 inches]) and curved forward.
