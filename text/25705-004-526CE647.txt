Philip, byname Philip The Magnanimous, German Philipp Der Grossmütige  (born Nov. 13, 1504, Marburg, Hesse [Germany]—died  March 31, 1567, Kassel) landgrave (Landgraf) of Hesse (1509–67), one of the great figures of German Protestantism, who championed the independence of German princes against the Holy Roman emperor Charles V.
Philip was the son of Landgrave William II, a cultivated, austere man and an experienced soldier. He died when Philip was barely five years old. Philip’s mother, Duchess Anna of Mecklenburg, was a passionate, energetic, and ambitious woman; her relations with her son, however, were cool and were impaired by her second marriage in 1519 and by Philip’s conversion to the doctrines of Martin Luther. As a victim of political forces he spent a gloomy youth, attaching himself increasingly to his older sister Elizabeth, later duchess of Saxony; throughout his life no one was closer to him than she.
