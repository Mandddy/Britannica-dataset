Frederick Temple,  (born November 30, 1821, Levkás, Greece—died  December 23, 1902, London, England) archbishop of Canterbury and educational reformer who was sometimes considered to personify, by his rugged appearance and terse manner as a schoolmaster and bishop, the ideal of “manliness” fashionable during the Victorian era (1837–1901) in Britain.
Ordained a priest in 1847, Temple left his position as a lecturer at the University of Oxford, where he had been educated, in 1848 to work in the national Education Office. From 1850 to 1855 he was principal of Kneller Hall Training College and from 1855 to 1857 was a government inspector of schools. On the recommendation of the English poet Matthew Arnold, whose father, Thomas Arnold, had been a reformer at Rugby, Temple was appointed headmaster of the school in 1857. While serving simultaneously as Queen Victoria’s chaplain, he expanded the Rugby curriculum, especially in the areas of history, science, and music, and commissioned several new buildings.
