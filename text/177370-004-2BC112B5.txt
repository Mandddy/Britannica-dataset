Dimetrodon (genus Dimetrodon), extinct relative of primitive mammals that is characterized by a large, upright, sail-like structure on its back. Dimetrodon lived from about 286 million to 270 million years ago, during the Permian Period, and fossils of the animal have been found in North America.
Dimetrodon was a carnivore that grew to a length of more than 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) and had a large “sail” on its back that may have functioned in temperature regulation. The sail was presumably formed by elongated vertebral spines connected by a membrane containing many blood vessels. The skull of Dimetrodon was high and narrow, and the region in front of the eyes was long. Its many teeth were differentiated into several sizes.
