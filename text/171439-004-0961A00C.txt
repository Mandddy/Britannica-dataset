Mary Quant, in full Dame Mary Quant  (born February 11, 1934?, London, England) English dress designer of youth-oriented fashions, responsible in the 1960s for the “Chelsea look” of England and the widespread popularity of the miniskirt and “hot pants.”
Quant attended Goldsmith’s College of Art, London, and spent two years designing hats for the Danish milliner Erik. In partnership with her husband and a friend, she opened a boutique, called Bazaar, on the King’s Road in London in 1957. It was an immediate success, and within seven years the company had expanded throughout Europe and the United States and was mass-producing designs on a multimillion-dollar annual scale.
