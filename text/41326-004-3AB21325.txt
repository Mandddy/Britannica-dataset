Sourwood, also called sorrel,  (species Oxydendrum arboreum), deciduous ornamental tree, of the heath family (Ericaceae), native to southeastern North America. It grows to about 23 metres (75 feet) in height. The bitter-tasting leaves are alternate, stalked, rather oblong, and 12–20 cm (5–8 inches) long. In the autumn the leaves turn a brilliant red. The pendulous fragrant white flowers, about 1 cm (0.4 inch) long, grow in clusters 20–25 cm (8–10 inches) in length; the flowers are replaced by erect whitish capsular fruits, which make a pleasant contrast with the leaves.
