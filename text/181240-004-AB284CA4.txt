Gavrila Romanovich Derzhavin,  (born July 3 [July 14, New Style], 1743, Kazan province, Russia—died  July 8 [July 20], 1816, Zvanka, Novgorod province, Russia) Russia’s greatest and most original 18th-century poet, whose finest achievements lie in his lyrics and odes.
Born of impoverished nobility, Derzhavin joined the army as a common soldier in 1762 and was made an officer in 1772. In 1777 he entered the civil service in St. Petersburg, and during the next 26 years his posts included those of provincial governor at Olonets and Tambov, senator, and minister of justice. His Oda k Felitse (1782; “Ode to Felicia”), addressed to Catherine the Great, gained her favour, and he was briefly her private secretary. His liberal political inclinations put an end to his career in 1803, at which time he retired to his estate at Zvanka.
