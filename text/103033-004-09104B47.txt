Louth, Irish LÃº,  county, in the province of Leinster, northeastern Ireland. The smallest county in area in Ireland, it is bounded by Northern Ireland (north), the Irish Sea (east), County Meath (south and west), and County Monaghan (northwest). Dundalk, in northern Louth, is the county town (seat), and there is a county manager.
Most of Louth is part of a central lowland, generally about 200 feet (60 metres) above sea level, and occurrences of glacial drift are found everywhere. Only one-eighth of the county is unimproved land, of which the largest stretch is in the mountains of the Carlingford Peninsula in the northeast. Many patches of peat bog have been cleared and the land used for pasture and crops.
