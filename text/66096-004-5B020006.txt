City Lights, American silent romantic-comedy film, released in 1931, that was considered by many to be Charlie Chaplinâ€™s crowning achievement in the cinema.
In this simple story the Tramp (played by Chaplin) befriends a poor blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) and convinces her that he is a wealthy man. Through his generosity, she finally receives the operation that restores her sight, but by then the tragedy-prone Tramp is doing a stretch in prison. In the famous final sequence, the Tramp pays a visit to her flower shop. Her gradual realization that this pathetic man is her true benefactor has been called one of the most touching moments in film history.
