San Juan River, Spanish Río San Juan, also called Desaguadero,  river and outlet of Lake Nicaragua, issuing from the lake’s southeastern end at the Nicaraguan city of San Carlos and flowing along the Nicaragua–Costa Rica border into the Caribbean Sea at the Nicaraguan port of San Juan del Norte. It receives the San Carlos and Sarapiquí rivers during its 124-mile (199-km) southeasterly course through tropical forests, and near its mouth it forms three branches: the Juanillo Menor to the north, the Colorado River to the south, and the San Juan proper.
Navigation is impeded by rapids at the villages of Toro, El Castillo, and Machuca and is limited to boats with a shallow draft. During the migrations to California from the eastern United States between 1850 and 1870, travellers transferred at San Juan del Norte from Atlantic steamers to small boats, which went up the river and across Lake Nicaragua; they then travelled overland to the Pacific port of San Juan del Sur. Along with the lake, the San Juan River has been considered for a possible canal route between the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean.
