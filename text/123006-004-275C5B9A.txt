Fuchun River, Chinese (Pinyin) Fuchun Jiang, or (Wade-Giles romanization) Fu-ch’un Chiang,  river flowing through Zhejiang province, southeastern China. The lower course and estuary, which discharge at Hangzhou into Hangzhou Bay, are called the Qiantang River. Above Hangzhou, as far as Tonglu, it is called the Fuchun River, and the section above Tonglu is known as the Tong River. Near Jiande the main river is formed by the junction of two separate river systems.
The westerly system is the Xin’an River, which flows from southern Anhui province, where it rises in the Huang Mountains near Shexian. This tributary flows through deep, gorgelike valleys in the rugged, hilly country of the Anhui-Zhejiang border. In the late 1950s a dam and hydroelectric project was started (completed 1977) on the river near its confluence with the Fuchun, forming the large Xin’an River Reservoir.
