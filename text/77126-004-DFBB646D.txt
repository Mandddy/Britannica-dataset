Robert Duvall, in full Robert Seldon Duvall  (born January 5, 1931, San Diego, California, U.S.) American actor noted for his ability to quietly inhabit any character, particularly average working people, bringing them fully but subtly to life. In the words of critic Elaine Mancini, Duvall was “the most technically proficient, the most versatile, and the most convincing actor on the screen in the United States.”
Born to a U.S. Navy admiral, Duvall graduated from Illinois’s Principia College in 1953 and served two years in the army during the Korean War. In the years that followed, he studied drama under the noted acting teacher Sanford Meisner at New York’s Neighborhood Playhouse and appeared in Off-Broadway and Broadway plays.
