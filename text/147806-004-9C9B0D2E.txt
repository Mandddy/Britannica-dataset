Brian Jones,  (born March 27, 1947, Bristol, Eng.) British aviator who on March 20, 1999, with captain Bertrand Piccard, completed the first nonstop circumnavigation of the globe by balloon. The trip, begun by Jones and Piccard on March 1 aboard the Breitling Orbiter 3, took 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes to complete. Starting in the Swiss Alps, the balloon carried the pair over Europe, Africa, Asia, Central America, and the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Jones learned to fly at age 16 and left school early for a 13-year stint in the Royal Air Force. Although he did not get involved in ballooning until 1986, by 1989 he had acquired a balloon-flying license and become an instructor. He served as project manager of a number of Breitling missions, overseeing construction of the craft. He was originally designated as a third copilot of Breitling Orbiter 3 but became Piccardâ€™s sole copilot after Wim Verstraeten and another pilot backed out of the flight.
