Buffalo, city and port, seat (1821) of Erie county, western New York, U.S. It is located where the eastern end of Lake Erie narrows into the Niagara River. New York’s second largest city, it is the metropolis of a large urban complex that includes the cities of Lackawanna, Lockport, Niagara Falls, and Tonawanda–North Tonawanda, as well as the towns (townships) of Amherst, Cheektowaga, Hamburg, Lancaster, and West Seneca. Lake Erie strongly affects Buffalo’s climate, moderating summer and winter temperatures and contributing much of the moisture that produces the city’s renowned heavy winter snowfalls. Area city, 53 square miles (137 square km). Pop. (2000) 292,648; Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metro Area, 1,170,111; (2010) 261,310; Buffalo–Niagara Falls Metro Area, 1,135,509.
Buffalo’s site, at the natural junction of east-west transportation routes from the Hudson-Mohawk river valleys to the Great Lakes basin, was visited by early French trappers and Jesuit missionaries. It was there on the banks of the Niagara River that the explorer René-Robert Cavelier, sieur (lord) de La Salle, built his ship the Griffon in 1679. A French trading post under Chabert Joncaire was established in 1758 but was abandoned the following year after it was burned by the British. Seneca Indians under British protection settled the area in 1780. The town was laid out in 1803–04 by Joseph Ellicott of the Holland Land Company. Named New Amsterdam (but popularly called Buffalo), it had a population of about 1,500 at the time of the War of 1812 and became the American military headquarters for operations on the Niagara frontier. It was again burned by the British in 1813 but was rebuilt and incorporated as the village of Buffalo in 1816. The origin of the place-name is in dispute, as buffalo (bison) did not inhabit the area; it may reflect a mispronunciation of the French beau fleuve (“beautiful river”), in reference to the local Buffalo Creek.
