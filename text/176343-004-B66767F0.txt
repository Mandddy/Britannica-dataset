Strangers on a Train, American thriller film, released in 1951, that was produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock and based on the novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith. Raymond Chandler cowrote the film’s screenplay.
Tennis star Guy Haines (played by Farley Granger) meets a stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), on a train. The two men swap their life stories and commiserate over their personal troubles, whereupon Anthony suggests an idea for the perfect murder: each man will kill the bothersome person in the other man’s life. Since the men are strangers, no one, suggests Anthony, will suspect the other of the crime. Haines does not take him seriously, and when the two men part, he is sure that he will never hear from Anthony again. Anthony, however, believing that the men had an agreement, proceeds to kill Haines’s wife, whereupon he expects Haines to uphold his end of the “bargain”: to kill Anthony’s father.
