Jungle fowl, any of four Asian birds of the genus Gallus, family Phasianidae (order Galliformes). (For Australian jungle fowl, see megapode.) Gallus species differ from other members of the pheasant family in having, in the male, a fleshy comb, lobed wattles hanging below the bill, and high-arched tail. The red jungle fowl (G. gallus) is the ancestor of the domestic fowl. The cock has shining silky plumage, red on the head and back and green-black elsewhere—a pattern seen also in several domestic breeds; the hen is rusty brown with speckled neck and minimal comb. Males meet in a selected arena—natural precursor of the gamecock pit (see cockfighting)—where they use their sharp leg spurs in combat, often to the death. In courtship display, the male droops one wing and tilts his head, mantle, and back—his most colourful parts—toward the hen; the domestic rooster behaves similarly. Jungle fowl seem to be monogamous under normal circumstances. The hen lays 5–8 buffy eggs at a time.
The gray jungle fowl (G. sonnerati), of southern India, may also have contributed to the ancestry of the domestic fowl, which in some breeds shows a similar grayish and white pattern. Other species inhabit parts of India and are found also in Sri Lanka (Ceylon), Java, and some Indonesian islands.
