Giovanni Paisiello,  Paisiello also spelled Paesiello   (born May 9, 1740, Roccaforzata, near Taranto, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died  June 5, 1816, Naples) Neapolitan composer of operas admired for their robust realism and dramatic power.
Paisiello’s father, who intended him for the legal profession, enrolled him at age five in the Jesuit school in Taranto. When his talent for singing became obvious, he was placed in the Conservatory of San Onofrio at Naples. For the theatre of the conservatory he wrote some intermezzi, one of which attracted so much notice that he was invited to write two operas, La Pupilla (“The Female Pupil”), for Bologna, and Il Marchese Tulissano, for Rome. His reputation established, he settled for some years at Naples, where he produced a series of successful operas. In 1776 Paisiello was invited by the Russian empress Catherine II to St. Petersburg, where he remained for eight years. Among the works he produced for Catherine was Il Barbiere di Siviglia (1782; The Barber of Seville), which some consider his masterpiece, on a libretto by Giuseppe Petrosellini, after Beaumarchais’s comedy Le Barbier de Séville.
