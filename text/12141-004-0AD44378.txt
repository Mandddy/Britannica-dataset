Pierce Egan, the Elder,  (born 1772, London, Eng.—died  Aug. 3, 1849, London) sporting writer whose works were considered indispensable reading for English men-about-town in the early 19th century.
Egan made his reputation as a boxing reporter. His best-known work is Boxiana (1818–24), a racy but accurate account of the lives of famous pugilists. Egan also became an authority on other sports and developed a flair for sensational literature describing the contemporary “fast” life.
