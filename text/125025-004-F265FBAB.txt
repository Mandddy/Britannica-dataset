Stilwell Road, original name Ledo Road,  highway 478 mi (769 km) long that links northeastern India with the Burma Road, which runs from Burma to China. During World War II the Stilwell Road was a strategic military route.
U.S. Army engineers began construction of the highway in December 1942 to link the railheads of Ledo (Assam, now in Arunachal Pradesh, India) and Mogaung (Burma), and Chinese troops later aided in the project.
