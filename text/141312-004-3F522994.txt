Dragonet, any of about 40 species of marine fishes constituting the family Callionymidae (order Perciformes), found in warm temperate or tropical areas, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Dragonets characteristically have large and elongated fins, large, flattened heads, and small gills that are mere rounded openings. Dragonets are scaleless. The males may be brightly coloured once sexually mature, in contrast to the usually drab females. Most species are bottom dwellers, frequently burying themselves in sand in shallow areas. A few species are found in deep waters, however. The eggs are pelagic, floating in the open water until they hatch.
