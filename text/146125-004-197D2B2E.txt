Bighorn River,  largest tributary of the Yellowstone River, draining west-central Wyoming and a small area of south-central Montana, U.S. Topographically, it includes three subbasins, known in downstream order as the Wind River in Wyoming, the Big Horn in Wyoming and Montana, and the Lower Big Horn in Montana.
Wind River, master stream of the upper basin, originates in the high areas of the Wind River and Absaroka Mountains in northwestern Wyoming. Flowing southeastward to a lowland area in west-central Wyoming, it is joined by the Popo Agie River and Little Wind rivers near Riverton. Turning north, it passes out of the upper basin through Wind River Canyon, a deep, spectacular gorge through the Owl Creek Mountains. Boysen Dam is located in the southern section of the canyon. North of the canyon the stream becomes the Bighorn River. Continuing northward it flows through the Big Horn Basin—collecting its two principal tributaries, the Greybull and Shoshone rivers—to the Wyoming-Montana boundary, where it turns northeastward through Bighorn Canyon to cross the Lower Big Horn Basin and empty into the Yellowstone River at Bighorn, Mont., after a course of 461 miles (742 km). There are major irrigation projects on the river at Riverton and Bighorn. The Little Bighorn River, site of the Custer Battlefield National Monument, joins the main stream at Hardin, Mont. The Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area stretches along Bighorn Canyon on both sides of the border.
