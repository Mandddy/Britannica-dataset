Passaic, county, northeastern New Jersey, U.S., bordered by New York state to the north and the Pequannock and Pompton rivers to the south; the Passaic River, which crosses the southeastern portion of the county, forms part of the southern and eastern borders. The terrain of the rural northwestern arm of the county is more rugged than that of the populous southeastern arm; the northwest also has numerous lakes. Oak and hickory trees predominate throughout the county. Recreational areas include Wanaque Reservoir, Greenwood Lake, Ringwood and Wawayanda state parks, and Abram S. Hewitt and Norvin Green state forests.
Algonquian-speaking Delaware Indians were early inhabitants of the region. Iron mining began in the mid-18th century. By the mid-19th century the county was known for its silks, locomotives, and cotton sails. In 1791 statesman Alexander Hamilton chose Paterson, later the county seat, as the site of the nationâ€™s first planned industrial community. Along with nearby Haledon, Paterson was important to the development of the labour movement. The William Paterson College of New Jersey in Wayne was established in 1855. Located in the Ramapo Mountains, the lavish Ringwood Manor was built by Abram Stevens Hewitt, a local ironmaster.
