Lymphogranuloma venereum, also called lymphogranuloma inguinale or Nicolas-Favre disease,  infection of lymph vessels and lymph nodes by the microorganism Chlamydia trachomatis. Like chlamydia, which is also a disease caused by C. trachomatis, lymphogranuloma venereum is usually sexually transmitted. The disease produces swollen lymph nodes, ulcerations, enlargement of genital organs, and rectal stricture. Lymphogranuloma venereum occurs throughout most of the world, especially in tropical and subtropical areas.
The primary lesion, usually on the genitalia, appears from 3 to 21 days after infection. The lesion is often so transitory as to escape notice, and the first noticeable manifestation of the disease may be a hot, tender swelling of lymph nodes (buboes) in the groin, appearing from 10 to 30 days after exposure. Fever, chills, headache, and joint pains may be present. Abscess formation with drainage of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes is common. Later manifestations of the disease include secondary ulceration and elephantiasis (enlargement) of the genitalia in men, polyps around the anus, inflammation, ulceration, and stricture of the rectum, and, in rare cases, arthritis, conjunctivitis, and nervous system involvement. The course of the disease varies from asymptomatic infection to extreme debilitation. Treatment is with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
