Cordon bleu,  any of three species of birds belonging to the genus (or subgenus) Uraeginthus of the waxbill family Estrildidae (order Passeriformes). The birds, including some popular cage birds, are native to Africa, where they frequent villages and farms. A widespread species is the 13-centimetre (5-inch) red-cheeked cordon bleu (U. bengalus), occurring from Senegal and Congo (Kinshasa) to Somalia and Zimbabwe. It is brown and pale blue, with red cheek spot (in the male only) and longish pointed tail. The two other species are the blue-capped cordon bleu (U. cyanocephalus) and the Angola cordon bleu (U. angolensis), also called the Angola waxbill, or blue-breasted waxbill.
