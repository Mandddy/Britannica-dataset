George Cruikshank,  (born September 27, 1792, London, England—died February 1, 1878, London) English artist, caricaturist, and illustrator who, beginning his career with satirical political cartoons and later illustrating topical and children’s books, became one of the most prolific and popular masters of his art.
His father was Isaac Cruikshank (1756?–1811), a popular illustrator and caricaturist. In 1811, when George was still in his teens, he gained popular success with a series of political caricatures that he created for the periodical The Scourge, a Monthly Expositor of Imposture and Folly. This publication lasted until 1816, during which time Cruikshank came to rival James Gillray, the leading English caricaturist of the preceding generation. For the next 10 years Cruikshank satirized with fine irreverence the political policies of the Tories and the Whigs.
