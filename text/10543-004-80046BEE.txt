Kauri pine, also called Dammar Pine,   (Agathis australis), a resinous timber conifer of the family Araucariaceae, native to the North Island of New Zealand. The tree sometimes reaches 45 metres (150 feet) in height, with a diameter up to 7 m (23 ft).
Kauri resin, obtained from this and other Agathis species, is an amber-like deposit dug from the sites of previous forests; the hard, durable resin, called kauri copal, kauri gum, or dammar, is used in making varnishes, lacquers, and linoleum.
