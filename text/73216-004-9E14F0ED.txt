Great Observatories, a semiformal grouping of four U.S. satellite observatories that had separate origins: the Hubble Space Telescope, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. The grouping came about because the four would provide unprecedented spatial and temporal coverage across much of the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma rays (Compton) through X-rays (Chandra) and visible light (Hubble) to the infrared (Spitzer).
The Great Observatories concept was developed in the mid-1980s by American engineer Charles Pellerin, then Director of Astrophysics at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as a way of providing an umbrella for four large, expensive astrophysics missions that otherwise might be viewed as funding competitors. The idea was that by spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, the four would offer a comprehensive view of the universe that would help unify heretofore diverse perceptions. Comparisons were made between hearing an entire symphony rather than a solo instrument. In 1985 NASA introduced the program to the public in a full-colour booklet, The Great Observatories for Space Astrophysics, which was written by American astronomer Martin Harwit and American science writer Valerie Neal.
