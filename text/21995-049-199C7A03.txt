Germination, the sprouting of a seed, spore, or other reproductive body, usually after a period of dormancy (see afterripening). The absorption of water, the passage of time, chilling, warming, oxygen availability, and light exposure may all operate in initiating the process.
Germination sometimes occurs early in the development process; the mangrove (Rhizophora) embryo develops within the ovule, pushing out a swollen rudimentary root through the still-attached flower. In peas and corn (maize) the cotyledons (seed leaves) remain underground (e.g., hypogeal germination), while in other species (beans, sunflowers, etc.) the hypocotyl (embryonic stem) grows several inches above the ground, carrying the cotyledons into the light, in which they become green and often leaflike (e.g., epigeal germination). The carefully controlled mass germination of cereal seeds supplies enzymes for the making of alcoholic beverages and for other industries as well. Spores of the commercially cultivated edible mushroom Agaricus brunescens are also mass germinated.
