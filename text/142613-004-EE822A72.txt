Hyderabad, former princely state of south-central India that was centred on the city of Hyderabad.
It was founded by Nizam al-Mulk (Āṣaf Jāh), who was intermittently viceroy of the Deccan (peninsular India) under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721 and who resumed the post again under the title Āṣaf Jāh in 1724. At that time he became virtually independent and founded the dynasty of the nizams (rulers) of Hyderabad. The British and the French participated in the wars of succession that followed his death in 1748.
