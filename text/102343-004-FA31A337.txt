Leopold Mozart, in full Johann Georg Leopold Mozart  (born Nov. 14, 1719, Augsburg [Germany]—died  May 28, 1787, Salzburg, Archbishopric of Salzburg [Austria]) Austrian violinist, teacher, and composer, the father and principal teacher of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Leopold Mozart became a violinist at the court of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg and rose through the orchestra’s ranks to become court composer (1757) and (1762) vice chapelmaster. His treatise setting forth his method of teaching, Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule (A Treatise on the Fundamental Principles of Violin Playing), coincidentally published in 1756, the year of Wolfgang’s birth, was long a standard text and was widely reprinted and translated. Among his musical compositions are concerti for various instruments, symphonies, and other pieces.
