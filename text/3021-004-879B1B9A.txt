Niederösterreich, English Lower Austria,  Bundesland (federal state), northeastern Austria. It is bordered by the Czech Republic on the north, Slovakia on the east, and by Bundesländer Burgenland on the southeast, Steiermark (Styria) on the south, and Oberösterreich (Upper Austria) on the west. Niederösterreich Bundesland surrounds but does not include Austria’s largest city and national capital, Vienna, which is a separate administrative entity.
The Bundesland is roughly bisected by the Danube River, which flows from west to east through it. The borders of the state are demarcated by the mouths of the Enns River on the west and the March River on the east as they join the Danube River. Niederösterreich has an area of 7,403 square miles (19,174 square km).
