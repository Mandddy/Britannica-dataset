Clinton Joseph Davisson,  (born Oct. 22, 1881, Bloomington, Ill., U.S.â€”died  Feb. 1, 1958, Charlottesville, Va.) American experimental physicist who shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937 with George P. Thomson of England for discovering that electrons can be diffracted like light waves, thus verifying the thesis of Louis de Broglie that electrons behave both as waves and as particles.
Davisson received his doctorate from Princeton University and spent most of his career at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. He began his research there on the emissions of electrons from a metal in the presence of heat and later helped develop the electron microscope.
