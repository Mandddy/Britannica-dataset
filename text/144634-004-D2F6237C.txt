Ol Doinyo Lengai, active volcano, northern Tanzania, East Africa, located at the southern end of Lake Natron. It rises to an elevation of 9,442 feet (2,878 metres) and is one of the many volcanoes situated along the East African Rift System. Ol Doinyo Lengai (“Mountain of God”) contains basalts rich in sodium and potassium, and is so alkaline that its lavas resemble washing soda. Eruptions have been recorded from 1880 to 1967. The volcano has more than one active centre and most of the recent eruptions were from its northern crater. Subsidiary cones extend out from the centre and down its sides. The fertile lower levels of the Ol Doinyo Lengai are planted in vineyards and citrus. The steep higher slopes are covered with oak, birch, and beech. Above 6,500 feet a few plants are found scattered among ashes, sand, and fragments of lava and slag.
