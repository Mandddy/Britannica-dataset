John Hookham Frere, pseudonym William and Robert Whistlecraft   (born May 21, 1769, London, Eng.—died  Jan. 7, 1846, Valletta, Malta) British diplomat and man of letters.
Frere was educated at Eton, where he met the future statesman George Canning (with whom he collaborated on The Anti-Jacobin), and at the University of Cambridge. He entered the Foreign Office, in 1799 becoming undersecretary of state for foreign affairs and in 1800 going to Portugal as envoy extraordinary. His diplomatic career ended disastrously in 1808, when he was blamed for endangering the British army by advising its commander, Sir John Moore, against retreat from the French to La Coruña, Spain. He was recalled and spent the rest of his life in retirement, residing in Malta after 1820.
