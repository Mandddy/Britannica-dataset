Stand Watie, also called De Gata Ga (Cherokee: “Stand Firm”)  (born December 12, 1806, Rome, Georgia, U.S.—died September 9, 1871, Honey Creek, Indian Territory [now Oklahoma]) Cherokee chief who signed the treaty forcing tribal removal of the Cherokees from Georgia and who later served as brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the U.S. Civil War. Watie learned to speak English when, at the age of 12, he was sent to a mission school. He later helped an older brother publish the Cherokee Phoenix, a tribal newspaper.
In 1835 Watie joined three other Cherokee leaders in signing the treaty of New Echota, surrendering Cherokee lands in Georgia and forcing the tribe to move westward into Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). On the same day in 1839, all three other signers were murdered, but Watie escaped death and remained leader of the minority favouring the treaty.
