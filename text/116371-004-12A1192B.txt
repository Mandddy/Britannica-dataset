Georgia Southern was founded in 1906, with instruction beginning two years later. The university was then known as the First District Agricultural and Mechanical School. In 1924 the name was changed to Georgia Normal School when the school’s mission was directed toward training teachers. In 1929 the school became the South Georgia Teachers College and in 1939, Georgia Teachers College. Graduate instruction began in 1957, and in 1959 the school was renamed Georgia Southern College, as its curriculum had expanded beyond teacher training. Georgia Southern was elevated to university standing in 1990.
