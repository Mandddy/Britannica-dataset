Paul II, original name Pietro Barbo   (born Feb. 23, 1417, Venice—died July 26, 1471, Rome) Italian pope from 1464 to 1471.
He was bishop of the Italian cities of Cervia and Vicenza before being made cardinal by Pope Eugenius IV in 1440. After services in the Curia under popes Nicholas V and Calixtus III, he became governor of Campania in 1456. Elected Pope Pius II’s successor on Aug. 30, 1464, he immediately declared that “capitulations,” or binding agreements that determined the subsequent conduct of elected prelates, could affect a new pope only as counsels, not as obligations, investing the papacy with an autocratic tone that was to persist throughout his pontificate. His refusal to pursue reform antagonized some of the cardinals.
