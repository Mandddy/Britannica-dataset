Kiang (Equus kiang), species of Asian wild ass found in the cold, arid highlands of Nepal, India, and Pakistan and in Qinghai and Gansu provinces and the western Tibet Autonomous Region in China at elevations above 4,000 metres (13,000 feet). The kiangâ€™s coat is reddish in summer and brown, and it has white underparts that do not change with the seasons. The kiang is the largest species of wild ass; it stands 140 cm (55 inches) at the shoulder and weighs between 250 and 440 kg (550 and 970 pounds). In some areas, populations have declined due to competition with livestock; however, in areas where they do not compete with humans, the kiang has thrived.
