Dan Rather, original name Dan Irvin Rather  (born October 31, 1931, Wharton, Texas, U.S.) American newscaster and author who covered some of the most important historical events of his time, including the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the Watergate Scandal, during his four decades with CBS.
Rather grew up in Texas, where his father laid pipeline for oil fields. The family eventually settled in a working-class neighbourhood in Houston. Following through on childhood aspirations of becoming a reporter, Rather enrolled in Sam Houston State Teachers College (now Sam Houston State University), where he studied journalism (B.A. 1953). While still a student, Rather landed his first broadcasting job, at a small local radio station in Huntsville, Texas. He subsequently worked at KTRH-Radio in Houston, and in 1960 he became director of news and public affairs at KHOU-TV, CBSâ€™s Houston affiliate. The following year his live coverage of Hurricane Carla caught the attention of network executives, who offered him a job as a CBS correspondent. He began working for CBS in March 1962.
