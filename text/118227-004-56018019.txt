Huon pine, also called Macquarie pine,  (Lagarostrobos franklinii), gray-barked conifer of the family Podocarpaceae. It is found along Tasmanian river systems at altitudes of 150 to 600 metres (500–2,000 feet). The tree is straight-trunked, pyramidal, 21 to 30 metres (70 to 100 feet) tall, and 0.7 to 1 metre (2 to 3 feet) in diameter. The Huon pine’s fragrant, soft wood is used for furniture and cabinetry. An oil obtained from the wood is used as a paint preservative.
