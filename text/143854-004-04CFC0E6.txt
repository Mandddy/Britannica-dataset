Eric Rohmer, original name Jean-Marie-Maurice Scherer   (born April 4, 1920, Nancy, France—died Jan. 11, 2010, Paris) French motion-picture director and writer noted for his sensitively observed studies of romantic passion.
Rohmer, who first earned an advanced degree in history and taught school for a short time, began his writing career in the mid-1940s. After moving to Paris, he started to write film criticism for French periodicals. He was a founding editor of La Gazette du cinéma in 1950, along with François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Jacques Rivette, and he became editor in chief of the New Wave publication Cahiers du cinéma in 1957. That year he and Claude Chabrol coauthored the film study Hitchcock. In 1963 he quit Cahiers after becoming involved in a dispute.
