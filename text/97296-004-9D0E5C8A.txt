Music festival, usually a series of performances at a particular place and inspired by a unifying theme, such as national music, modern music, or the promotion of a prominent composer’s works. It may also take the form of a competition for performers or composers.
Series of religious services associated with a given feast early established the idea of the music festival in the church. The term festival in its modern sense, however, was first used in England. The Festival of the Sons of the Clergy, originally an annual charity sermon, was first given at St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, in 1655; it took on a musical character in 1698. The famed Three Choirs Festival was established in 1724 (an earlier form existed in 1715) and continues to take place annually and in rotation at the cathedral cities of Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford. Harp festivals were held in Ireland toward the end of the 18th century.
