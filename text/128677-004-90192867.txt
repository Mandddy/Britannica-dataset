Pulmonary fibrosis, end result of a variety of inflammatory diseases of the lungs in which dense fibrous connective tissue replaces lung tissue. The fibrous tissue stiffens the lungs, reduces space available for inhaled air, and interferes with gas exchange. Pulmonary fibrosis causes a dry cough and shortness of breath upon physical exertion. The condition can progress to respiratory failure. Causes of pulmonary fibrosis include sarcoidosis, radiation therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, certain drugs, genetic predisposition, and environmental or occupational exposure to harmful irritants such as asbestos. However, in many cases the cause is unknown, and thus the disease is referred to as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
