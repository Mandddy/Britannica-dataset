Dame Maggie Smith, original name Margaret Natalie Smith  (born December 28, 1934, Ilford, Essex, England) English stage and motion-picture actress, noted for her poignancy and wit in comic roles.
Smith studied acting at the Oxford Playhouse School and began appearing in revues in Oxford in 1952 and London in 1955. She first achieved recognition in the Broadway revue New Faces of 1956 and held the lead comedian role in the London revue Share My Lettuce (1957–58). She then began appearing regularly in plays at the Old Vic theatre in London. Her work in Jean Anouilh’s The Rehearsal (1961), Peter Shaffer’s linked comedies The Private Ear and The Public Eye (1962), and Jean Kerr’s Mary, Mary (1963) solidified her reputation. In 1963 Smith joined Britain’s National Theatre company, and the following year she played Desdemona opposite Laurence Olivier’s Othello. She repeated that role in Olivier’s motion-picture version of Othello in 1965 and further appeared with the National Theatre in such roles as Silvia in George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer (1963).
