Keith Olbermann,  (born January 27, 1959, New York City, New York, U.S.) American television journalist, liberal political commentator, and sportscaster, best known as the host of the nightly news and analysis program Countdown with Keith Olbermann (2003–11) on the cable news network MSNBC.
Olbermann grew up in Westchester county, New York, and attended Cornell University in Ithaca, where he graduated in 1979 with a B.S. in communications. At Cornell he was the sports director for Ithaca’s student-run commercial radio station, WVBR. He worked briefly as a newswire sports reporter, eventually joining the Cable News Network (CNN) in 1981. After a short stint in 1984 as a sports anchor for the Boston television station WCVB, he relocated to Los Angeles, where he spent the next five years working as a radio sports broadcaster, garnering 11 Golden Mike Awards and being named Best Sportscaster of the Year three times. Olbermann’s audience widened in 1992 when he became a cohost of ESPN’s SportsCenter, a position he held until 1997, when he became the host of his own newscast, The Big Show with Keith Olbermann, on MSNBC. He left the network in frustration after his show was renamed White House in Crisis and dedicated to covering the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In 1998 he joined Fox Sports Net as anchor of the weekly sportscast The Keith Olbermann Show, but in 2001 he was fired after he reported that Rupert Murdoch—head of the Fox Broadcasting Company—was seeking to sell the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. Olbermann spent the next two years working as a sportscaster for the ABC (American Broadcasting Company) radio network.
