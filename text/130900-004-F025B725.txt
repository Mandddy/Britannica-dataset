Pelota, (
        Spanish: “ball”, ) also called Pilota, or Pelote Basque,  any of a number of glove, racket, or bat court games requiring a rubber-cored ball. These games arose from the old French game known as jeux de paume. Varieties of this game are played in many parts of the world.
The variations of pelota can be classified as either jeux directs—games in which the players face each other and the pelota is hit freely between opponents—or jeux indirects—games in which the ball is hit off a wall. The second class has many variations, including bare-hand (main nue), the most popular. Pelota courts include the one-walled place libre, the two- or three-walled fronton, and the small, covered court, called the trinquet. The surfaces of these courts range from dirt to highly polished cement.
