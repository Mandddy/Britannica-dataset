Biathlon, winter sport combining cross-country skiing with rifle marksmanship.
The sport is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the Norse god Ull as both the ski god and the hunting god. Ull’s goddess wife Skadi was also celebrated as a hunter-skier. The combined skills of skiing and rifle marksmanship were first developed by the region’s militaries. Documents describe Norwegian and Swedish ski units fighting in the Second Northern War (1700–21), and, in 1767, the first recorded biathlon competition took place along the Norway-Sweden border between patrol companies. The sport was thought to provide valuable training as well as recreation. In 1861 the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club, the first biathlon club, was established in Norway, and thereafter similar clubs were found throughout northern Europe.
