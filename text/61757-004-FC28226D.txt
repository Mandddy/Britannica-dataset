Leo McCarey, in full Thomas Leo McCarey  (born October 3, 1898, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died July 5, 1969, Santa Monica, California) American director and writer who was perhaps best known for his light comedies, notably the classics Duck Soup (1933) and The Awful Truth (1937), but who also made several popular romances and sentimental films.
McCarey graduated from the University of Southern California law school and practiced briefly before he broke into films in 1918 as an assistant to director Tod Browning. By 1924 he was directing Charley Chase two-reelers and writing gags for the Our Gang series, and he soon was supervising a hundred comedy shorts a year for Hal Roach Studios as vice president of production. His most-noted accomplishment during his tenure with Roach was his inspired notion that Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy—two of the studio’s top comic talents—should be made a permanent comedy team. McCarey then oversaw every aspect of the movies they made over the next four years, from the writing of the stories to the editing and previewing of the finished films. The 19 films that Laurel and Hardy made under McCarey’s supervision, including three that he directed, were essential in forming McCarey’s comic sensibilities.
