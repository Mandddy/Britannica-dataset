Black bass, any of about six species of elongated freshwater fishes that constitute the genus Micropterus of the sunfish family, Centrarchidae (order Perciformes). Black basses are found in eastern North America. Two of them, the largemouth and smallmouth basses (M. salmoides and M. dolomieu), have been introduced in other countries and are prized as hard-fighting game fishes.
The black basses, like the sunfishes, have the spiny and soft-rayed portions of the dorsal fin joined as a single fin. They are, however, larger and longer-bodied than the sunfishes, duller in colour, and more predatory in habit.
