Helmand River, also spelled Helmund, or Hilmand, Persian Daryā-ye Helmand, Latin Erymandrus,  river in southwestern Afghanistan and eastern Iran, about 715 miles (1,150 km) long. Rising in the Bābā Range in east-central Afghanistan, it flows southwestward across more than half the length of Afghanistan before flowing northward for a short distance through Iranian territory and emptying into the Helmand (Sīstān) swamps on the Afghan-Iranian border. It receives several tributaries, including the Arghandāb and Tarnak, and drains more than 100,000 square miles (160,000 square km).
The Helmand is one of Afghanistan’s most important rivers and has been extensively developed under the Helmand Valley Authority. A reservoir has been built at Kajakī, 50 miles (80 km) above Gereshk, for irrigation and flood control, and just above the same town a dam diverts water to a canal. Below the reservoir much of the river’s length is tapped for irrigation, and a fertile, populous belt follows its course. A long-standing dispute between Afghanistan and Iran has centred on Iran’s claim to a portion of the Helmand’s waters.
