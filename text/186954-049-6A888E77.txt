Terpene, any of a class of hydrocarbons occurring widely in plants and animals and empirically regarded as built up from isoprene, a hydrocarbon consisting of five carbon atoms attached to eight hydrogen atoms (C5H8). The term is often extended to the terpenoids, which are oxygenated derivatives of these hydrocarbons.
Biological formation of the terpenes occurs by the combination of two molecules of acetic acid to give mevalonic acid (C6H12O4) and conversion of the latter to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which contains the five-carbon isoprene skeleton. Further transformations of the isopentenyl compound yield the true terpenes and the terpenoids.
