Dong, Wade-Giles romanization Tung, also called Dongjia or Dongren, (Wade-Giles) Tung-chia or Tung-jen,  an ethnic minority of China found in southeastern Guizhou province and in neighbouring Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi and Hunan province. According to most linguists the Dong speak a Kam-Sui language that is closely related to the Tai languages, and they call themselves Kam.
The Dong first appeared in China during the Song dynasty (ad 960â€“1279), moving southwest in a series of migrations, possibly forced by the advancing Mongols. Concentrated today in sparsely populated Guizhou, they share the area with the Buyei.
