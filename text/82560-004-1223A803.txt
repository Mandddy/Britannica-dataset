Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA of America), organization formed in the United States in 1916 at the instigation of Rodman Wanamaker, a Philadelphia businessman, with the stated purpose of promoting interest in professional golf, elevating the standards of the game, and advancing the welfare of its members. By the early 21st century the PGA of America (often conventionally shortened to “PGA”) had a membership of more than 25,000 playing and teaching professionals. Its annual PGA Championship is one of the world’s four major golf tournaments. In addition, it shares in the conduct of an international team match with Great Britain for the Ryder Cup and cosponsors an annual yearlong series of tournaments, called the PGA Tour, held throughout North America (but primarily in the United States). Other activities include maintenance of a PGA Hall of Fame and a training program for would-be touring professionals. The PGA headquarters are in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
Similar organizations exist in other countries (the PGA of Canada was founded in 1911). The women’s equivalent of the PGA is the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA), founded in 1950. It provides organized professional tournament golf for women and holds the LPGA Championship tournament.
