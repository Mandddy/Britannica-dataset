Sedative-hypnotic drug, chemical substance used to reduce tension and anxiety and induce calm (sedative effect) or to induce sleep (hypnotic effect). Most such drugs exert a quieting or calming effect at low doses and a sleep-inducing effect in larger doses. Sedative-hypnotic drugs tend to depress the central nervous system. Since these actions can be obtained with other drugs, such as opiates, the distinctive characteristic of sedative-hypnotics is their selective ability to achieve their effects without affecting mood or reducing sensitivity to pain.
For centuries alcohol and opium were the only drugs available that had sedative-hypnotic effects. The first substance introduced specifically as a sedative and as a hypnotic was a liquid solution of bromide salts, which came into use in the 1800s. Chloral hydrate, a derivative of ethyl alcohol, was introduced in 1869 as a synthetic sedative-hypnotic; it was used notoriously as “knock-out” drops. Paraldehyde was introduced into clinical medicine in the 1880s and was followed by the synthesis of barbital in 1903. Phenobarbital became available in 1912 and was followed, during the next 20 years, by a long series of other barbiturates. In the mid-20th century new types of sedative-hypnotic drugs were synthesized, chief among them the benzodiazepines (the so-called minor tranquilizers).
