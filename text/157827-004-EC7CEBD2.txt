Bill Maher, byname of William Maher, Jr.  (born January 20, 1956, New York, New York, U.S.) American comedian and talk-show host known for his acerbic political commentary.
Maher grew up in River Vale, New Jersey. As a boy, he idolized The Tonight Show host Johnny Carson but hid his aspiration to be a comedian until his junior year studying English at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, when he first tried his stand-up act in a New York City comedy club. After graduating (B.A., 1978), Maher became a regular in clubs throughout the country. He also made many appearances on The Tonight Show and came to the attention of Steve Allen, who cast him as his sidekick on the cable series Steve Allen’s Music Room. Beginning in 1983, Maher tried acting, appearing in several films and television shows. Maher’s career was jump-started by cohosting Indecision ’92—a program that provided irreverent coverage of the presidential election—for the cable network Comedy Central. His success led to the debut of his own show, Politically Incorrect, in 1993.
