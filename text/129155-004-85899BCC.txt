Kartēr, also spelled Kartir, or Karder   (flourished  3rd century ad, Iran) influential high priest of Zoroastrianism, whose aim was to purge Iran of all other religions, especially the eclectic Manichaeism founded by the 3rd-century Persian prophet Mani. What little is known of Kartēr comes from inscriptions on cliff faces, mostly dating from the reign of Shāpūr I (241–272). On more than 700 cliffs he proclaimed the fundamental doctrines of the religion of Zoroaster.
Beginning his career under King Ardashīr I (ruled 224–241), Kartēr restored the purity of the Mazdean religion (Zoroastrianism). Under Shāpūr I, he held the title of ehrpat (“master of learning”). Later, under another king, Hormizd, he was elevated to the rank of magaput, or chief, of the Magi of Hormizd, a title previously unknown to the Magi, the priestly caste of ancient Persia.
