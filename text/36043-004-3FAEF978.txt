Eugène-Marin Labiche,  (born May 5, 1815, Paris, France—died  Jan. 23, 1888, Paris) comic playwright who wrote many of the most popular and amusing light comedies of the 19th-century French stage.
Born into the bourgeois class that was to provide him with the social setting for most of his works, Labiche read for the bar and then briefly worked as a journalist before turning to writing fiction. In 1838 he published a novel, La Clef des champs (“The Key to the Fields”). Of his early plays, Monsieur de Coislin (1838), written in collaboration with Marc Michel, was his first great success. A long series of hilarious full-length and one-act plays followed. Written together with other authors, these works were presented mostly at the Palais-Royal, the home of light comedy. Typically, the plays are based on an improbable incident evolving into an imbroglio that brings out the folly and frailty of the characters. The best of his works include Le Chapeau de paille d’Italie (1851; The Italian Straw Hat), which inspired René Clair’s classic film of the same name (1927); Le Misanthrope et l’Auvergnat (1852); Le Voyage de M. Perrichon (1860; The Journey of Mr. Perrichon); and La Poudre aux yeux (1861; “The Bluff”).
