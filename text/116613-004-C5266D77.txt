Lyman Trumbull,  (born Oct. 12, 1813, Colchester, Conn., U.S.â€”died June 25, 1896, Chicago, Ill.) U.S. senator from Illinois whose independent views during the Civil War and Reconstruction eras caused him to switch from the Democratic Party to the Republican to the Liberal Republican and back to the Democratic Party in his long political career.
Trumbull grew up in Connecticut, and, after studying law and gaining admission to the bar, settled in Illinois. His career in public life began in 1840, when he was elected to the state legislature as a Democrat.
