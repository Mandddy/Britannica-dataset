Ilse Koch, née Ilse Köhler, byname Witch of Buchenwald, German Hexe von Buchenwald  (born September 22, 1906, Dresden, Germany—died September 2, 1967, Aichach, West Germany) German wife of a commandant (1937–41) of Buchenwald concentration camp, notorious for her perversion and cruelty.
On May 29, 1937, she married Karl Otto Koch, a colonel in the SS who was commander of the Sachsenhausen camp. In the summer of 1937 he was transferred to Buchenwald, then a new concentration camp near Weimar. There Koch acquired her reputation as a sadist and nymphomaniac, beating prisoners with her riding crop and forcing them to perform physically exhausting activities for her own amusement. Koch and her husband enjoyed a lavish lifestyle in an elegant house on Buchenwald’s grounds, and he had a large horseback-riding arena built especially for her. Although the inmates were forced into starvation, the Kochs had all the food and alcohol they wanted, and they are alleged to have held orgies at their house for their SS staff.
