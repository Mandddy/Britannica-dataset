Monitor, ironclad warship originally designed for use in shallow harbours and rivers to blockade the Confederate states in the American Civil War (1861–65).
Built by the engineer John Ericsson for the U.S. Navy, the original vessel of this type was named Monitor. Remarkably engineered, it contained over 40 inventions entitled to basic patents. Essential features of its design included its minimal exposure above the waterline (making it hard to hit) and its protection from enemy fire—five inches of armour plate in the hull and one inch in the deck. The need to aim the guns when the ship could not be manoeuvred, as in a harbour, led to the development of the revolving turret. Swivelled by steam power, the turret of Monitor contained two 11-inch (280-millimetre) cannons; its turret box was covered with 8 inches of armour.
