Gaia, European Space Agency (ESA) satellite designed to provide highly accurate position and velocity measurements for one billion stars. It was launched on December 19, 2013, by a Soyuz rocket from Kourou, French Guiana.
Gaia carries two telescopes, each with an aperture of 1.45 by 0.5 metres (4.76 by 1.6 feet), with an angle of 106.5° between their lines of sight. Gaia will slowly rotate, allowing it to scan the entire sky. Positions for the brightest stars will be measured to an accuracy of 0.000007 arc second, about 140 times more accurate than the positions measured by the previous ESA satellite Hipparcos. Gaia also carries a photometer to measure the brightness of astronomical objects and a spectrometer to measure the velocities of those objects. Gaia will be positioned near the second Lagrangian point (L2), a gravitational balance point between Earth and the Sun and 1.5 million km (0.9 million miles) opposite the Sun from Earth. The spacecraft will move in a controlled Lissajous pattern around L2 rather than “hovering” there. Its mission is scheduled to last five years.
