Jeff Gordon,  (born August 4, 1971, Vallejo, California, U.S.) American race-car driver who dominated the sport in the 1990s and early 2000s. His aggressive driving style and knack for publicity helped popularize stock-car racing in the United States.
As a child, Gordon raced BMX bicycles before being given a quarter-midget race car. He won the national quarter-midget championship at age eight and again two years later. He soon advanced to more-powerful go-karts and routinely beat boys nearly twice his age. When Gordon was 13, his family moved to Pittsboro, Indiana, so that he could drive a 650-hp sprint car in races that did not have a minimum-age requirement. By the time he was 18, Gordon had decided to take up stock-car racing, and during the next two years, he gained invaluable experience at a number of driving schools, including that run by the National Motorsports Press Associationâ€™s Hall of Fame race-car driver Buck Baker.
