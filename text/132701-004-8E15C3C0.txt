Gwen Stefani, in full Gwen Renée Stefani  (born October 3, 1969, Fullerton, California, U.S.) American singer and songwriter, who came to fame in the 1990s as the lead singer for the rock-ska band No Doubt before starting a solo career.
As teenagers in Orange county, California, Stefani and her brother Eric helped found No Doubt, which fused ska with new wave-style pop. The group’s breakthrough came with its third album, the chart-topping Tragic Kingdom (1995), which included the hit singles “Just a Girl,” “Spiderwebs,” and “Don’t Speak.” As the band’s popularity grew, the spotlight was very much on the stylish Stefani, who became almost instantly identifiable by her fire-engine red lips and platinum blonde hair and who branched out to collaborate on recordings with rapper Eve and techno artist Moby. No Doubt followed Tragic Kingdom with Return of Saturn (2000) and Rock Steady (2001), the latter of which featured the Grammy Award-winning songs “Hey Baby” and “Underneath It All.” In 2002 Stefani married Gavin Rossdale, the front man for the British alternative rock group Bush; in 2015 the couple announced that they were divorcing.
