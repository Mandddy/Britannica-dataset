Papal States, also called Republic of Saint Peter or Church States, Italian Stati Pontifici or Stati della Chiesa,  territories of central Italy over which the pope had sovereignty from 756 to 1870. Included were the modern Italian regions of Lazio (Latium), Umbria, and Marche and part of Emilia-Romagna, though the extent of the territory, along with the degree of papal control, varied over the centuries.
As early as the 4th century, the popes had acquired considerable property around Rome (called the Patrimony of St. Peter). From the 5th century, with the breakdown of Roman imperial authority in the West, the popes’ influence in central Italy increased as the people of the area relied on them for protection against barbarian invasions. Leo I (reigned 440–461), for example, prevented Attila the Hun from sacking Rome, and Gregory I (590–604) faced threats from the Lombards. Gregory reorganized the papacy’s vast estates and improved its administration of charity. Notwithstanding these early developments, the papacy and its territories remained part of the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) during this period.
