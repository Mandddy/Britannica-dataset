Cascade,  waterfall, especially a series of small falls, consisting of water descending over rocks or boulders. It may be natural or it may be artificial. The cascade has often been used as a feature of formal gardens.
A garden cascade properly employs a natural supply of water and a sloping site; but the site is usually adapted artificially to take advantage of the stream, and sometimes a cascade that strives to appear natural is dependent on a head of water artificially created by pumps.
