Jaguaribe River,  river, Ceará estado (“state”), northeastern Brazil. It is formed by the junction of the Carapateiro and Trici rivers (originating in the Serra Grande) and flows northeastward for approximately 350 miles (560 km) to enter the Atlantic Ocean east of Maceió Point. Upstream from Limoeiro do Norte the river branches, converging again about 30 miles (48 km) from its mouth. The Jaguaribe’s flow is erratic: long periods of drought during which much of the river is dry are followed by catastrophic floods in which the towns along its lower course are inundated. There is an irrigation dam at Orós. Drought-resistant carnauba palms, which supply wax, cellulose, and thatch for roofs, grow abundantly along the river’s banks and have been used by the Brazilian government in reforestation programs in the northeast.
