Alberto Giacometti,  (born October 10, 1901, Borgonovo, Switzerland—died January 11, 1966, Chur) Swiss sculptor and painter, best known for his attenuated sculptures of solitary figures. His work has been compared to that of the existentialists in literature.
Giacometti displayed precocious talent and was much encouraged by his father, Giovanni, a Post-Impressionist painter, and by his godfather, Cuno Amiet, a Fauvist painter. He spent a happy childhood in the village of Stampa, to which he returned regularly until his death. He grew up among brothers who also showed a penchant for the arts. His brother Diego became known as a furniture designer and served as Giacometti’s model and aide. Another brother, Bruno, became an architect.
