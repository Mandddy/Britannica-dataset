Domino, small, flat, rectangular block used as gaming object. Dominoes are made of rigid material such as wood, bone, or plastic and are variously referred to as bones, pieces, men, stones, or cards.
Like playing cards, of which they are a variant, dominoes bear identifying marks on one side and are blank or identically patterned on the other side. The identity-bearing face of each piece is divided, by a line or ridge, into two squares, each of which is marked with an arrangement of spots, or “pips,” like those used on a die, except that some squares are blank (indicated in the listing below by a zero). The usual Western set consists of 28 pieces, marked respectively 6-6 (“double six”), 6-5, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, 6-0, 5-5, 5-4, 5-3, 5-2, 5-1, 5-0, 4-4, 4-3, 4-2, 4-1, 4-0, 3-3, 3-2, 3-1, 3-0, 2-2, 2-1, 2-0, 1-1, 1-0, 0-0. Larger sets running up to 9-9 (58 pieces) and even 12-12 (91 pieces) are sometimes used. The Inuit of North America play a domino-like game using sets consisting of as many as 148 pieces.
