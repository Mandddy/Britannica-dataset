English setter, breed of sporting dog that has served as a gun dog in England for more than 400 years and has been bred in its present form since about 1825. It is sometimes called the Llewellin setter or the Laverack setter for the developers of two strains of the breed. Like the other setters, it locates birds for the hunter. Characteristically rugged yet aristocratic in appearance, it stands 24 to 25 inches (61 to 63.5 cm) and weighs 40 to 70 pounds (18 to 32 kg). The working strain of the breed tends to be smaller than dogs bred for show. It has a long head, hanging ears, a deep chest, and a pointed tail. Its coat develops long feathering on the ears, chest, legs, and tail and may be white flecked with tan (called orange belton) or with black (blue belton) or tricolour (blue belton with tan on muzzle, over the eyes, and on the legs); lemon or liver belton coloration is less common. A valued hunter and companion dog, the English setter is a people-oriented and friendly breed with a mellow disposition.
