Pilea,  genus of herbaceous creeping plants in the nettle family (Urticaceae) but lacking the stinging hairs typical of that family. Of the more than 200 species widespread in temperate and tropical regions, a few are useful as border-edging plants in warm areas and many varieties are available as indoor pot plants and for hanging baskets.
Especially popular are the artillery plant (P. microphylla), with fine fernlike foliage and anthers that forcefully expel their pollen when mature; aluminum plant, or watermelon pilea (P. cadierei), with silvery markings on glossy dark green leaves; and friendship plant, or panamiga (P. involucrata), with quilted bronzy leaves.
