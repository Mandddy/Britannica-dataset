Cape Lookout National Seashore, scenic coastal area on the barrier islands of the southern Outer Banks, eastern North Carolina, U.S. The national seashore, created in 1966, has an area of 44 square miles (114 square km). The three islands—North Core Banks, South Core Banks, and Shackleford Banks—that make up the park extend 55 miles (90 km) from Ocracoke Inlet in the north to Beaufort Inlet in the southwest, fronting the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Pamlico and Core sounds to the west. These low, narrow barrier islands consist of beaches, low dunes, and flat grasslands along the Atlantic with salt marshes along Pamlico and Core sounds. Shackleford Banks has some maritime forests. Among the various beach grasses the sea oats, protected by law, have deep roots that anchor the sand. The islands are also a haven for the threatened loggerhead sea turtle and for many species of aquatic birds.
Access to the national seashore is by ferry or private boat only. Portsmouth Village, chartered in 1753 and now a restored village on the National Register of Historic Places, lies on the northern tip of North Core Banks. A lighthouse at Cape Lookout on the southern tip of South Core Banks dates to 1859 and is still operational. The islands were used for fishing and whaling for centuries, and the surrounding waters have long been known for their dangerous shoals. Just to the north is Ocracoke Island, which is part of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Fort Macon State Park lies just to the west across Beaufort Inlet on the northeastern tip of Bogue Banks.
