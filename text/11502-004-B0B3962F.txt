J. Willard Gibbs, in full Josiah Willard Gibbs  (born February 11, 1839, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.—died April 28, 1903, New Haven) theoretical physicist and chemist who was one of the greatest scientists in the United States in the 19th century. His application of thermodynamic theory converted a large part of physical chemistry from an empirical into a deductive science.
Gibbs was the fourth child and only son of Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr., professor of sacred literature at Yale University. There were college presidents among his ancestors and scientific ability in his mother’s family. Facially and mentally, Gibbs resembled his mother. He was a friendly youth but was also withdrawn and intellectually absorbed. This circumstance and his delicate health kept him from participating much in student and social life. He was educated at the local Hopkins Grammar School and in 1854 entered Yale, where he won a succession of prizes. After graduating, Gibbs pursued research in engineering. His thesis on the design of gearing was distinguished by the logical rigour with which he employed geometrical methods of analysis. In 1863 Gibbs received the first doctorate of engineering to be conferred in the United States. He was appointed a tutor at Yale in the same year. He devoted some attention to engineering invention.
