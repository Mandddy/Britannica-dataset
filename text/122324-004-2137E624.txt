John Rolfe,  (baptized May 6, 1585, Norfolk, Englandâ€”died 1622?, Virginia [U.S.]) Virginia planter and colonial official who was the husband of Pocahontas, daughter of the Indian chief Powhatan.
John Rolfe sailed for Virginia in 1609, but a shipwreck in the Bermudas delayed his arrival until the following year. About 1612 he began to experiment with growing tobacco. When he found that the local variety was too bitter for English tastes, he began cultivating seeds that he brought from the West Indies. In June 1613 Rolfe sent some of the West Indian tobacco to England. Its widespread acceptance there provided needed economic stability for Virginia.
