Arthur B. Davies, in full Arthur Bowen Davies   (born Sept. 26, 1862, Utica, N.Y., U.S.—died  Oct. 24, 1928, Florence, Italy) American painter, printmaker, and tapestry designer known for his idylls of classical fantasy painted in a Romantic style but best remembered for his leadership in introducing modern European painting styles into early 20th-century America.
Trained in Utica, New York City, and Chicago, Davies at first painted atmospheric landscapes in the Romantic manner—e.g., “Along the Erie Canal” (1890; Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.). It was after 1900 that his most characteristic works were created—idyllic scenes of elegant nude figures and mythological creatures gracefully grouped in frieze compositions before stark Romantic landscapes—e.g., “Crescendo” (1910; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City).
