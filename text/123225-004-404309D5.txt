Cornbread,  any of various breads made wholly or in part of cornmeal, corn (maize) ground to the consistency of fine granules. Cornbread is especially associated with the cuisine of the Southern and Atlantic U.S. states. Because corn lacks elastic gluten, it cannot be raised with yeast; consequently, most cornbreads are leavened with baking powder or baked unleavened, even when made partly of wheat flour. Cornbreads tend to be crumbly in texture and do not keep well.
There are numerous regional variations of cornbread. The simplest are hoecakes, a mixture of cornmeal, water, and salt, so named because they were originally baked on the flat of a hoe over a wood fire. Johnnycakes and corn pone are somewhat thicker cakes that may have added ingredients such as fat or wheat flour. Spoonbread, a misnomer, actually denotes a cornmeal pudding. The usual Southern cornbread is made from a batter containing cornmeal, wheat flour, eggs, milk or buttermilk, and shortening; the addition of sugar is generally considered inauthentic. Hush puppies are small cakes of cornbread batter, often with chopped onions, fried in deep fat, and customarily served as an accompaniment to fried fish.
