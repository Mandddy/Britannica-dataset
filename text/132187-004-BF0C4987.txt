Franz, baron von Mercy,  (baron of), Mercy also spelled Merci   (born c. 1590, Longwy, Duchy of Bar—died  Aug. 3, 1645, Alerheim, Swabia) Austrian and Bavarian field marshal during the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), whose defense of Bavaria made him one of the most successful imperial commanders of his time.
Mercy entered the Austrian army around 1606. Wounded in the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631), he made his name in the five-month defense of Rheinfelden (1634) against the formidable Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. After campaigning in Alsace (1635–37) and the Franche-Comté, he entered the service of the elector Maximilian I of Bavaria (1638). An able strategist, he frustrated French invasion plans of Bavaria in 1643 and defeated the French at Tuttlingen in November of that year. In 1644 he saw action against the Duc d’Enghien (later the Great Condé) and the marshal Henri de Turenne. On July 27, 1644, Mercy took Freiburg im Breisgau, relieved by the French in August, and at the Battle of Mergentheim (May 1645) Turenne suffered his “first and only” defeat at the hands of the imperial commander. As in 1643, Mercy consistently outmanoeuvred his enemies and gave battle only on the terms most favourable to himself. He was finally caught by the combined armies of d’Enghien and Turenne at Alerheim in the second Battle of Nördlingen and killed at the head of his men. In recognition of his skill and bravery, d’Enghien set the inscription of his death, Sta viator, heroem calcas (“Halt, traveller, you are treading on a hero”), on the spot where Mercy fell.
