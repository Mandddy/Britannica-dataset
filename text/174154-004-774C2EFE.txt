Arnold Bennett, in full Enoch Arnold Bennett  (born May 27, 1867, Hanley, Staffordshire, England—died March 27, 1931, London) British novelist, playwright, critic, and essayist whose major works form an important link between the English novel and the mainstream of European realism.
Bennett’s father was a self-made man who had managed to qualify as a solicitor: the family atmosphere was one of sturdy respectability and self-improvement. Arnold, the eldest of nine children, was educated at the Middle School, Newcastle-under-Lyme; he then entered his father’s office as a clerk. In 1889 he moved to London, still as a solicitor’s clerk, but soon gained a footing in literature by writing popular serial fiction and editing a women’s magazine. After the publication of his first novel, A Man from the North (1898), he became a professional writer, living first in the Bedfordshire countryside, then, following his father’s death, moving to Paris in 1903. In 1907 he married a French actress, Marguerite Soulié; they separated in 1921.
