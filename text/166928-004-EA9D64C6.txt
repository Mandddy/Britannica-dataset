Wright flyer of 1905,  third powered airplane designed, built, and flown by Wilbur and Orville Wright. It represented the final step in their quest for a practical airplane capable of staying aloft for extended periods of time under the complete control of the pilot.
The flyer took to the air for the first time on June 23, 1905, at Huffman Prairie, a pasture located on the streetcar line some 8 miles (13 km) east of Dayton, Ohio. It was designed along the lines of the Wrights’ first flyer of 1903 and a second model of 1904, but it also incorporated several important improvements. First, it was powered by the same four-cylinder engine that had propelled the 1904 flyer, but constant operation had smoothed the pistons and cylinder walls, so that by the end of the 1905 flying season the engine was generating 20–22 horsepower (compared with 15–16 horsepower the year before). An improved propeller design further increased the efficiency of the 1905 propulsion system. In order to correct a tendency on the part of the airplane to pitch dangerously in flight, the Wrights increased the distance between the leading edge of the wing and the stabilizer, a pair of horizontal surfaces located to the front of the craft. As in the first Wright flyer, the pilot lay prone on the lower wing, but in the 1905 machine he was given direct control of the vertical rudder at the rear of the craft by means of a hand lever.
