Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey,  (born 1517, Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, Eng.?—died  Jan. 13, 1547, London) poet who, with Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503–42), introduced into England the styles and metres of the Italian humanist poets and so laid the foundation of a great age of English poetry.
The eldest son of Lord Thomas Howard, Henry took the courtesy title of Earl of Surrey in 1524 when his father succeeded as 3rd Duke of Norfolk. It was Surrey’s fate, because of his birth and connections, to be involved (though usually peripherally) in the jockeying for place that accompanied Henry VIII’s policies. From 1530 until 1532 he lived at Windsor with his father’s ward, Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond, who was the son of Henry VIII and his mistress Elizabeth Blount. In 1532, after talk of marriage with the princess Mary (daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon), he married Lady Frances de Vere, the 14-year-old daughter of the Earl of Oxford, but they did not live together until 1535. Despite this marriage, an alliance between him and the princess Mary was still discussed. In 1533 Richmond married Surrey’s sister Mary, but the two did not live together because Mary preferred to stay in the country. Richmond died three years later, under suspicious circumstances.
