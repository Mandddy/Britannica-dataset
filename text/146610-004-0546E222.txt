Canadian National Railway Company (CN), corporation created by the Canadian government in 1918 to operate a number of nationalized railroads (including the old Grand Trunk lines, the Intercolonial Railway, the National Transcontinental Railway, and the Canadian Northern Railway) as one of Canada’s two transcontinental railroad systems. Headquarters are in Montreal.
In its early years Canadian National engaged in a fierce competitive struggle with the privately owned Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. This ended with the Canadian National–Canadian Pacific Act in 1933, which directed the railways to cooperate by eliminating duplication of services. In 1978 Canadian National’s passenger services were taken over by VIA Rail Canada, a crown corporation set up to operate all Canadian passenger services except commuter services. In 1995, in what was at the time the largest privatization in Canadian history, the government sold off its stock in CN. Four years later the railroad acquired all the stock of the Illinois Central Railroad, thereby forming a rail network that reached from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Canada. In 1998 an alliance with Kansas City Southern Railway extended CN’s lines into Mexico, furthering CN’s goal of becoming “the NAFTA railroad,” establishing itself as an important carrier of freight between Canada, the United States, and Mexico under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
