James P. Johnson, in full James Price Johnson   (born Feb. 1, 1894, New Brunswick, N.J., U.S.—died  Nov. 17, 1955, New York, N.Y.) highly influential black American jazz pianist who also wrote popular songs and composed classical works. A founder of the stride piano idiom, he was a crucial figure in the transition from ragtime to jazz.
In his youth Johnson studied classical and ragtime piano techniques, and by his late teens he was performing in saloons, in dance halls, and at parties in a black community on Manhattan’s West Side, near Hell’s Kitchen. While playing for dancers before 1920 he became noted for his rare ability to create embellishments, variations, and improvisations on popular songs, including the blues, relatively new at the time. He made piano rolls followed by recordings of his own songs. He also composed and orchestrated music for stage revues, including Keep Shufflin’, a 1928 collaboration with his leading student, Fats Waller.
