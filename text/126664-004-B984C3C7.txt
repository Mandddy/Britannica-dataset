Paul Newman, in full Paul Leonard Newman  (born January 26, 1925, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—died September 26, 2008, Westport, Connecticut) American actor and director whose striking good looks, intelligence, and charisma became hallmarks in a film career that spanned more than 50 years, during which time he became known for his compelling performances of iconic antiheroes. He was also active in a number of philanthropic endeavours.
Newman grew up in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He attended Ohio University—from which he was reportedly expelled—before serving as a navy radio operator during World War II. Upon his discharge, he enrolled at Ohio’s Kenyon College (B.A., 1949), where he acted in a number of plays. After graduation he appeared in stock productions, but he returned home following the death of his father in 1950. Newman ran the family’s sporting-goods store for one year before enrolling in Yale University’s drama department. He left the program in 1952 and moved to New York City, where he studied at The Actors Studio, which he credited for his later acting success.
