Atlantic salmon,  (species Salmo salar), oceanic trout of the family Salmonidae, a highly prized game fish. It averages about 5.5 kg (12 pounds) and is marked with round or cross-shaped spots. Found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, it enters streams in the fall to spawn. After spawning, adults are called kelts and may live to spawn again. The young enter the sea in about two years and mature in about four.
The ouananiche (Salmo salar ouananiche) of rivers and the sebago, or lake, salmon (S. salar sebago) are smaller, landlocked forms of Atlantic salmon, also prized for sport. The Atlantic salmon has also been successfully introduced into the Great Lakes of the United States. (See also salmon.)
