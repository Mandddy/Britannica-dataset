Cleveland, city, seat (1810) of Cuyahoga county, northeastern Ohio, U.S. It is a major St. Lawrence Seaway port on the southern shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. Greater Cleveland sprawls along the lake for about 100 miles (160 km) and runs more than 40 miles (65 km) inland, encompassing Cuyahoga, Lake, Geauga, and Medina counties and more than 70 suburban communities, including Lakewood, Parma, Shaker Heights, Cleveland Heights, East Cleveland, Euclid, Garfield Heights, and Rocky River.
Most of the city lies on a plain that rises 60 to 80 feet (18 to 25 metres) above the lake and is divided by the narrow valley of the Cuyahoga, locally known as the Flats. Lake Erie moderates the cityâ€™s climate, keeping temperatures generally cooler in summer and warmer in winter and occasionally causing heavy "lake effect" winter snows. Inc. city, 1836.
