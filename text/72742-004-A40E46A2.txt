Out of the Past, American film noir, released in 1947, that is widely recognized as a quintessential example of the genre.
Jeff Bailey (played by Robert Mitchum) appears to be an ordinary gas station attendant in a small California town. When he is called to a meeting with the slick gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), however, Bailey is forced to reveal to his girlfriend (Virginia Huston) that his real name is Jeff Markham and that he is, in fact, a private detective. In an extended flashback, Jeff retraces his history with Whit, who years earlier had hired him to track down Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer). According to Whit, Kathie had been his girlfriend but had shot him and taken off for Mexico with $40,000 of his money. Upon locating her in Acapulco, Jeff found himself immediately enchanted by the seductive baby-faced Kathie—a classic femme fatale—and soon ran off with her to San Francisco. When Jeff’s disgruntled business partner (Steve Brodie) eventually found the couple and attempted to blackmail them, though, Kathie fatally shot him and then disappeared.
