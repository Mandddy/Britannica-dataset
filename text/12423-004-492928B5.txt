Sir George Darwin, in full Sir George Howard Darwin  (born July 9, 1845, Downe, Kent, England—died December 7, 1912, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) English astronomer who championed the theory that the Moon was once part of the Earth, until it was pulled free to form a satellite.
The second son of the eminent naturalist Charles Darwin, he became Plumian professor of astronomy and experimental philosophy at Cambridge University in 1883. His monumental analysis of tides, published in 1884, was based on the methods developed by Pierre-Simon Laplace and Lord Kelvin. In The Tides and Kindred Phenomena in the Solar System (1898), he discussed the effects of tidal friction on the Earth–Moon system and theorized that the Moon was formed from matter pulled away from the still-molten Earth by solar tides, a hypothesis now considered unlikely to be true. His great achievement was that he was the first to develop a theory of evolution for the Sun–Earth–Moon system based on mathematical analysis in geophysical theory.
