Friedrich Ludwig, prince zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen,  (born Jan. 31, 1746, Ingelfingen, Württemberg—died  Feb. 15, 1818, Castle Slawenitz, Silesia) Prussian field marshal who commanded one of the two Prussian armies that were decisively defeated by Napoleon at the twin battles of Jena and Auerstädt in 1806, a disaster that turned his country into a French dependency.
Hohenlohe entered the Prussian Army in 1768, distinguishing himself in the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79). He became governor of Berlin in 1791 and participated in the campaign on the Rhine against revolutionary France in 1794. After war broke out again in 1806, he was given command of one of the two Prussian armies facing Napoleon. Disagreements with the commander in chief, Charles William Ferdinand, duke of Brunswick, caused a disastrous lack of coordination between the two armies. Napoleon practically destroyed Hohenlohe’s force at Jena on Oct. 14, 1806. Retreating to Prenzlau, the Prince surrendered the remainder of his army two weeks later. He spent two years in French captivity, after which he retired in 1809.
