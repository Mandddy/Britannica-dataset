Coronal mass ejection (CME), large eruption of magnetized plasma from the Sun’s outer atmosphere, or corona, that propagates outward into interplanetary space. The CME is one of the main transient features of the Sun. Although it is known to be formed by explosive reconfigurations of solar magnetic fields through the process of magnetic reconnection, its exact formation mechanism is not yet understood.
Fast CMEs drive interplanetary shocks in the solar wind and cause the most intense geomagnetic storms on Earth. The main drivers of space weather, geomagnetic storms are disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere that can have significant impact on both ground- and space-based technological systems. Their formation process, three-dimensional structure, evolution as they propagate through interplanetary space, relationship with solar flares, and impact on Earth’s space environment are important areas of solar and space physics research.
