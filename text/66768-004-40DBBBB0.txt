Robert Bly, in full Robert Elwood Bly  (born December 23, 1926, Madison, Minnesota, U.S.) American poet, translator, editor, and author, perhaps best known to the public at large as the author of Iron John: A Book About Men (1990, reprinted 2001 as Iron John: Men and Masculinity). Drawing upon Jungian psychology, myth, legend, folklore, and fairy tales (the title is taken from a story by the Brothers Grimm), the book demonstrates Bly’s masculinist convictions. Though it had many detractors, it proved an important, creative, and best-selling work on the subject of manhood and masculinity for a budding men’s movement in the United States.
After serving in the U.S. Navy, Bly studied at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota (1946–47), Harvard University (B.A., 1950), and the University of Iowa (M.A., 1956). In 1958 he cofounded the magazine The Fifties (its name changed with the decades), which published translations and poetry by Bly and other important young poets. Bly’s first collection of poems, Silence in the Snowy Fields (1962), reveals his sense of man in nature. It was followed by The Light Around the Body (1968), which won a National Book Award.
