Photoelectric effect, phenomenon in which electrically charged particles are released from or within a material when it absorbs electromagnetic radiation. The effect is often defined as the ejection of electrons from a metal plate when light falls on it. In a broader definition, the radiant energy may be infrared, visible, or ultraviolet light, X rays, or gamma rays; the material may be a solid, liquid, or gas; and the released particles may be ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) as well as electrons. The phenomenon was fundamentally significant in the development of modern physics because of the puzzling questions it raised about the nature of light—particle versus wavelike behaviour—that were finally resolved by Albert Einstein in 1905. The effect remains important for research in areas from materials science to astrophysics, as well as forming the basis for a variety of useful devices.
The photoelectric effect was discovered in 1887 by the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. In connection with work on radio waves, Hertz observed that, when ultraviolet light shines on two metal electrodes with a voltage applied across them, the light changes the voltage at which sparking takes place. This relation between light and electricity (hence photoelectric) was clarified in 1902 by another German physicist, Philipp Lenard. He demonstrated that electrically charged particles are liberated from a metal surface when it is illuminated and that these particles are identical to electrons, which had been discovered by the British physicist Joseph John Thomson in 1897.
