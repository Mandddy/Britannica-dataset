Alexander Natalis, French Alexandre Noël   (born January 19, 1639, Rouen, France—died August 21, 1724, Paris) controversial theologian and ecclesiastical historian who clashed with Rome for expressing Gallicanism, a French position advocating restriction of papal power, and for defending Jansenism, a religious movement of nonorthodox tendencies in France.
Natalis joined the Dominicans at Rouen (1655), received a doctorate in divinity from the Sorbonne (1675), and was regent of studies at Saint-Jacques, Paris. Natalis’s chief work, Selecta historiae ecclesiasticae capita, 24 vol. (1676–86; “Selected Chapters of Ecclesiastical History”), was condemned by Pope Innocent XI in 1684 because of its defense of Gallican claims. Natalis issued a revised edition, Historia ecclesiastica veteris et novi testamenti (“Ecclesiastical History of the Old and New Testaments”), in eight volumes in 1699, but it was not until 1734 that the edition was removed from the Index of Forbidden Books.
