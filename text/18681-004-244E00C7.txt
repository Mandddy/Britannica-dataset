Erie, county, extreme western New York state, U.S., bounded to the south by Cattaraugus Creek, to the west by Lake Erie, to the northwest by the Niagara River, and to the north by Tonawanda Creek, which is incorporated into the New York State Canal System and its constituent the Erie Canal. The county includes Grand Island on the Niagara River. The terrain rises from lowlands near Lake Erie to rolling hills in the east. Some other streams are Ellicott, Cayuga, Buffalo, and Eighteenmile creeks. Forests consist of a mix of hardwoods. Public lands include Evangola, Beaver Island, and Buckhorn Island state parks and Cattaraugus Indian Reservation.
Among the Iroquoian-speaking Indian tribes in the region were Erie and Seneca. Buffalo, the county seat, is the state’s second largest city and one of the nation’s leading rail centres. Connected to Ontario, Canada, by bridge, it developed as the western terminus of the Erie Canal (completed 1825) and as a major port of the Saint Lawrence Seaway (1959). Buffalo was the home of U.S. Presidents Millard Fillmore and Grover Cleveland; Cleveland once served as the mayor (1881–82). In September 1901 Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as the 26th president of the United States at the historic Wilcox Mansion after President William McKinley was assassinated at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo.
