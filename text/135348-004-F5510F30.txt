Beard, hair grown upon a manâ€™s chin and cheeks. Frequently a badge of full manhood, it has been held in high honour in various periods of history. The wearing of a beard is a matter of religious observance for men of many faiths, such as some Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians.
The first man, the deity, prophets of many faiths, kings, nobles, and dignitaries are traditionally depicted with beards. Down through the ages beards have taken all shapes and lengths. The ancients were bearded: Egyptians frizzed, dyed or hennaed, and sometimes braided their beards; the beard of the Greek was full enough to curl and be curled, while that of the Roman was trimmed. The razor was used in Rome in the 6th century bce; however, shaving did not become general until about the mid-5th century bce. Anglo-Saxon men generally wore beards until the coming of Christianity in the 7th century, when the clergy were required by law to shave.
