Muḥammad Tawfīq Pasha, also spelled Mohammed Tewfik Pasha, in full Muḥammad Tawfīq Pasha ibn Ismāʿīl ibn Ibrāhīm ibn Muḥammad ʿAlī  (born April 30, 1852, Cairo, Egypt—died  Jan. 7, 1892, Ḥulwān) khedive of Egypt (1879–92) during the first phase of the British occupation.
The eldest son of Khedive Ismāʿīl, Tawfīq was distinguished from other members of his family by having engaged in study in Egypt rather than in Europe. He subsequently assumed a variety of administrative positions, including the head of the Privy Council and president of the Council of Ministers. The Ottoman sultan appointed Tawfīq khedive in 1879, when Ismāʿīl proved obstructive to the interests of the European powers.
