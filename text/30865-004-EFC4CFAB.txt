Angel and demon, demon also spelled daemon,  respectively, any benevolent or malevolent spiritual being that mediates between the transcendent and temporal realms.
Throughout the history of religions, varying kinds and degrees of beliefs have existed in various spiritual beings, powers, and principles that mediate between the realm of the sacred or holy—i.e., the transcendent realm—and the profane realm of time, space, and cause and effect. Such spiritual beings when regarded as benevolent are usually called angels in Western religions; those viewed as malevolent are termed demons. In other religions—Eastern, ancient, and those of nonliterate cultures—such intermediate beings are less categorical, for they may be benevolent in some circumstances and malevolent in others.
