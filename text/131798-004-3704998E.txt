Jacques Boucher de Perthes, in full Jacques Boucher de Crèvecoeur de Perthes   (born Sept. 10, 1788, Rethel, France—died  Aug. 5, 1868, Abbeville) French archaeologist and writer who was one of the first to develop the idea that prehistory could be measured on the basis of periods of geologic time.
From 1825 Boucher de Perthes was director of the customhouse at Abbeville, near the mouth of the Somme River, and began devoting his leisure to archaeological searches in the Somme valley. In 1837 he discovered flint hand axes and other stone tools, some embedded with the bones of extinct mammals in gravels deposited during the Pleistocene Epoch, or Ice Age (concluded about 11,700 years ago).
