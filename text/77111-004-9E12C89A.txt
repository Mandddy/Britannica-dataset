Ronald Colman, in full Ronald Charles Colman  (born February 9, 1891, Richmond, Surrey, England—died May 19, 1958, Santa Barbara, California, U.S.) Hollywood film actor whose screen image embodied the archetypal English gentleman. His elegant accent and polished demeanour gave voice to characters who were sophisticated yet graciously heroic, which contrasted with the rugged, action-oriented screen images of American-bred leading men.
Though Colman showed an interest in acting at an early age, his financial responsibilities to his family prevented him from pursuing the stage as a career. During World War I he joined the London Scottish Regionals regiment; he was decorated and discharged for wounds suffered at Messines, Belgium. Free from family obligations, he pursued his interest in acting and received his first break in 1916 when Gladys Cooper selected him to play opposite her in The Misleading Lady. The following year he made his first film, a two-reel comedy called The Live Wire, though the shy, inexperienced actor was anything but what the title suggests, prompting one executive to remark, “He doesn’t screen well.”
