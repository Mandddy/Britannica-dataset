Wave-particle duality, possession by physical entities (such as light and electrons) of both wavelike and particle-like characteristics. On the basis of experimental evidence, German physicist Albert Einstein first showed (1905) that light, which had been considered a form of electromagnetic waves, must also be thought of as particle-like, localized in packets of discrete energy. The observations of the Compton effect (1922) by American physicist Arthur Holly Compton could only be explained if light had a wave-particle duality. French physicist Louis de Broglie proposed (1924) that electrons and other discrete bits of matter, which until then had been conceived only as material particles, also have wave properties such as wavelength and frequency. Later (1927) the wave nature of electrons was experimentally established by American physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer. An understanding of the complementary relation between the wave aspects and the particle aspects of the same phenomenon was announced by Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1928 (see complementarity principle).
