Scarface: The Shame of a Nation, American gangster film, released in 1932, that is loosely based on the rise of Al Capone. It was an early success for both director Howard Hawks and actor Paul Muni.
The film traces the life and crimes of an ambitious gangster, Tony Camonte (played by Muni), as he systematically assassinates his enemies in order to rise to the top of Chicago’s gangland hierarchy. The film opens with his slaying of the “last of the old-fashioned gang leaders,” marking the ascent of a dangerous and greedy new breed of criminals. Though Camonte manages to become very rich, his avarice leads to his downfall. The character’s relationship with his headstrong younger sister (Ann Dvorak) was unusual for films of the time, as it displayed strongly incestuous undertones.
