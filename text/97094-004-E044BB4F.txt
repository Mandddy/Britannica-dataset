Hajdú-Bihar, megye (county), eastern Hungary. It is bordered by the county of Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg to the north, by Romania to the east, and by the counties of Békés to the south, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok to the southwest, and Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén to the northwest. Debrecen is the county seat. Major towns also include Balmazújváros, Hajdúböszörmény, Hajdúszoboszló, and Püspökladány.
The county occupies a large area of the Transtisza (Tiszántúl), a part of the Great Alfold (Great Hungarian Plain, or Nagy Magyar Alföld) east of the Tisza River. The land consists mainly of sandy soils; most of the natural vegetation has been depleted. Summers are hot and winters very cold. In the 19th century the Tisza was regulated through the construction of the Tiszalök Dam and the 60-mile (100-km) Main Canal, which supplies water to the Hortobágy steppe and the Hajdúság, a low tableland covered by fertile black soil. Rice, wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, sunflowers, and lentils all flourish in the county wherever recurring drought has been eliminated by irrigation projects. Natural gas is exploited at Hajdúszoboszló, Nádudvar, and Berekböszörmény. There are pebble mines in Ártánd and clay mines in the Hajdúság. Although Hajdú-Bihar as a whole is one of the less-industrialized areas of the country, Debrecen’s industrial production is significant and includes chemicals, food, textiles, and manufacturing.
