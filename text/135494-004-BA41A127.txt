Martin Beck,  (born July 30, 1867, Liptószentmiklós, Hung. [now Liptovský Mikuláš, Slvk.]—died  Nov. 16, 1940, New York, N.Y., U.S.) Hungarian-born American theatre manager, owner, and impresario, who managed (1903–23) the dominant vaudeville circuit between Chicago and California.
Educated in Vienna, Beck immigrated to the United States with a group of German actors. Stranded in Chicago about 1890, when his vaudeville troupe disbanded, he soon became the successful manager of the Orpheum Concert Saloon, out of which grew the Orpheum Vaudeville Circuit (established 1903). Beck extended the circuit to more than 60 theatres and built the most famous vaudeville theatre in the nation, the Palace, in Times Square, New York City. He introduced to the United States entertainments as diverse as the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company and the magic of Harry Houdini. Noted throughout his career for an unmatched ability to select successful sites, Beck built a theatre, named the Martin Beck, some distance from the central theatrical thoroughfare of Broadway. It prospered in spite of its unorthodox location and the opposition of the United Bookings Office, which had a monopoly on vaudeville talent in the eastern United States.
