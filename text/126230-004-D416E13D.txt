It is also one of the Sun’s closer neighbours, at a distance of about 25 light-years. Vega’s spectral type is A (white) and its luminosity class V (main sequence). It will become the northern polestar by about ad 14,000 because of the precession of the equinoxes. Vega is surrounded by a disk of circumstellar dust that may be similar to the solar system’s Kuiper Belt.
