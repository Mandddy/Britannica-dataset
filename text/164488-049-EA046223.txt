Sol LeWitt,  (born September 9, 1928, Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.â€”died April 8, 2007, New York, New York) American artist whose work provides a link between Minimalism and conceptual art.
LeWitt was the son of Russian immigrants. He attended Syracuse University (B.F.A., 1949) and, following military service in Japan and Korea, moved in 1953 to New York City. There he worked as a graphic designer for the architect I.M. Pei in 1955 and 1956. Following a brief period of working in an Abstract Expressionist style in the 1950s, LeWitt in the early 1960s began to pursue an essentialist approach to art that was less emotional yet still rich in complexity. He started to work serially, concentrating on sculptures of various gridlike axial arrangements of modular white aluminum, wood, or metal cubes.
