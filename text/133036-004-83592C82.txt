Airbus Industrie, European aircraft-manufacturing consortium formed in 1970 to fill a market niche for short- to medium-range, high-capacity jetliners. It is now one of the world’s top two commercial aircraft manufacturers, competing directly with the American Boeing Company and frequently dominating the jetliner market in orders, deliveries, or annual revenue. Full members include the German-French-Spanish-owned European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), with an 80 percent interest, and Britain’s BAE Systems, with 20 percent. Belgium’s Belairbus and Italy’s Alenia are risk-sharing associate members in selected programs. Headquarters are near Toulouse, France.
Airbus Industrie employs more than 50,000 people. Employees work directly on Airbus aircraft in France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom, and China, and others are employed in engineering, sales, training, and other occupations around the world. The consortium has more than 1,500 suppliers and holds cooperative agreements with numerous companies in many countries. American companies are responsible for about a third of Airbus components. The partner companies perform much of the subassembly in their own factories; for instance, wings for all Airbus aircraft are made in the United Kingdom, and tail subassemblies are made in Spain. Subassemblies are transported by road, rail, barge, ship, and aircraft (using a fleet of special jets, the Airbus Super Transporter Beluga) to final assembly lines in France, Germany, and China. Airbus A320, A330/A340, A380, and A350 aircraft are completed at a complex near Toulouse, while A318, A319, and A321 aircraft are assembled in Hamburg. In addition, A320 aircraft have been assembled in Tianjin, China, since 2008, and in 2012 Airbus announced that A320s would be assembled in Mobile, Alabama, starting in 2015.
