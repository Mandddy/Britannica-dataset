Arnold of Brescia, Italian Arnaldo da Brescia  (born c. 1100, Brescia, Republic of Venice—died c. June 1155, Civita Castellana or Monterotondo, Papal States) radical religious reformer noted for his outspoken criticism of clerical wealth and corruption and for his strenuous opposition to the temporal power of the popes. He was prior of the monastery at Brescia, where in 1137 he participated in a popular revolt against the government of Bishop Manfred. His proposals for reforming the clergy and for ending the church’s temporal powers caused him to be condemned as a schismatic by Pope Innocent II in 1139.
Banished from Italy, Arnold went to France, where he became a supporter of the renowned theologian and philosopher Peter Abelard. Both were condemned as heretics at the Council of Sens, France, in 1141, through the influence of St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Though Abelard submitted, Arnold defiantly continued teaching in Paris until, through the insistence of Bernard, he was exiled by King Louis VII the Young of France in 1141. Arnold fled first to Zürich, then to Passau, Ger., where he was protected by Cardinal Guido, through whose mediation he was reconciled with Pope Eugenius III at Viterbo, Papal States, in September 1145.
