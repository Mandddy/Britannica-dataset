Duke Snider, byname of Edwin Donald Snider, also called the Silver Fox and the Duke of Flatbush  (born September 19, 1926, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died February 27, 2011, Escondido, California) American professional baseball player who was best known for playing centre field on the famed “Boys of Summer” Brooklyn Dodgers teams of the 1950s.
Snider was raised in Compton, California, where he came to the attention of the Dodgers while playing for Compton Junior College. He signed with the organization in 1943 and made his major league debut in 1947. Snider earned a starting role in 1949, and he garnered the first of eight career All-Star selections during his second full-time season. One of the best sluggers of his era, he hit 40 or more home runs in each season from 1953 to 1957, including a league-leading 43 in 1956. Snider was frequently compared to two other All-Star centre fielders who played in New York City when he did—Willie Mays of the Giants and Mickey Mantle of the Yankees. Heated debates over which of the three was the superior player were common among that city’s baseball fans throughout the 1950s.
