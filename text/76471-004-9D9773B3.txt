Stephen Vincent Benét,  (born July 22, 1898, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died March 13, 1943, New York, New York) American poet, novelist, and writer of short stories, best known for John Brown’s Body, a long narrative poem on the American Civil War.
Born into a military family with literary inclinations, Benét was reared on army posts. His father read poetry aloud to Stephen, an older brother, William Rose, and a sister, Laura, all of whom became writers. Stephen published his first book at age 17. Civilian service during World War I interrupted his education at Yale University. He received his M.A. degree after the war, submitting his third volume of poems instead of a thesis.
