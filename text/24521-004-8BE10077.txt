Berthold Delbrück,  (born July 26, 1842, Putbus, Prussia [Germany]—died  Jan. 3, 1922, Jena, Ger.) German linguist who addressed himself to the problems of syntax (the patterning of words into meaningful phrases and sentences). He is credited with having founded the study of the comparative syntax of the Indo-European languages.
In 1871 Delbrück published his classic study of the subjunctive and optative moods in Sanskrit and Greek (Syntaktische Forschungen), which was the first thoroughly methodical and complete treatment of a problem in comparative syntax. He was professor of Sanskrit and comparative linguistics at the University of Jena (1873–1912). His great achievement was preparing the three volumes on syntax in Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen, 5 vol. (1886–93; Outline of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-European Languages). This work, with two volumes on grammar contributed by Karl Brugmann, was enlarged between 1897 and 1916 by the latter alone.
