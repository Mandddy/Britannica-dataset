AT&amp;T Corporation, formerly (1899–1994) American Telephone and Telegraph Company,  American corporation that provides long-distance telephone and other telecommunications services. It is a descendant of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which built much of the United States’ long-distance and local telephone networks, becoming the world’s largest corporation and a standard for the telecommunications industry. This firm voluntarily split into three smaller companies in 1996, one of which retained the AT&amp;T name.
The company’s origins date back to 1876, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone and made the first wire transmission of intelligible speech. Bell secured a patent for the device, and in 1877 he and two investors, Gardiner C. Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, formed the Bell Telephone Company, which they sold the next year to a group of financiers. The Bell Company was already embroiled in a race with the the leading telegraph company, Western Union Company, for the development of telephone service—Western Union by this time having acquired its own telephone devices and its own patents. Bell interests were represented by Theodore N. Vail, who was general manager from 1878 to 1887 and led the patent fight against Western Union. In 1879 Western Union, which was itself involved in a war of control between the Vanderbilts and Jay Gould, agreed to give up all its telephone patents, claims, and facilities in return for Bell’s promise to stay out of the telegraph business.
