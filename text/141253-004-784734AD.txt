Smelt,  any of certain silvery, chiefly marine food fishes, family Osmeridae, closely related to salmon and trout and found in cold northern waters. Smelts, like trout, have a small, adipose (fleshy) fin. They are slender carnivores and spawn short distances upstream, in the surf or in ponds.
The American smelt (Osmerus mordax) has been introduced from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes and supports a sizable commercial fishery. The largest smelt, about 37.5 cm (15 inches) long, spawns in late winter or spring, its sticky eggs adhering to objects they touch. The European smelt (O. eperlanus) is similar.
