Wuhan, Wade-Giles romanization Wu-han,  capital and major industrial and commercial city of Hubei sheng (province), China. It is located at the confluence of the Han and Yangtze rivers and consists of a conurbation of three adjacent former cities—Hankou (Hankow), Hanyang, and Wuchang. Hankou lies on the north bank of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) at the mouth of the Han River. Immediately across the Han from it is the older town of Hanyang, and across from these two, on the south bank of the Yangtze, is the ancient metropolis of Wuchang, which is the seat of the provincial government. In 1949 the government of the newly formed People’s Republic of China merged the three cities into the single entity of Wuhan.
The triple city of Wuhan has a geographical centrality that gives its site immense strategic and commercial significance. Lying at the very heart of China, it is roughly equidistant from the cities of Beijing and Guangzhou (Canton) on a north-south axis and also is equidistant from Shanghai and Chongqing on an east-west line. Pop. (2002 est.) 4,593,410; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 7,243,000.
