Aldus Manutius the Elder, Italian Aldo Manuzio il Vecchio, original name Teobaldo Manucci, also called Aldo Manuzio  (born 1449, Bassiano, Papal States [Italy]—died  Feb. 6, 1515, Venice) the leading figure of his time in printing, publishing, and typography, founder of a veritable dynasty of great printer-publishers, and organizer of the famous Aldine Press. Manutius produced the first printed editions of many of the Greek and Latin classics and is particularly associated with the production of small, excellently edited pocket-size books printed in inexpensive editions.
After studies in Rome and Ferrara, Manutius reached Venice in 1490 and gathered around him a group of Greek scholars and compositors. In March 1495 he issued his first dated book, the Erotemata of Constantine Lascaris. During 1495–98 he printed five volumes of Aristotle; in 1495, the Idylls of Theocritus and De Aetna of Pietro Bembo; and in 1498, works by Aristophanes and Politian.
