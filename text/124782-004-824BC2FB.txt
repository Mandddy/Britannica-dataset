Auction, the buying and selling of real and personal property through open public bidding. The traditional auction process involves a succession of increasing bids or offers by potential purchasers until the highest (and final) bid is accepted by the auctioneer (who is usually an agent of the seller). By contrast, in a so-called Dutch auction, the seller offers property at successively lower prices until one of his offers is accepted or until the price drops so low as to force the withdrawal of the offered property.
In any auction prospective buyers are usually permitted to examine the items for sale beforehand. The inspection period enables buyers to evaluate various lots, determine comparative grades or qualities, and arrive at a reasonable price to offer at auction time. Before the auction itself, the seller can set a “reserve”—i.e., a minimum price below which the property will not be sold. If bidding fails to meet the reserve, the auctioneer may withdraw the property without accepting the highest bid.
