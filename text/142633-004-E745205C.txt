Rove beetle (family Staphylinidae), any member of a family of numerous widely distributed insects in the order Coleoptera that are known for their usually elongated, slender bodies, their short elytra (wing covers), and their association with decaying organic matter. With an estimated 46,000 to 55,400 extant and extinct species, it is one of the largest beetle families known.
Rove beetles are usually found around decaying animal and vegetable matter, preying on carrion-feeding insects. Most of them are slender and small (usually less than 3 mm, or 1/8 inch); the largest species, such as the devilâ€™s coachhorse (Staphylinus olens), are usually no more than 25 mm (1 inch). The short, thick elytra protect the second, fully developed pair of flying wings. These functional wings can be unfolded rapidly from under the elytra when the beetle is ready for flight. They must be refolded carefully after use, however, often with the aid of both the abdomen and the legs, so as to fit under the elytra. When disturbed, the rove beetle raises the tip of its abdomen and may squirt a foul-smelling mist at its enemies. The wingless larvae resemble the adults.
