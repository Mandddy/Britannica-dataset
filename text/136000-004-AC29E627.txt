Autobahn, (
        German: “automobile road”) plural Autobahnen,  high-speed, limited-access highway, the basis of the first modern national expressway system. Planned in Germany in the early 1930s, the Autobahnen were extended to a national highway network (Reichsautobahnen) of 2,108 km (1,310 miles) by 1942. West Germany embarked on an ambitious reconstruction of the system after World War II, and after German reunification in 1989 the West German system (Bundesautobahnen) absorbed the East German system. The current length of the entire network is more than 12,000 km (7,200 miles), making it the third largest system in the world, after those of the United States and China.
