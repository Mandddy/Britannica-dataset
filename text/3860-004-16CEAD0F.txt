Sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), one of Africa’s most impressive antelopes and a member of the horse antelope tribe Hippotragini (family Bovidae), so-called because of their compact, powerful build, erect mane, thick necks, and sturdy build.
Sable bulls, with their glossy black (sable) coats set off by white underparts, rump, throat, and facial markings and their great scimitar-shaped horns, are a favorite quarry of trophy hunters. Females and young are chestnut to sorrel in colour; these pronounced colour differences make the sable antelope one of the most sexually dimorphic species in the bovid family. However, south of the Zambezi River, females of the H. niger niger (“black black”) subspecies also turn very dark. The sable is a large antelope, standing 117–140 cm (46–55 inches) tall. Bulls weigh about 235 kg (517 pounds) and females about 220 kg (480 pounds).
