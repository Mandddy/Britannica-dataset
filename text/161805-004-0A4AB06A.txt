Lobotomy, also called prefrontal leukotomy,  surgical procedure in which the nerve pathways in a lobe or lobes of the brain are severed from those in other areas. The procedure formerly was used as a radical therapeutic measure to help grossly disturbed patients with schizophrenia, manic depression and mania (bipolar disorder), and other mental illnesses.
Evidence that surgical manipulation of the brain could calm patients first emerged in the late 1880s, when Swiss physician Gottlieb Burkhardt, who supervised an insane asylum, removed parts of the brain cortex in patients suffering from auditory hallucinations and other symptoms of mental illness (symptoms later defined medically as schizophrenia). Burkhardt performed his operation on six patients, with the specific purpose not of returning the patients to a state of sanity but of putting them into a state of calm. One of Burkhardt’s patients died several days following the operation, and another later committed suicide (though it is unclear whether the suicide was associated with the surgery). However, several of the patients were easier to manage following the surgery. His idea for the operation had been influenced by the work of German physiologist Friedrich Goltz, who had performed brain ablation (surgical removal of tissue) experiments on dogs and observed distinct changes in the animals’ behaviour. In the decades following Burkhardt’s work, there were few attempts at surgical disruption of the human brain.
