Computer music, music utilizing digital computers and other electronic data-processing machinery developed about 1948 in application to musical composition and for musical research. The techniques of computer technology permit the indexing of specific genres, or types, of music (such as 16th-century Italian music or the works of a given composer) and have proved useful in the analysis of style, tonal and harmonic structure, and the process of composition.
In using a computer as a tool in composition, the composer programs the computer to produce pitches, rhythms, tone colours, and other musical elements and to screen these elements through criteria also chosen by the composer. The output may be transcribed for performance by conventional instruments or fed into another device for conversion into sound. In 1963, at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Max Vernon Mathews and his coworkers devised a computer capable of synthesizing sound directly. The composerâ€™s input, in the form of mathematical functions, is translated by the computer into synthesized musical sounds that are stored in digital form and can be played back at will. Because the machinery is flexible and precise, it can yield a wide variety of musical applications. Although a computer can be programmed to produce music in traditional styles and instrumental colours, its principal attraction to composers has been its ability to expand the previously available range of musical elements, such as tone colours and pitches, and the new approaches to musical form it makes possible.
