Muezzin, Arabic muʾaddin,  in Islam, the official who proclaims the call to prayer (adhān) on Friday for the public worship and the call to the daily prayer (ṣalāt) five times a day, at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and nightfall. To summon worshippers the Jews use a trumpet and the Christians use a bell, but the Muslims use the human voice. The muezzin is the servant of the mosque and is chosen for his good character. He stands either at the door or side of a small mosque or on the minaret (manāra) of a large one. He faces each of the four compass directions in turn: east, west, north, and south. To each direction he cries: “Allāh is most great. I testify that there is no God but Allāh. I testify that Muhammad is the prophet of Allāh. Come to prayer. Come to salvation. Allāh is most great. There is no God but Allāh.” Shīʾite muezzin add, “Come to the best work,” after “Come to salvation.” Many mosques have installed electronic recordings of the call to prayer, and amplifiers have displaced the muezzin.
