Monazite,  phosphate mineral, cerium and lanthanum phosphate, (Ce, La)PO4, that is the major commercial source of cerium. Occurring as small, brown, resinous, rather heavy crystals in granitic and gneissic rocks and their detritus (called monazite sands), monazite frequently contains 10â€“12 percent thorium dioxide (ThO2) and thus represents a major commercial source of thorium as well. Countries in which monazite is mined include India, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Brazil. For detailed physical properties, see phosphate mineral (table).
