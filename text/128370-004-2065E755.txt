Hugh Henry Brackenridge,  (born 1748, Kintyre, near Campbeltown, Argyll, Scot.—died  June 25, 1816, Carlisle, Pa., U.S.) American author of the first novel portraying frontier life in the United States after the Revolutionary War, Modern Chivalry (1792–1805; final revision 1819).
At five Brackenridge was taken by his impoverished family from Scotland to a farm in York county in Pennsylvania. After a local minister taught him Latin and Greek, he became a teacher and worked his way through the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), receiving his B.A. in 1771. For the commencement exercises he recited “The Rising Glory of America,” a patriotic poem that he had written with a classmate, Philip Freneau, who also was to make his name in American letters. Brackenridge went on to get his M.A. in theology at Princeton in 1774. An enthusiast for the Revolution, he joined George Washington’s army as chaplain. He published two verse dramas on Revolutionary themes, The Battle of Bunkers-Hill (1776) and The Death of General Montgomery at the Siege of Quebec (1777), and Six Political Discourses Founded on the Scripture (1778). In an attempt to promote native American literature, he established and edited The United States Magazine in 1779, but it failed within the year.
