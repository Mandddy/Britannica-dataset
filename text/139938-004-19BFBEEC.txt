Phil Mickelson, in full Philip Alfred Mickelson, byname Lefty  (born June 16, 1970, San Diego, California, U.S.) American professional golfer who became one of the most dominant players on the Professional Golfers’ Association of America (PGA) Tour in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Mickelson took to golf at an extremely young age, hitting his first golf balls at just age 18 months. He learned the basics of the sport by mirroring his father’s swing, which led the naturally right-handed Phil to adopt the left-handed stroke that would later lead to his nickname, “Lefty.” He won dozens of San Diego-area tournaments as a junior golfer, and he captured an unprecedented three consecutive national Junior Player of the Year awards (1986, 1987, 1988). His golfing prowess earned him a full scholarship to Arizona State University (ASU), where he established a reputation as one of the greatest American amateur golfers of all time. Mickelson was named first-team All-American in each of his four years at ASU, and he won three National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) individual championships (1989, 1990, 1992). In 1990 he won the U.S. Amateur Championship, and the following year he won his first PGA Tour event, the Northern Telecom Open, becoming only the fourth amateur to win a PGA tournament.
