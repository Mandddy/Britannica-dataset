Edward Prentiss Costigan,  (born July 1, 1874, King William County, Va., U.S.—died  Jan 17, 1939, Denver, Colo.) American lawyer and politician, member of the U.S. Tariff Commission (1916–28) and a U.S. senator from Colorado (1930–36).
Costigan spent most of his youth in Colorado, where his parents moved in 1877. He graduated from Harvard University in 1899 and began his law practice in Denver the next year. His interest in good government led him to join nonpartisan organizations designed to improve municipal and state government in Colorado, including the Direct Primary League, which he helped organize. A Republican and a supporter of Theodore Roosevelt, Costigan bolted the party to help organize the Progressive Party of Colorado in 1912 and to become its unsuccessful candidate for governor in that year and again in 1914. As an attorney he represented the Denver Chamber of Commerce and the United Mine Workers of America in federal litigation.
