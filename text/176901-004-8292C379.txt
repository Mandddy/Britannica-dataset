John Boorman,  (born January 18, 1933, Shepperton, Middlesex [now Surrey], England) British director who was one of the most distinctive stylists of his generation.
Boorman began writing film reviews while a teenager. After a stint in the British military, he moved to television in 1955, editing and filming documentaries. He joined the BBC a few years later, rising to the head of their documentary division by 1962. He had great critical success with his series of documentaries Citizen 63, which describe what the British citizen in 1963 was really like, rather than how he described himself. In 1964 Boorman directed The Newcomers, a popular six-part study of a couple from Bristol.
