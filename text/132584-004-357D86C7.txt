George Walbridge Perkins,  (born Jan. 31, 1862, Chicago—died  June 18, 1920, Stamford, Conn., U.S.) U.S. insurance executive and financier who organized the health insurance agency system and the corporate structures of several large companies. He also served as chairman of Theodore Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, organizing Roosevelt’s 1912 presidential campaign.
When Perkins became an office boy for the New York Life Insurance Company in 1877, the company gave charge of territories to general agents who then hired their own salesmen. The salesmen had no company loyalty and often made exaggerated claims for a policy to get the premium. By 1892 Perkins was third vice president in charge of all agencies. Instead of contracting with general agents, he hired local salesmen directly and made them permanent employees. In 1896 he developed a new system of employee benefits based on number of years on the job and policies sold.
