Abyssal hill, small, topographically well-defined submarine hill that may rise from several metres to several hundred metres above the abyssal seafloor, in water 3,000 to 6,000 metres (10,000 to 20,000 feet) deep. Typical abyssal hills have diameters of several to several hundred metres. They elongate parallel to spreading centres or to marine magnetic anomalies and cover the entire flanks and crests of oceanic ridges. Abyssal hill provinces, areas of abyssal seafloor occupied exclusively by such hills, characteristically occur seaward of the smooth abyssal plains at the bases of continental rises. Isolated hills and groups of hills also protrude from abyssal plain surfaces, and the base of an abyssal plain accumulation of marine sediment, as revealed by sub-bottom seismic profiling, generally matches the undulating topography and relief of abyssal hill provinces.
Apparently, the hills are constructed by two processes: volcanism and block faulting. The relative contribution of each may depend on the spreading rate. At slower rates, faulting of the oceanic crust is a dominant factor in forming the relief, and the relief of the hills is greater as the rate is slower. At the crest of a spreading centre, volcanism in the neovolcanic zone initiates the construction of volcanic hills. The zone of active faulting is where they form or are modified by block faulting. The existence of discrete and separate volcanic hills indicates that volcanism at a spreading centre is episodic.
