Pakicetus, extinct genus of early cetacean mammals known from fossils discovered in 48.5-million-year-old river delta deposits in present-day Pakistan. Pakicetus is one of the earliest whales and the first cetacean discovered with functional legs. In addition, it still retained many other features of terrestrial mammals, including an auditory system that was better for hearing in air than in water, a dentition not unlike that of its closest terrestrial relatives, such as the mesonychids, and functional feet capable of locomotion on land.
The body mass of Pakicetus was estimated at 45 kg (100 pounds), roughly the size of a wolf or large dog. The dentition of the animal indicates that it had a diet primarily of fish; however, its skeleton and skull suggest that it spent a considerable amount of time on land.
