Louise Labé, original name Louise Charly, byname La Belle Cordière (French: “The Beautiful Rope Maker”)   (born c. 1524, Lyon, France—died  1566, Parcieux-en-Dombes) French poet, the daughter of a rope maker (cordier).
Labé was a member of the 16th-century Lyon school of humanist poets dominated by Maurice Scève. Her wit, charm, accomplishments, and the freedom she enjoyed provoked unverifiable legends, such as those claiming she rode to war, was taken to dressing like a man, and was a cultured courtesan. In 1555 she published a book of love sonnets, which are remarkable for their emotional intensity and their stylistic simplicity and which probably relate to her passion for the poet Olivier de Magny. The same volume also contained a prose dialogue, Débat de Folie et d’Amour (“Debate of Love and Folly”).
