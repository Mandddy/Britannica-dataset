Langston University was established by Oklahoma’s territorial legislature in 1897 as the Colored Agricultural and Normal (teacher-training) University. It was coeducational from the outset. African American settlers raised money to buy land for the school, which opened in a Presbyterian church in 1898. It was renamed Langston University (for African American educator and public official John Mercer Langston) in 1941. The E (Kika) de la Garza Institute for Goat Research is located there, and the university also conducts extension and research programs on topics such as grasslands resources.
