Marne River,  river, northern France, 326 miles (525 km) long, rising 4.5 miles (7.2 km) south of Langres on the Langres Plateau. Flowing north-northwest in a wide valley past Chaumont and Saint-Dizier, it then turns west before veering northwest to skirt Vitryle-François and Châlons-sur-Marne; it then flows west to Épernay, where it crosses undulating wine-growing country. After flowing through Château-Thierry, it meanders through grain-growing lands and passes La Ferté-sousJouarre and Meaux before making a wide loop southeast of Paris and entering the Seine River at Charenton, an eastern suburb of Paris. Its drainage basin covers some 5,000 square miles (13,000 square km) in all. Important canalization works, entailing the submerging of three villages in the Saint-Dizier area, have been undertaken to regulate the flow of the Marne as well as that of the Seine. The Marne is accompanied by a canal from its source to a lock northwest of Épernay, where its own channel is canalized. At Vitry-le-François two canals separate, one leading toward the Saône River, the other toward the Rhône River; both are ancient and in disrepair. The Marne River valley saw heavy fighting in World War I.
