John Snow,  (born March 15, 1813, York, Yorkshire, England—died June 16, 1858, London)  English physician known for his seminal studies of cholera and widely viewed as the father of contemporary epidemiology. His best-known studies include his investigation of London’s Broad Street pump outbreak, which occurred in 1854, and his “Grand Experiment,” a study comparing waterborne cholera cases in two regions of the city—one receiving sewage-contaminated water and the other receiving relatively clean water. Snow’s innovative reasoning and approach to the control of this deadly disease remain valid and are considered exemplary for epidemiologists throughout the world. Snow’s reputation in anesthesiology, specifically in regard to his knowledge of ether and chloroform, was considerable, such that he was asked to administer chloroform to Queen Victoria when she gave birth in 1853 to Prince Leopold and in 1857 to Princess Beatrice. Snow’s achievements are considered remarkable, given his humble origin and short life; a stroke caused his death at age 45.
Snow was born in York, England, where his father worked as a labourer in a coal yard. He was the firstborn in a family of nine children. At age 14, after spending his early years at a school in York, he left home and pursued three consecutive medical apprenticeships in various regions of Yorkshire. In 1831, when visiting coal miners, he had his first encounter with cholera, a disease that would later become the focus of his scientific endeavours. By 1836 Snow had begun his formal medical education, eventually receiving a doctor of medicine degree (1844) from the University of London. In 1849 he became a licentiate (licensed specialist) of the Royal College of Physicians of London, rising to an elite level in the medical profession. He lived, conducted research, and maintained a medical practice in the Soho neighbourhood of London.
