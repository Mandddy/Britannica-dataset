Katharine Hepburn, in full Katharine Houghton Hepburn  (born May 12, 1907, Hartford, Conn., U.S.—died June 29, 2003, Old Saybrook, Conn.) indomitable American stage and film actress, known as a spirited performer with a touch of eccentricity. She introduced into her roles a strength of character previously considered to be undesirable in Hollywood leading ladies. As an actress she was noted for her brisk upper-class New England accent and tomboyish beauty.
Hepburn’s father was a wealthy and prominent Connecticut surgeon, and her mother was a leader in the woman suffrage movement. From early childhood, Hepburn was continually encouraged to expand her intellectual horizons, speak nothing but the truth, and keep herself in top physical condition at all times. She would apply all of these ingrained values to her acting career, which began in earnest after her graduation from Bryn Mawr College in 1928. After scoring her first major Broadway success in The Warrior’s Husband (1932), she was invited to Hollywood by RKO Radio Pictures.
