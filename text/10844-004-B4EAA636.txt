Eelgrass, any of two different groups of ribbonlike aquatic plants in the order Alismatales. The first group of eelgrass comprises the 6â€“10 members of the genus Vallisneria (family Hydrocharitaceae), also called tape grass or vallis. These perennial herbs grow fully submerged in fresh or brackish water and are native to temperate and tropical waters around the world. The plants are dioecious (bearing only male or female flowers) and feature a unique aquatic pollination system. (For more on its unusual pollination see Alismatales.) Vallisneria species have long thin leaves that grow in a clustered rosette and can reproduce asexually from creeping underground rhizomes and stolons. Some species, namely V. spiralis and V. americana, are often grown in aquariums and are an important food for wild ducks.
The second group of eelgrass is the Zosteraceae family, commonly called the eelgrass family, consisting of 14 species in two genera, Phyllospadix and Zostera. Found in temperate and subtropical climates around the world, these species are annual or perennial marine herbs that grow in intertidal and subtidal portions of coastal areas. They have long alternate leaves that grow from spreading rhizomes and can form large underwater meadows. Most Zosteraceae species are monoecious (individuals bear both male and female flowers) and feature underwater pollination. Historically, common eelgrass (Z. marina) was an important tidewater plant whose dried leaves were used for packing glass articles and for stuffing cushions. Phyllospadix plants are more commonly known as surf grass.
