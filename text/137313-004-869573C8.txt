Black duck,  (Anas rubripes), highly prized game bird (family Anatidae) of eastern North America, inhabiting salt, brackish, and freshwater marshes, as well as lakes, rivers, and beaver ponds. These ducks winter from Nebraska to Texas and along the Atlantic coast from Nova Scotia to Florida; their preference for seafoods such as periwinkles and mussels enables them to winter so far north. The sexes are similar in appearance—blackish brown bodies and tan heads—resembling a mallard hen but with reddish feet. The white underwing is conspicuous during flight.
The African black duck (A. sparsa), of sub-Saharan Africa, is not a close relative. It dives more than other dabbling ducks and is less social. Some authorities consider it a link with the perching duck group.
