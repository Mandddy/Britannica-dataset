Clinical trial, formal testing of a specific treatment or other health-related intervention to determine its role in the standard care of individuals with a corresponding medical condition.
Ideally, before new drugs and other treatments, diagnostic tests, or preventive measures are accepted for general use, they should be studied in clinical trials to determine whether they have advantages over existing methods in health benefits, safety, or cost. At times, approaches already in common use are compared in a clinical trial to determine if one is superior.
