Saskatchewan River,  largest river system of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, rising in the Canadian Rockies of western Alberta in two great headstreams, the North and South Saskatchewan rivers (800 miles [1,287 km] and 865 miles [1,392 km] long, respectively); these cross the Saskatchewan provincial boundary 200 miles (320 km) apart and unite east of Prince Albert. The combined streams continue eastward for 340 miles (550 km) to enter Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba) via Cedar Lake; at Grand Rapids, the point of influx, there is hydrodevelopment along a short, turbulent stretch of water. The Saskatchewan is 1,205 miles (1,939 km) long from the head of the Bow River, chief headstream of the South Saskatchewan, and drains an area of 148,000 square miles (383,000 square km).
The river, named from a Cree word meaning “swift-flowing current,” was for long an important fur-trading route after first being explored by Henry Kelsey in 1690. Now of little navigational value, it is widely used for hydroelectric power and irrigation. The river is the site of several major dams (the largest of which is the Gardiner Dam, impounding Diefenbaker Lake, south of Saskatoon), and its basin contains Canada’s largest irrigation district (more than 1,000,000 acres [400,000 hectares] along the South Saskatchewan River). Important cities, including Edmonton, Calgary, Lethbridge, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, Saskatoon, and Prince Albert, are located on the Saskatchewan or on its tributaries—the Battle, Bow, Oldman, and Red Deer rivers.
