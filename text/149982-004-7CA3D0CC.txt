Amu Darya, English Amu River, Tajik Daryoi Amu, Turkmen Amyderya, Uzbek Amudaryo, ancient name Oxus River,  one of the longest rivers of Central Asia. The Amu Darya was traditionally known to the Western world from Greek and Roman times as the Oxus and was called the Jayḥūn by the Arabs. It allegedly derives its present name from the city of Āmul, which is said to have occupied the site of modern Türkmenabat (formerly Chärjew) in Turkmenistan. As well known as it was in antiquity, the river nevertheless received but little attention in Europe until the reign of Peter I the Great, tsar of Russia. Though the first relatively authentic map of the river was made in 1734, systematic research in the region began only at the end of the 19th century. At the end of the 1920s, a map of the entire Amu Darya basin was published in Tashkent.
The river is formed by the confluence of the Vakhsh and Panj (Pyandzh) rivers (at which point it becomes known as the Amu Darya) and flows west-northwest. In its upper course the Amu Darya forms part of Afghanistan’s northern border with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It then flows across the desert of eastern Turkmenistan and in its lower course forms part of the boundary between Uzbekistan to the northeast and Turkmenistan to the southwest. The Amu Darya is 879 miles (1,415 km) long, but its length is 1,578 miles (2,540 km) if measured from the sources of its headstream, the Panj River, in the Pamirs. In the past the Amu Darya discharged into the Aral Sea, but the diversion of river water for agriculture in the 20th and 21st centuries has contributed to the shrinking of the Aral Sea and ensured that the river no longer reaches its historic terminus.
