Giovanni Battista Pirelli (b. Dec. 27, 1848, Varenna, Como, Austrian Empire [Italy]â€”d. Oct. 20, 1932, Milan, Italy) was educated in Milan, and it was there in 1872 that he started a small rubber factory, the first in Italy and one of the first in all of Europe. It pioneered the manufacture of electric cable (1884) and in 1899 began producing automobile tires. In 1902 the company began its foreign expansion by starting a subsidiary factory in Spain.
