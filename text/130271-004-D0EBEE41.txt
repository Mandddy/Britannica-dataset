Patrice Tlhopane Motsepe,  (born Jan. 28, 1962, Soweto, S.Af.) South African businessman and the country’s first black billionaire. Motsepe made his fortune through mining interests that eventually expanded in 2004 to form a successful multifaceted mining company, African Rainbow Minerals (ARM).
In spite of having grown up in the apartheid era, Motsepe fared better than many other South African blacks. His father, once banished for voicing opposition to apartheid, became a successful liquor distributor by affiliating with South African Breweries. Throughout his youth Motsepe worked at his father’s store and beer hall, a job that gained him essential lessons in business management and exposed him to the lives of the mine workers who bought their daily provisions from him. Largely because of his father’s opposition to South Africa’s segregated public school system, which provided the country’s blacks with poor educational opportunities, Motsepe and his six siblings attended a Roman Catholic boarding school in Eastern Cape province. Motsepe then earned a bachelor’s degree in law from the University of Swaziland and a law degree from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. He joined the law firm of Bowman Gilfillan in 1988 and became a partner in 1993, having worked as a visiting attorney with the American law firm McGuire, Woods, Battle &amp; Booth in 1991–92.
