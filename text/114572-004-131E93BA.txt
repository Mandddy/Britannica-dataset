Charente River,  river in western France, about 225 miles (360 km) long, rising near Rochechouart in the Limousin uplands (Haute-Vienne département), on the margin of the Massif Central, and flowing generally westward to the Bay of Biscay. Taking a northwesterly course to Civray (Vienne département), it makes a wide loop and meanders south to Angoulême, capital of Charente département, and then flows gently westward through Cognac and Saintes (Charente-Maritime département). The river receives its chief tributary, the Boutonne, from the plain of Poitou to the north, before making a southern loop round Rochefort, 5 miles (8 km) from its mouth, east of the island of Oléron. It is navigable for small craft as far as Angoulême.
