Spitzer Space Telescope, U.S. satellite, the fourth and last of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration fleet of “Great Observatories” satellites. It was designed to study the cosmos at infrared wavelengths. The Spitzer observatory began operating in 2003 and was expected to spend at least six years gathering information on the origin, evolution, and composition of planets and smaller bodies, stars, galaxies, and the universe as a whole. It was named in honour of Lyman Spitzer, Jr., an American astrophysicist who in a seminal 1946 paper foresaw the power of astronomical telescopes operating in space.
The Spitzer observatory was launched on Aug. 25, 2003, by a Delta II rocket. To remove the spacecraft from Earth’s thermal radiation effects, it was placed into a heliocentric, or solar, orbit with a period of revolution that causes it to drift away from Earth at a rate of 0.1 astronomical unit (15 million km, or 10 million miles) per year. This orbit differs radically from the low Earth orbits used by Spitzer’s sister Great Observatories—the Hubble Space Telescope, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
