Angelus Silesius, original name Johannes Scheffler   (born December 1624, Breslau, Silesia [now Wrocław, Pol.]—died  July 9, 1677, Breslau) religious poet remembered primarily as the author of Der Cherubinischer Wandersmann (1674; “The Cherubic Wanderer”), a major work of Roman Catholic mysticism.
The son of a Lutheran Polish nobleman, Scheffler was court physician to the Duke of Oels in his native Silesia when his readings in the mystics, especially Jakob Böhme, and in the Church Fathers led him to the Roman Catholic church, into which he was received in 1653. After six years as physician to the Holy Roman emperor Ferdinand III, at Vienna, he returned to Breslau and was ordained to the priesthood in 1661. He was fanatical in his opposition to Protestantism, and he contributed some 55 polemical pieces to a Lutheran-Catholic controversy that was notable even in that day for its harshness.
