António Nobre,  (born August 16, 1867, Porto, Portugal—died March 18, 1900, Foz do Douro) Portuguese poet whose verse expresses subjective lyricism and an aesthetic point of view.
Nobre was a member of a wealthy family. He studied law unsuccessfully at Coimbra and, from 1890 to 1895, studied political science in Paris, where he was influenced by the French Symbolist poets. There he wrote the greater part of the only book he published in his lifetime, Só (1892; “Alone”), inspired by nostalgic memories of a childhood spent in the company of peasants and sailors in northern Portugal. Só combines the simple lyricism of Portuguese traditional poetry with the more refined perceptiveness of Symbolism.
