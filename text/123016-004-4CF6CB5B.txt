Nantong, Wade-Giles romanization Nan-t’ung,  city, eastern Jiangsu sheng (province), China. It is situated on the northern shore of the head of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) estuary. Northward, it is connected with the Tongyang and Tonglü canal systems, which serve the coastal zone of Jiangsu north of the Yangtze and connect westward with the Grand Canal. Tiansheng port, about 7.5 miles (12 km) to the west, and Nantong port provide Nantong with ports on the Yangtze. Another port at Langshan, some 8 miles (13 km) south of Nantong, has been developed since the 1990s; this facility has greatly expanded the handling capacity of the ports group administered by the city and has made Nantong one of the largest ports along the Chinese coast.
During the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce), and even as late as the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) periods, the seacoast was much farther west than at present, and the area now called Nantong was an outlying county, Hailing, subordinate to Yangzhou. It grew into a commercial, communications, and strategic centre and became a prefecture (zhou) under the name of Tong in 958. After 1368 it lost its prefectural status and again became a county subordinate to its wealthy neighbour, Yangzhou. In 1724, however, it was again created a prefecture and was given the name Nantong (“Southern Tong”) to avoid confusion with Tongzhou, near Beijing. After 1912 it became a county, retaining its old name.
