Lag ba-ʿOmer, also spelled Lag Bʾomer, or Lag Be-omer,  a minor Jewish observance falling on the 33rd day in the period of the counting of the ʿomer (“barley sheaves”); on this day semimourning ceases and weddings are allowed. The origin of the festival is obscure. Among many traditions, one has it that manna first fell from heaven on this day; another tradition claims that a plague that raged among the followers of Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph during ʿomer ceased on this day. In Meron in Upper Galilee, Israel, Orthodox Jews by the thousands make a joyous pilgrimage to the burial site of the great rabbi Simeon ben Yoḥai, and young children receive their first haircuts as part of a popular celebration that includes playing with bows and arrows (symbols of the rainbow) and dancing around a bonfire at night.
