Beverly Sills, original name Belle Miriam Silverman  (born May 25, 1929, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died July 2, 2007, New York City) American operatic soprano who won international fame many years before her Metropolitan Opera debut at age 46. After retirement from her singing career, she became a notable arts advocate and fund-raiser.
Sills was early destined by her mother for a career in the performing arts. At age four, as “Bubbles” Silverman, she first appeared on Uncle Bob’s Rainbow House, a Saturday morning radio program, and she became a regular. She won a prize on Major Bowes’s The Original Amateur Hour at age 10, made a couple of motion picture shorts, and became a regular on Major Bowes Capitol Family Hour and, later, on the radio soap opera Our Gal Sunday, on which she played a “nightingirl of the mountains.” At age 12 she retired to complete her education in public schools and at the Professional Children’s School in New York, from which she graduated in 1945. Also that year she toured with a Gilbert and Sullivan opera company and in 1947 made her operatic debut with the Philadelphia Civic Opera. She spent several years traveling with touring opera companies and making guest appearances in various opera centres throughout the United States. In 1955 she became a member of the company of the New York City Opera and made her debut as Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus.
