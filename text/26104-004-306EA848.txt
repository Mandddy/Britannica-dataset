Harlan Fiske Stone,  (born Oct. 11, 1872, Chesterfield, N.H., U.S.—died  April 22, 1946, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1925–41) and 12th chief justice of the United States (1941–46). Sometimes considered a liberal and occasionally espousing libertarian ideas, he believed primarily in judicial self-restraint: the efforts of government to meet changing 20th-century social and political conditions should be restricted only on the basis of unconstitutionality rather than undesirability.
Stone graduated from Amherst College in 1894 and received his law degree in 1898 from the law school of Columbia University. He then taught at Columbia from 1899 and served as the dean of its law school from 1910, while also conducting a private law practice in New York City. President Calvin Coolidge appointed him attorney general of the United States (1924), in which post he reorganized the Federal Bureau of Investigation after its reputation had been tarnished by the Teapot Dome and other scandals of President Warren G. Harding’s administration. Stone’s effectiveness prompted Coolidge to appoint him an associate justice of the Supreme Court (1925), and President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted him to chief justice in succession to Charles Evans Hughes (1941).
