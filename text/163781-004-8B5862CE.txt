Mathilde, queen of Belgium, original name Mathilde Marie Christine Ghislaine d’Udekem d’Acoz  (born January 21, 1973, Uccle, Belgium) consort of Philippe, king of Belgium, and mother of Princess Elisabeth (born 2001), the heir to the Belgian throne.
Mathilde was the daughter of a judge and a countess, and she completed her education in Bastogne before attending the Institut de la Vierge Fidèle in Brussels. In 1994 she graduated with a degree in speech therapy from the Institut Libre Marie Haps, also in Brussels, and set up a practice there. The circumstances under which she first met the prince have not been made public, but the two reportedly had been involved for several years before announcing their engagement in September 1999. The country, long divided by the political and cultural differences between French-speaking Wallonia and Flemish-speaking Flanders, welcomed Mathilde, who was fluent in both languages as well as in English and Italian.
