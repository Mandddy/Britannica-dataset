Top,  a toy having a body of conical, circular, or oval shape, often hollow, with a point or peg on which it turns or is made to whirl. If given a knock, a spinning top will go around in a circle at a slant; if spun with a slant at the start, it will quickly stand upright until halted by friction. Its physical properties are similar to those of the gyroscope. Some tops, as the common peg top, are spun by means of a cord. Whipping tops are kept spinning by whips with a lash. Other tops are spun by a twist of the hand or the action of a spring or a plunger. Some hollow tops, such as the thunder tops of Japan, have holes cut in them to produce a hum or roar.
Tops were known to the ancient Greeks, and the Romans constructed tops out of boxwood or terra-cotta. The top was known in Europe as early as the 14th century, and in Shakespeareâ€™s day a large village top was frequently kept for use in cold weather as a warming-up exercise.
