Tyrone,  former (until 1973) county, Northern Ireland. It was bounded by the former counties of Londonderry (north) and Fermanagh and Monaghan (south), and by former County Armagh and Lough (lake) Neagh (east). It had an area of 1,260 square miles (3,263 square km). In the north, the Sperrin Mountains rise to 2,224 feet (678 m), the highest peaks being Sawel and Mullaghcloga. To the southwest, Bessy Bell (1,387 feet) and Mary Gray (803 feet) straddle the River Mourne. Sandstones and limestones are most common in the south and west of former Tyrone County. The moorlands of the mountainous regions are unproductive, but the river valleys are extremely fertile. Lough Neagh, the largest lake in the British Isles, is on what was the eastern boundary. The climate is temperate, with an average annual rainfall of more than 55 inches (1,400 mm) in the mountainous north.
The former county derived its name from Tir Eoghain (land of Eoghan, son of Niall of the Nine Hostages). From the 5th to the 16th century ad, the O’Nialls (or O’Neills) were rulers of this territory, and successive chiefs were installed at Tullaghoge near Dungannon. After the flight (1607) of Hugh O’Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, from the English, ownership of his vast estates lapsed and passed to the crown; the lands were subsequently divided and granted by the king under the scheme for the Plantation of Ulster. Royalist forces under Lord Mountjoy established fortifications at strategic points; and Tyrone became colonized. In 1688–89 troops of James II occupied part of Tyrone, and Omagh was severely damaged.
