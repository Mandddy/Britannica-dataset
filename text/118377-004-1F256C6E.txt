West African monsoon, a major wind system that affects West African regions between latitudes 9째 and 20째 N and is characterized by winds that blow southwesterly during warmer months and northeasterly during cooler months of the year. Although areas just outside of this region also experience wind reversals, the influence of the monsoon declines with increasing distance.
The main characteristics of the West African seasons have been known to the scientific community for more than two centuries. The southwest winter monsoon flows as a shallow humid layer of surface air (less than 2,000 metres [about 6,600 feet]) overlain by the primary northeast trade wind, which blows from the Sahara and the Sahel as a deep stream of dry, often dusty air. As a surface northeasterly, it is generally known as the harmattan, gusty and dry in the extreme, cool at night and scorchingly hot by day. As in a thorough monsoonal development, upper tropospheric anticyclones occur at about 20째 N, while the easterly jet stream may occur at about 10째 N, much closer to the Equator than they are in the Indian region.
