Richard M. Daley, in full Richard Michael Daley  (born April 24, 1942, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American lawyer and politician, who became mayor of Chicago in 1989 and who played a major role in transforming it into a dynamic international city.
Richard M. Daley is the first son of Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago from 1955 to 1976 and considered “the last of the big city bosses.” The younger Daley graduated from DePaul University in 1964 and earned a law degree there in 1968. He was elected as a Democrat to the Illinois Senate in 1972 and served there until 1980. That year he became the state’s attorney of Cook county. In the 1983 Chicago mayoral race, Daley unsuccessfully ran against incumbent Jane Byrne and Harold Washington for the Democratic nomination; Washington won and went on to become the city’s first African American mayor. The following year Daley was reelected state’s attorney. After Washington died in office in 1987, Daley won a special mayoral election in 1989 and easily won subsequent elections.
