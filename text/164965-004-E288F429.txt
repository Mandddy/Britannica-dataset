Akiba ben Joseph,  (born 40 ce—died c. 135, Caesarea, Palestine [now in Israel]) Jewish sage, a principal founder of rabbinic Judaism. He introduced a new method of interpreting Jewish oral law (Halakha), thereby laying the foundation of what was to become the Mishna, the first postbiblical written code of Jewish law.
The subject of numerous popular legends, Akiba is said to have been an illiterate shepherd who began to study after the age of 40. His devoted wife, Rachel, supported him both morally and materially during this arduous period of late learning (12 years, according to one account). His principal teachers were the great masters of the Law, Eliezer ben Hyrcanus and Joshua ben Hananiah. Akiba established his academy in Bene Beraq (near present-day Tel Aviv–Yafo), and the leading sages of the following generation, especially Meïr and Simeon ben Yoḥai, were his disciples.
