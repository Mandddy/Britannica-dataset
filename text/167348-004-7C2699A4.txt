Fitzroy River,  river in eastern Queensland, Australia, formed by the confluence of the Dawson and Mackenzie rivers, on the slopes of the Eastern Highlands. The united stream flows northeast across the Broadsound Range and then southeast through distributaries to enter Keppel Bay on the Coral Sea of the Pacific Ocean after a course of 300 mi (480 km). Its catchment area with its main tributary, the 100-mi Margaret River, is 55,000 sq mi (142,000 sq km). The Fitzroy is navigable from Port Alma, at the mouth, 35 mi upstream to Rockhampton. Other towns along the river, which is named after Sir Charles Fitz Roy, governor of New South Wales (1845â€“55), are Morgan, Clermont, Springsure, and Emerald. Experimental pasturing and rice farming are practiced along the lower floodplain.
