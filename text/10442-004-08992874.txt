Ewald Christian von Kleist,  (born March 7, 1715, Zeblin, Pomerania—died  Aug. 24, 1759, Frankfurt an der Oder, Brandenburg) German lyric poet best known for his long poem Der Frühling, which, with its realistically observed details of nature, contributed to the development of a new poetic style.
Brought up by Jesuits, he studied law and mathematics and then became an army officer, first in Denmark and then in 1740 in Prussia. In Potsdam, while in service, he met Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim, through whose influence and friendship he first became a poet. The happiest years of his life were 1757 and 1758, when he became close friends with the writer Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and came in contact with the literary circle in Leipzig. From this period come his patriotic and heroic poems, inspired by his experience in the Seven Years’ War, Ode an die Preussische Armee (1757) and the short epic Cessides und Paches (1759), considered to be the most polished of all his poems. Der Frühling (1749), influenced by the Scottish poet James Thomson’s Seasons, is typical of his heartfelt nature poetry in which passionate love for nature is expressed in vivid imagery. Wounded in the battle of Kunersdorf, he died the “death for the fatherland” of which he had written in his poetry.
