Espalier,  tree or other plant that is trained to grow flat against a support (such as a trellis or wall). The term also denotes the trellis or other support on which such trees or plants are trained, as well as the method or technique itself. Espalier was developed in Europe to encourage fruit-tree production in an incompatible climate, and the technique originally employed a wall to provide necessary heat as well as support.
Decorative or space-saving espaliers use metal, wire, or wooden frames to create ornamental shapes for shrubbery or to train tree-growth on trellises, on stone, brick, or glass walls, or on fences. One method requires tip-pruning after the desired growth is reached, with auxiliary branches tied to a horizontal frame slightly above ground level. Evergreens such as loquat, fire thorn, sweet bay magnolia, and upright yew, as well as dwarf apple and pear trees, make excellent espaliers.
