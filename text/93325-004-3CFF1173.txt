Jerónimo de Balbás,  (born  c. 1680, Zamora, Spain—died 1748, Mexico City, Viceroyalty of New Spain [now in Mexico]) Spanish architect and sculptor who helped create Mexican Baroque architecture with his introduction to Mexico of the style usually called Churrigueresque (sometimes Ultrabaroque). This style is characterized by an element known as the estípite column (a square or rectangular column hidden in various places by receding and protruding planes separated by elaborate decorative elements). These columns serve as support for highly ornate Baroque decoration, primarily imitative of vegetation. His adopted son, Isidoro Vincente Balbás (c. 1720–83), also a sculptor and architect, continued his father’s work in the same style.
Jerónimo de Balbás spent the early part of his career in Madrid before moving to Sevilla. There he designed the main altar of the sacristy in the Sevilla Cathedral, an example of the Churrigueresque because of its use of estípites, tumbling angels, and a cornice interrupted in multiple places. The altar was completed in 1709 and was destroyed in 1824.
