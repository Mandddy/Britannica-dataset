Sir Ralph Abercromby,  (born Oct. 7, 1734, Tullibody, Clackmannan, Scot.—died  March 28, 1801, at sea in the Mediterranean) soldier whose command restored discipline and prestige to the British army after the disastrous campaigns in the Low Countries between 1793 and 1799. He prepared the way for the successful campaign against Napoleon Bonaparte in Egypt.
Entering the army in 1756, Abercromby served in the Seven Years’ War. When war with Revolutionary France broke out in 1793, he commanded a brigade under the Duke of York in Flanders. He commanded the army’s rear column in its retreat from the Netherlands during the winter of 1794–95. Returning home, he was made a Knight of the Bath and appointed to the command of the British forces in the West Indies, where he seized the French sugar islands. He served under the Duke of York in the second expedition to the Netherlands in 1799. In 1800, after the failure of a descent on Cádiz, Spain, he was ordered to Egypt to expel or destroy the army left there by Bonaparte. Landing at Abū Qīr Bay on March 8, 1801, he advanced toward Alexandria. A French attack before daybreak on March 21 was beaten back with heavy loss, but Abercromby was mortally wounded. He died on board the flagship Foudroyant and was buried at Malta.
