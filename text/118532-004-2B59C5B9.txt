Sir Alec Issigonis, in full Sir Alexander Arnold Constantine Issigonis   (born Nov. 18, 1906, Smyrna [now İzmir], Tur.—died  Oct. 2, 1988, Birmingham, Eng.) British automobile designer who created the best-selling, economical Mini and the perennially popular Morris Minor.
The son of a Greek merchant, Issigonis immigrated to London in 1922 during the war between Greece and Turkey. After studying engineering, he joined Morris Motors in 1936 as a suspension designer. There he developed the Morris Minor, which remained in production from 1948 to 1971. A reliable car with excellent steering and cornering qualities, it was the first all-British car to pass the one million mark in sales; surviving models are still cherished by owners and collectors.
