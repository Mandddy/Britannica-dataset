The Lion in Winter, British dramatic film, released in 1968, that is noted for its brilliant, biting dialogue and the stellar performances of Katharine Hepburn and Peter O’Toole as Eleanor of Aquitaine and Henry II, respectively.
Based on a Broadway play, the witty film drama recounts the troubled marriage between Henry II and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom he keeps as a near-prisoner 11 months out of the year. The two butt heads when she is released for her annual Christmas visit, sparring over the king’s new lover and over which of their three unworthy sons should inherit the throne.
