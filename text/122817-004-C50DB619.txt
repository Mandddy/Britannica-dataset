Amy Winehouse,  (born September 14, 1983, London, Englandâ€”died July 23, 2011, London) British singer-songwriter who skyrocketed to fame as a result of the critically acclaimed multiple Grammy Award-winning album Back to Black (2006) but whose tempestuous love life, erratic behaviour, and substance-abuse problems stalled her recording career even as they made her a favourite subject of tabloid journalism.
Winehouse was born to a Jewish family and was raised primarily by her mother, a pharmacist, who divorced her father, a taxicab driver, when Winehouse was nine. Early on she demonstrated an interest in the arts, but she was expelled from Sylvia Young theatre school for wearing a forbidden nose ring. At the prestigious BRIT School, Winehouse showed ability as an actor as well as a singer, and by age 16 she was performing with jazz groups. On her critically acclaimed debut album, Frank (2003), she proved herself to be a shrewd, caustic lyricist, and her smoky, evocative vocals drew comparisons to jazz and rhythm-and-blues legends Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, and Billie Holiday.
