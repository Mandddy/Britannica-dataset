Tertiary Period, interval of geologic time lasting from approximately 66 million to 2.6 million years ago. It is the traditional name for the first of two periods in the Cenozoic Era (66 million years ago to the present); the second is the Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago to the present). The Tertiary has five principal subdivisions, called epochs, which from oldest to youngest are the Paleocene (66 million to 55.8 million years ago), Eocene (55.8 million to 33.9 million years ago), Oligocene (33.9 million to 23 million years ago), Miocene (23 million to 5.3 million years ago), and Pliocene (5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago).
Beginning in the late 20th century, a number of authorities preferred not to use the terms Tertiary and Quaternary, preferring instead to divide the time intervals encompassed by each into two different intervals known as the Paleogene Period (66 million to 23 million years ago) and the Neogene Period (which previously spanned the interval between 23 million years ago and the present). In 2005 the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) decided to recommend keeping the Tertiary and Quaternary in their geologic time scale but only as sub-eras within the Cenozoic. The sub-era structure was abandoned by the ICS in 2008, and the Tertiary Period became officially replaced by the Paleogene and Neogene periods. (At present, the Neogene encompasses the interval between 23 million and 2.6 million years ago.)
