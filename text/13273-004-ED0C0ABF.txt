River Avon, also called East Avon or Hampshire Avon,  river that rises 3 miles (5 km) east of Devizes, Wiltshire, England, on the north side of the Vale of Pewsey and flows generally southward for 48 miles (77 km) to the English Channel. The river shares the name Avon (derived from a Celtic word meaning “river”) with several other rivers in Great Britain, including the Avon of Bristol (or Lower Avon) and the Avon of Warwickshire (or Upper Avon).
The Avon has a drainage area of 1,132 square miles (2,932 square km) and a fall of 500 feet (150 metres). From Upavon southward to Salisbury, the river meanders widely among meadowlands of the Salisbury Plain in a narrow valley with many villages and much evidence of early settlement. Below Salisbury the valley is wider, with several watercourses in places, but there are few towns near the riverbanks. It enters the English Channel through the nearly landlocked Christchurch harbour. The main tributaries are the Bourne (from the east) and the Wylye (from the west) at Salisbury and the Stour (from the west) just above Christchurch. The river is navigable to Salisbury and probably was well traveled in prehistoric times. It has salmon fisheries and a variety of coarse fish.
