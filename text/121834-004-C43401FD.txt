Greenling,  any of a number of marine fish of the family Hexagrammidae (order Scorpaeniformes). Greenlings are characterized, as a group, by such features as small scales, long dorsal fins, and strong jaw teeth. Members of the family usually do not exceed a length of about 45 or 46 cm (18 inches). They are carnivorous fish, valued as food, and are found in the North Pacific. Included in the group are the Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), a banded, black and yellow fish valued for food and sport; the lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), a large, predatory North Pacific species; and the ainame (Hexagrammos otakii), a common food fish of Japan.
