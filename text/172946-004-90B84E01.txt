After studying at the Royal College of Music, Butt made her debut in 1892 as Ursula in Sir Arthur Sullivan’s cantata The Golden Legend.

She also became popular as a ballad singer. Sir Edward Elgar wrote his song cycle Sea Pictures (1899) for her, and she inspired the part of the angel in his oratorio Dream of Gerontius. In 1900 she married the baritone Kennerley Rumford, with whom she gave recitals. One of her few opera appearances was as Orfeo in Christoph Willibald Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice.
