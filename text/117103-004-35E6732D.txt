University of Oxford, English autonomous institution of higher learning at Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, one of the worldâ€™s great universities. It lies along the upper course of the River Thames (called by Oxonians the Isis), 50 miles (80 km) north-northwest of London.
Sketchy evidence indicates that schools existed at Oxford by the early 12th century. By the end of that century, a university was well established, perhaps resulting from the barring of English students from the University of Paris about 1167. Oxford was modeled on the University of Paris, with initial faculties of theology, law, medicine, and the liberal arts.
