Celia Cruz, in full Úrsula Hilaria Celia Caridad Cruz Alfonso  (born October 21, 1925, Havana, Cuba—died July 16, 2003, Fort Lee, New Jersey, U.S.) Cuban American singer who reigned for decades as the “Queen of Salsa Music,” electrifying audiences with her wide-ranging, soulful voice and rhythmically compelling style.
Cruz grew up in Santos Suárez, a district of Havana, in an extended family of 14. After high school she attended the Normal School for Teachers in Havana, intending to become a literature teacher. After winning a talent show, however, in which she interpreted the tango piece “Nostalgia” in a bolero tempo, Cruz interrupted her studies to pursue a singing career. Her musical breakthrough came in 1950 when she replaced lead singer Myrta Silva of the popular orchestra La Sonora Matancera. Cruz sang regularly with the ensemble on radio and television, toured extensively, and appeared with it in five films produced in Mexico. She also recorded with La Sonora Matancera, and beginning with Canta Celia Cruz (1956; “Celia Cruz Sings”), her songs with the group were compiled as full-length albums. In addition, Cruz headlined Havana’s Tropicana nightclub in the 1950s.
