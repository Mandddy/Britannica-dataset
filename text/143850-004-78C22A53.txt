The Cooper Hewitt was originally founded in 1896 by the granddaughters of American industrialist Peter Cooper and opened to the public the following year. In 1968 it became part of the Smithsonian Institution. The museum is located in the Carnegie Mansion on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. The 64-room mansion, a national landmark, is itself an example of design innovation, having been the first American home to have a steel frame and central heating. The Cooper Hewitt was the first—and for many years the only—American museum dedicated solely to design. Its library is also renowned.
