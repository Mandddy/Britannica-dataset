Royal jelly, also called Bee Milk,  thick, white, nutritious substance fed to bee larvae. Secreted from glands in the heads of worker bees, it is fed to worker and drone larvae until the third day of life and to queen bee larvae throughout the larval period. Its components include water, proteins, carbohydrates, and various trace elements (mineral salts) and vitamins. It is rich in pantothenic acid, a vitamin substance aiding metabolism of fats and carbohydrates and also contains vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, important in metabolism of amino acids.
Because of the large amounts that would be required to produce beneficial effects in humans and the availability of the same nutrients from other sources, royal jelly is not considered valuable in human nutrition. It has been used in such cosmetics as facial creams and skin conditioners, but claims of its rejuvenating properties have not been substantiated.
