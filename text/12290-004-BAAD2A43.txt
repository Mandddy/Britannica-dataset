Sir Anton Dolin, original name Sydney Francis Patrick Chippendall Healey-kay   (born July 27, 1904, Slinfold, Sussex, Eng.—died  Nov. 25, 1983, Paris, France) British ballet dancer, choreographer, and director who, with his frequent partner Alicia Markova, founded the Markova-Dolin companies and London’s Festival Ballet.
Trained by the notable Russian teachers Serafima Astafieva and Bronislava Nijinska, Dolin began his ballet career in 1921 in the corps de ballet of Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. As a soloist with Diaghilev’s company, he created the leading role in Nijinska’s Train Bleu (1924) and an important role (one of two Servants) in George Balanchine’s Prodigal Son (1929). Dolin was considered to be one of the finest partners of his time. He eventually danced leading roles in numerous classical ballets but was also noted for such creations as Satan in Ninette de Valois’s Job (1931) and the title role in Michel Fokine’s Bluebeard (1941).
