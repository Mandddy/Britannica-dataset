Pregnancy test, procedure aimed at determining whether a woman is pregnant. Pregnancy tests are based on a detectable increase in human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the blood serum and urine during early pregnancy. HCG is the principal hormone produced by the chorionic layers of the placenta, the temporary organ that provides nourishment for the developing fetus. Levels of HCG increase significantly following implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterine wall, which occurs sometime between 6 and 12 days after fertilization.
In home pregnancy tests, which are qualitative (determining whether HCG is present), a small amount of urine is applied to a chemical strip. The result is usually indicated by some visible change in the strip (whether this is a change in colour or the appearance of a symbol depends upon the way in which the test is manufactured). A positive home pregnancy test should be confirmed with a laboratory test and pelvic examination by a doctor. Pregnancy tests performed in a laboratory on a sample of blood or urine are quantitative and therefore are more accurate than a home pregnancy test. Laboratory tests using a sample of blood also have a high degree of sensitivity and can be used to detect increased levels of HCG early in the implantation process.
