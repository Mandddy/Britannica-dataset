Gene Hackman, in full Eugene Alden Hackman  (born January 30, 1930, San Bernadino, California, U.S.) American motion-picture actor known for his rugged appearance and his emotionally honest and natural performances. His solid dependability in a wide variety of roles endeared him to the public.
Hackman left home at age 16 and enlisted in the marines for five years, entering the Korean conflict. He began a study of journalism and television production at the University of Illinois but left it to pursue acting at the Pasadena Playhouse in California. He found work in a number of summer stock and Off-Broadway plays in New York, as well as a bit part as a policeman in the film Mad Dog Coll (1961). He landed his first Broadway role in 1964 as a young suitor in Muriel Resnickâ€™s Any Wednesday. His performance attracted the attention of Hollywood agents, and Hackman was subsequently cast in the film Lilith (1964), which starred Warren Beatty.
