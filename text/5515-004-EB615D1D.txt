Ambush bug (subfamily Phymatinae), any of 291 species of bugs (order Heteroptera) that are most abundant in the tropical Americas and Asia and that hide on flowers or other plant parts, from which they ambush their prey. When prey approaches closely enough, the ambush bug grasps it with its front legs. The upper section (tibia) of each foreleg has teethlike structures that mesh into similar structures on the lower, greatly thickened leg section (femur). Holding its victim in these pincers, the ambush bug inserts its short beak and sucks out the body fluids. Even though the ambush bug is small (usually less than 12 mm, or 0.5 inch), its prey may be as large as a bumblebee, wasp, or butterfly.
Ambush bugs have an odd shape, with lateral extensions and rounded projections. The Asian genus Carcinocoris is covered with spines. Members of Phymata are among the most-common North American representatives; they frequently are seen lurking on garden plants.
