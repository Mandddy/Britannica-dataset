The Andrews Sisters, singing trio, one of the most popular American musical acts of the 1940s. The group’s renditions of swing tunes in close harmony sold millions of copies; the act was also hugely popular in live performance and in film. The sisters were LaVerne Sofia Andrews (b. July 6, 1911, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.—d. May 8, 1967, Brentwood, California), Maxene Angelyn Andrews (b. January 3, 1916, Minneapolis—d. October 21, 1995, Boston, Massachusetts), and Patricia Marie (“Patty”) Andrews (b. February 16, 1918, Minneapolis—d. January 30, 2013 , Los Angeles, California).
As teenagers, the Andrews Sisters formed a singing act and began performing in vaudeville reviews throughout the Midwest. Their singing was initially influenced by the Dixieland style of the Boswell Sisters of New Orleans, but they soon expanded their repertoire to include a wide range of current song types. Patty Andrews, a soprano, was lead singer for the trio, Maxene sang second soprano, and LaVerne took the lowest line.
