John Amos Comenius, Czech Jan Ámos Komenský  (born March 28, 1592, Nivnice, Moravia, Habsburg domain [now in Czech Republic]—died  Nov. 14, 1670, Amsterdam, Neth.) Czech educational reformer and religious leader, remembered mainly for his innovations in methods of teaching, especially languages. He favoured the learning of Latin to facilitate the study of European culture. Janua Linguarum Reserata (1632; The Gate of Tongues Unlocked) revolutionized Latin teaching and was translated into 16 languages.
Comenius was the only son of respected members of a Protestant group known as the Bohemian Brethren. His parents died when he was age 10, and after four unhappy years spent living with his aunt in Strážnice, he was sent to a secondary school at Přerov. Though the teaching methods there were poor, he was befriended by a headmaster who recognized his gifts and encouraged him to train for the ministry. Following two years at the Herborn Gymnasium in the Nassau region (now part of Germany), he entered the University of Heidelberg (1613). While there he came under the influence of Protestant millennialists, who believed that men could achieve salvation on earth. He also read with enthusiasm the works of Francis Bacon and returned home convinced that the millennium could be attained with the aid of science.
