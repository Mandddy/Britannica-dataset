Michael Johnson, in full Michael Duane Johnson   (born September 13, 1967, Dallas, Texas, U.S.) American sprinter, perhaps the most eminent figure in athletics (track and field) in the 1990s. For much of the decade he was virtually unbeaten in the long sprints—the 200-metre and 400-metre races—and he held world records in the indoor 400 metres and the outdoor 200 metres. At the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia, he became the first man to win gold medals at both distances; he also set Olympic marks in both events.
In high school Johnson was one of the top 200-metre runners in Texas. After entering Baylor University in Waco, Texas, in 1986, he first began competing at 400 metres. In 1989, during his junior year, he set the indoor 200-metre U.S. record to win the national collegiate title—a title that he defended his senior year, both indoors and outdoors.
