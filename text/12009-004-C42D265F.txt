Antaeus,  in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaea. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.
Although many works of art from the Classical period show the wrestling match of Heracles and Antaeus, none earlier than a Hellenistic coin from Tarentum in Italy show Heracles lifting Antaeus. Ovid, in Metamorphoses, Book IX, is the first author to describe Antaeusâ€™s strength as coming from contact with the ground.
