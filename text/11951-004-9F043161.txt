Fanwort, also called water shield,  any of about seven species of aquatic flowering plants constituting the genus Cabomba, of the fanwort or water-shield family (Cabombaceae), native to the New World tropics and subtropics. Water shield is also the more commonly used name for Brasenia, the only other genus of the family.
The narrow, floating leaves of fanwort are about 5 to 20 mm (1/5 to 3/4 inch) long and appear at the time of flowering. A slimy leafstalk attaches the centre of the leaf blade to the stem and roots, which are anchored in mud. The submerged leaves, 2 to 5 cm (about 3/4 to 2 inches) wide, are finely divided and fan shaped. The pale-yellow or white flowers are about 5.5 mm to 1 cm (1/5 to 2/5 inch) long. Cabomba caroliniana, sometimes called Washington grass, fish grass, or Carolina water shield, is the most common species in North America. It is often cultivated as an aquarium plant.
