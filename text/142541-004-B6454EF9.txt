Steve Carell, byname of Steven John Carell  (born August 16, 1962, Concord, Massachusetts, U.S.) American comedian and actor known for both his television work—most notably on The Daily Show and The Office—and his numerous films.
After graduating from Denison University in Granville, Ohio (1984), Carell moved to Chicago, where he joined the improvisational troupe Second City in 1989. Two years later he made his film debut in Curley Sue. Other film and television work followed, including various roles on the television sitcom The Dana Carvey Show (1996), for which he also wrote. Carell’s big break came in 1999, when he began appearing on The Daily Show, a satiric news program hosted by Jon Stewart. Cast as a clueless correspondent, he became popular for such segments as “Even Stephven,” in which he debated castmate Stephen Colbert. In 2005 he left The Daily Show to star in the American version of The Office, a British sitcom cocreated by Ricky Gervais. Filmed as a mock documentary, the series centres on the employees at a branch of the paper company Dunder Mifflin. For his portrayal of the delusional and socially challenged manager Michael Scott, Carell received numerous Emmy Award nominations, and in 2006 he won a Golden Globe. Amid much fanfare, Carell departed The Office in 2011.
