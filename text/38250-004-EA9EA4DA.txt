Remora, also called sharksucker or suckerfish,  any of eight species of marine fishes of the family Echeneidae (order Perciformes) noted for attaching themselves to, and riding about on, sharks, other large marine animals, and oceangoing ships. Remoras adhere by means of a flat, oval sucking disk on top of the head. The disk, derived from the spiny portion of the dorsal fin, contains a variable number of paired, crosswise plates.
Remoras are thin, elongated, rather dark fishes from 30 to 90 cm (1 to 3 feet) long; they live in warmer waters and are found around the world. Remoras feed on the leavings of their hostsâ€™ meals or, in some instances, act as cleaners by eating the external parasites of their transporters.
