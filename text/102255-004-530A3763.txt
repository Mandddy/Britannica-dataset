Adenet Le Roi, also called Roi Adam, Li Rois Adenes, Adan Le Menestrel, or Adam Rex Menestrallus  (born c. 1240—died c. 1300) poet and musician, interesting for the detailed documentary evidence of his career as a household minstrel.
He received his training in the court of Henry III, duke of Brabant, at Leuven; after his patron’s death in 1261, his fortunes wavered, owing to dynastic rivalries and the growth of Flemish literature at court, until in 1268 or 1269 he entered the service of Guy of Dampierre, heir to the county of Flanders, as principal minstrel (whence his title roi—i.e., “king of minstrels”). Adenet accompanied Guy in 1270–71 on the Tunisian crusade, and his poems contain many precise references to parts of their return through Sicily and Italy. Of his rather pallid and unoriginal written work, three chansons de geste are preserved: Buevon de Conmarchis, Les Enfances Ogier (“The Youthful Exploits of Ogier the Dane,” part of the Charlemagne legends), and Berte aus grans piés (“Berta of the Big Feet”). Also extant is Cléomadès, a romance about a flying wooden horse, written at the suggestion of Marie de Brabant, daughter of his old patron and queen of Philip III of France.
