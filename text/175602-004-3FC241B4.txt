The Bad and the Beautiful, American film drama, released in 1952, that—highlighted by an Academy Award-nominated performance by Kirk Douglas—helped solidify the unflattering popular image of the ruthless Hollywood mogul.
The film, most of which is told in flashback, traces the rise and fall of Hollywood producer Jonathan Shields (played by Douglas), who achieves fame and fortune but surrenders his humanity in the process. Three of his “victims”—an actress (Lana Turner), a director (Barry Sullivan), and a screenwriter (Dick Powell)—recount their relationship with Shields, who has asked them to work on a project that he hopes will lead to his comeback.
