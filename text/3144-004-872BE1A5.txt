Soma Cube, irregular shape formed by combining three or four similar cubes along several faces. There are seven different Soma Cubes, though two of them are mirror images of each other. The Danish mathematician Piet Hein, also known for his invention of the mathematical games known as hex and tac tix, stumbled upon the fact that the seven Soma Cubes can be put together to form a larger cube containing 27 “unit” cubes. He patented his idea for the Soma Cubes in 1934.
Many interesting solid shapes can be formed from the seven Soma Cubes, shapes resembling, for example, a sofa, a chair, a castle, a tunnel, a pyramid, and so on. Even the assembling of the seven basic pieces into a large cube can be done in more than 230 essentially different ways.
