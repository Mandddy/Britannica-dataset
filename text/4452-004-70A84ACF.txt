Stinkbug (family Pentatomidae), any of about 5,000 species of insects in the true bug order, Heteroptera, that are named for the foul-smelling secretions they produce. These odours may be transferred to the resting place of the insect, such as plants, fruits, or leaves, giving them a disagreeable or nauseating taste.
Their combination of colour (brown, green, or metallic) and shape (oval, broad, and slightly convex) camouflages many of these insects as they sit on bark and foliage. The head and prothorax form a triangle that points forward. Stinkbugs generally range between 5 and 12 mm (0.2 and 0.5 inch) in length. Sexual dimorphism, a condition in which the appearance of the male and female differs, exists in some species.
