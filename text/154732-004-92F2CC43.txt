Fred Shuttlesworth, original name in full Freddie Lee Robinson  (born March 18, 1922, Mount Meigs, Alabama, U.S.—died October 5, 2011, Birmingham, Alabama) American minister and civil rights activist who established, with Martin Luther King, Jr., and others, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and who worked to end segregation in the South.
Shuttlesworth, the eldest child of a large family, grew up poor on his stepfather’s farm in rural Alabama. Following his high school graduation, he worked as a truck driver until he was inspired to pursue a life in the church. While studying at Selma University (B.A., 1951) and Alabama State College (now Alabama State University; B.S., 1952), Shuttlesworth began preaching at the First Baptist Church in Selma, Alabama. He left Selma in 1952 to take over as pastor of Birmingham’s Bethel Baptist Church.
