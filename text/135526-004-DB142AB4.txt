Said Halim Paşa,  (born 1863, Cairo—died  Dec. 6, 1921, Rome) Ottoman statesman who served as grand vizier (chief minister) from 1913 to 1916.
The grandson of Muḥammad ʿAlī Pasha, a famous viceroy of Egypt, Said was educated in Turkey and later in Switzerland. In 1888 he was appointed a member of the state judicial council. In 1911 he became the foreign minister in Mahmud Şevket’s Cabinet. After Mahmud Şevket’s death Said was made grand vizier. Although he signed the treaty of alliance with Germany in 1914, he was known to oppose Ottoman participation in World War I. He was ready to resign at the outset of war, but he remained at his post at the insistence of the ruling Committee of Union and Progress. In 1916, however, he did resign, and then he became a member of the Senate. After the armistice signed at Mudros (Oct. 30, 1918), he was banished to Malta by British authorities. On his release he went to Rome, where he was assassinated by an Armenian.
