Prehnite,  pale green to gray, glassy silicate mineral that commonly lines cavities in igneous rocks. It also occurs as stalactite masses. Prehnite is a secondary or hydrothermal mineral that is a basic calcium and aluminum silicate, Ca2Al2Si3O10(OH)2, and is often associated with zeolites. Prehnite has been found in Italy, Germany, France, Scotland, and New Jersey in the United States. Clear specimens of fine colour are sometimes cut for gem use and marketed under the name Cape emerald. For detailed physical properties, see silicate mineral (table).
