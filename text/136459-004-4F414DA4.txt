Buyei, also spelled Bouyei, Wade-Giles romanization Puyi, formerly Zhongjia, also called Jui or Yoi,  an official minority group inhabiting large parts of Guizhou province in south-central China. They call themselves Jui or Yoi. There are also some 50,000 Buyei living in Vietnam, where they are an official nationality. They had no written script of their own until 1956, when the Chinese communists supplied them with one based on the Latin alphabet. Most Chinese Buyei are bilingual, speaking both a Tai dialect and Chinese.
A Chinese account of 1730 relates that the Buyei were a Chinese group banished to Guizhou in pre-Christian times. More likely they were a Tai group forced from more favoured agricultural lowlands into the poorer valley lands of the Guizhou plateau and hills. In the early 21st century they numbered nearly three million and still inhabited Guizhou, distributed mostly at the south of the province and in the valley of the Nanpan River. The related Dong people, with a population of roughly equivalent size, inhabit the districts east of them.
