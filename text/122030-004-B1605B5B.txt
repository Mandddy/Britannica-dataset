Corn oil,  edible oil obtainable from the seeds (kernels) of corn (maize), valued for its bland flavour and light colour.
The oil constitutes about half of the germ (embryo) of the corn kernel, which is separated from the rest of the kernel during the operation of milling to produce meal, animal feed, hominy, breakfast foods, or other edible solids. The corn germ is dried in a kiln, and the oil is extracted by either a hydraulic or a screw press; the pressed cake is further treated by washing it with a solvent, ordinarily hexane, and the dissolved oil is recovered by evaporating the solvent. The oil cake remaining after solvent extraction is ground and used as an animal fodder known as hominy feed.
