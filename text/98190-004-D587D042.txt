Dog show, competition in which purebred dogs are judged on the basis of their physical perfection as determined by breed standards or on performance criteria such as agility, tracking, obedience, or herding. In some performance shows, “companion dogs” of mixed breeds are allowed to compete. Dog shows in the United States are held according to rules set up by the American Kennel Club (AKC); shows in Great Britain follow the rules of the Kennel Club; other such groups include the United Kennel Club (UKC) and the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA). Local kennel clubs worldwide sponsor dog shows, sometimes specializing in national breeds. Shows may feature only a specific breed or group (the seven AKC groups are Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding).
The first English dog show was held in Newcastle in 1859, and a more ambitious one followed at Chelsea in 1863. The best known of English dog shows is Crufts, which has been held annually in London since 1886. The first formal dog show in the United States was held in 1877, sponsored by the Westminster Kennel Club. The annual shows sponsored by this kennel club, in New York City, and by the International Kennel Club, in Chicago, are two of the most important dog shows in the United States.
