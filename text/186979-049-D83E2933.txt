Frankfurter, also called wiener, or (in the United States) hot dog,  highly seasoned sausage, traditionally of mixed pork and beef. Frankfurters are named for Frankfurt am Main, Ger., the city of their origin, where they were sold and eaten at beer gardens.
Frankfurters were introduced in the United States in about 1900 and quickly came to be considered an archetypal American food. The first so-called hot-dog stand, selling the sausages as a sandwich on what was to become the standard long hot-dog bun, was opened at Coney Island, New York, in 1916. The hot dog remained popular in the United States throughout the 20th century, being especially associated with barbecues, picnics, and athletic events.
