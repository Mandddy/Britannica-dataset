Acetylcholine, an ester of choline and acetic acid that serves as a transmitter substance of nerve impulses within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Acetylcholine is the chief neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of the autonomic nervous system (a branch of the peripheral nervous system) that contracts smooth muscles, dilates blood vessels, increases bodily secretions, and slows heart rate.
Acetylcholine is stored in vesicles at the ends of cholinergic (acetylcholine-producing) neurons. In the peripheral nervous system, when a nerve impulse arrives at the terminal of a motor neuron, acetylcholine is released into the neuromuscular junction. There it combines with a receptor molecule in the postsynaptic membrane (or end-plate membrane) of a muscle fibre. This bonding changes the permeability of the membrane, causing channels to open that allow positively charged sodium ions to flow into the muscle cell (see end-plate potential). If successive nerve impulses accumulate at a sufficiently high frequency, sodium channels along the end-plate membrane become fully activated, resulting in muscle cell contraction.
