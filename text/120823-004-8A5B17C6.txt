Elodea, genus of five or six species of submerged aquatic plants in the frogâ€™s-bit family (Hydrocharitaceae), useful in aquariums and in laboratory demonstrations of cellular activities. Elodea plants are native to the New World, though a number of species have established themselves as invasive species in ponds and quiet waterways. Canadian waterweed (Elodea canadensis), for example, has naturalized in Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe and is an obstacle to lake navigation in many areas.
Elodea are herbaceous perennials that feature dark green leaves arranged in whorls of two to seven along the stem. Plants are usually dioecious (individuals bear either male or female flowers only) and produce seeds in ellipsoid or oval capsules. The plants reproduce readily by asexual fragmentation, and many invasive populations consist entirely of individuals of the same sex, having originated from a single, introduced, plant fragment. While the thin and wiry roots can anchor the plants into soft substrate, Elodea also grows well floating.
