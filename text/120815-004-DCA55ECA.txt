Sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica), also called humble plant,  plant in the pea family (Fabaceae) that responds to touch and other stimulation by rapidly closing its leaves and drooping. Native to South and Central America, the plant is a widespread weed in tropical regions and has naturalized elsewhere in warm areas. It is commonly grown as a curiosity in greenhouses.
The plant is a spiny subshrub and grows to a height of about 30 cm (1 foot). It has compound leaves and small globular pink or mauve flower puffs. The plantâ€™s unusually quick response to touch is due to rapid water release from specialized cells located at the bases of leaflet and leaf stalks. The leaves reopen in several minutes, and it is thought that this adaptation is a defense against browsing herbivores who may be startled by the movement. In addition to its response to physical stimuli, the leaves also droop in response to darkness and reopen with daylight, a phenomenon known as nyctinastic movement.
