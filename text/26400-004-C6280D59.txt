Johann Lukas Schönlein,  (born Nov. 30, 1793, Bamberg [Germany]—died  Jan. 23, 1864, Bamberg) German physician whose attempts to establish medicine as a natural science helped create modern methods for the teaching and practice of clinical medicine.
A professor of medicine at the universities of Würzburg (1824–33), Zürich (1833–40), and Berlin (1840–59), Schönlein was the first to use the microscope in conjunction with chemical analyses of urine and blood in the diagnosis of disease. He found and described (1839) the fungus (Achorion schonleinii) responsible for the skin disease favus and coined the term hemophilia (1828).
