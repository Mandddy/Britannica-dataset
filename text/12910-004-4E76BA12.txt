Christian III,  (born Aug. 12, 1503, Gottorp, Schleswig—died  Jan. 1, 1559, Kolding, Den.) king of Denmark and Norway (1534–59) who established the state Lutheran Church in Denmark (1536) and, by forming close ties between the church and the crown, laid the foundation for the absolutist Danish monarchy of the 17th century.
The eldest son of Frederick I, king of Denmark and Norway, Christian was educated as a Lutheran and showed Protestant zeal as statholder (chief executive) in the Danish provinces of Schleswig and Holstein (1526). The predominantly Catholic Rigsråd (Council of the Realm) therefore rejected his bid for the throne when Frederick died in 1533, preferring Christian’s younger brother Hans. Meanwhile, the burgomasters of Copenhagen and Malmö allied with the north German city of Lübeck to restore the imprisoned former Danish king Christian II and provoked a civil war (the Count’s War; 1533–36) when Lübeck’s forces invaded Holstein.
