Lucy Burns,  (born July 28, 1879, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died Dec. 22, 1966, Brooklyn) American suffragist whose zealous political organizing and militant tactics helped forge support for a federal constitutional amendment guaranteeing women the vote.
Burns was the fourth of eight children. Fortunate to have a father who believed in educating children of both sexes, Burns in 1902 graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. Over the next seven years, she did graduate work in linguistics, first at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and then—after a hiatus during which she taught English at Erasmus Hall, a public high school in Brooklyn—at the Universities of Berlin, Bonn, and Oxford. In England, having become interested in the struggle to secure the vote for women, she soon left school to work full-time for her chosen cause. As a close colleague of suffragist leaders Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, Burns earned a special medal from the Pankhursts’ Women’s Social and Political Union for the bravery she exhibited in the course of several arrests and prison hunger strikes.
