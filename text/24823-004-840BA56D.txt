Victor, Baron Horta,  (born January 6, 1861, Ghent, Belgium—died September 8, 1947, Brussels) an outstanding architect of the Art Nouveau style, who ranks with Henry van de Velde and Paul Hankar as a pioneer of modern Belgian architecture.
Horta began his studies in architecture in 1873 at the Académie des Beaux-Arts and then at Athénée Royal (1874–77), both in Ghent, Belgium. He moved to Brussels in 1881 and attended the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts, where he was a pupil of the Neoclassical architect Alphonse Balat. His first independent building, the four-storied Hôtel Tassel in Brussels (1892–93), was among the first Continental examples of Art Nouveau, although it incorporated Neo-Gothic and Neo-Rococo stylistic elements. An important feature was its octagonal hall with a staircase leading to various levels. The curved line, characteristic of the Art Nouveau style, was used on the facade and also in the interior. Other buildings in Brussels in his rich, elegant style are Hôtel Solvay (1895–1900), notable for the plastic treatment of its facade, and Hôtel Winssingers (1895–96), as well as his own house on the rue Américaine (1898). His chief work is the Maison du Peuple, Brussels (1896–99), which was the first structure in Belgium to have a largely iron and glass facade. In its auditorium the iron roof beams are both structural and decorative.
