Menninger family, American physicians who pioneered methods of psychiatric treatment in the 20th century.
Charles Frederick Menninger (born July 11, 1862, Tell City, Indiana, U.S.—died November 28, 1953, Topeka, Kansas) began practicing general medicine in Topeka in 1889 and became convinced of the benefit of group medical practice after visiting the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1908. Menninger was joined in practice by his son Karl Augustus Menninger (born July 22, 1893, Topeka—died July 18, 1990, Topeka), who received a medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1917 and spent two years working under Ernest Southard at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital. In 1919 the two Menningers established the Menninger Diagnostic Clinic in Topeka for the group practice of general medicine. Karl Menninger’s strong interest in psychiatry and the Topeka area’s lack of hospital care for the mentally ill led him to treat psychiatric patients as well. In 1924 Charles Menninger’s youngest son, William Claire Menninger (born October 15, 1899, Topeka—died September 6, 1966, Topeka), received an M.D. from Cornell University Medical College and served his internship at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. The following year he joined the family practice.
