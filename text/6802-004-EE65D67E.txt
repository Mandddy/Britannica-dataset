Paul Bourget, in full Paul-Charles-Joseph Bourget   (born Sept. 2, 1852, Amiens, France—died  Dec. 25, 1935, Paris) French novelist and critic who was a master of the psychological novel and a molder of opinion among French conservative intellectuals in the pre-World War I period.
After completing his studies in philosophy, Bourget began his career as a poet, and several of his poems were set to music by Claude Debussy. Encouraged and deeply influenced by the critic Hippolyte Taine, he published a series of essays tracing the sources of contemporary pessimism to the works of Stendhal, Gustave Flaubert, Charles Baudelaire, Taine, and Ernest Renan. Fashionable in their day because of their high-society setting, his early novels, such as Cruelle Énigme (1885), Un Crime d’amour (1886), and André Cornélis (1887), were careful psychological studies.
