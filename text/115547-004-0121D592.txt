Macquarie Island, subantarctic island, Tasmania, Australia, lying about 930 miles (1,500 km) southeast of the main island of Tasmania. Macquarie, a volcanic mass with an area of 47 square miles (123 square km) and a general elevation of 800 feet (240 metres), measures 21 by 2 miles (34 by 3 km) and has several rocky islets offshore. Recognized as the only place in the world where rocks from Earth’s mantle are actively exposed above sea level (a result of geologic activity), the island is an exposed portion of the seabed, the Macquarie Ridge, where the Pacific and Indian-Australian plates meet. Earthquakes occur there about once per year. Rounded hills rise some 1,200 to 1,400 feet (365 to 425 metres), and the coast falls steeply away. Although the island is treeless, there are a variety of native vegetation types, including grasses and many species of moss. There are a few small glacial lakes.
The island was sighted in 1810 by Frederick Hasselborough, an Australian sealer, who named it for Lachlan Macquarie, then governor of New South Wales. Hasselborough noted at the time the presence of a wrecked ship “of ancient design,” presumably Polynesian. The island was a centre for seal hunting until 1919. It has no permanent human population, but a meteorologic and geologic research station has been maintained on the island since 1948, and many botanists and biologists have studied the local flora and fauna.
