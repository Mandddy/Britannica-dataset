Hans Sachs,  (born November 5, 1494, Nürnberg, Germany—died  January 19, 1576, Nürnberg) German burgher, meistersinger, and poet who was outstanding for his popularity, output, and aesthetic and religious influence. He is idealized in Richard Wagner’s opera Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.
Wagner’s opera is partly a tribute to the common people—and Sachs was one of them. The son of a tailor, he was apprenticed to a shoemaker in 1509 after studying at a Latin school. He became a master cobbler in about 1519. Many guild workmen and tradesmen of that day practiced a type of singing based on elaborate rules; to become meistersingers (“master singers”), they had to prove themselves in a contest. Sachs became a master in the Nürnberg Singschule in about 1520, conducted a school of meistersingers at Munich, and headed the Nürnberg group in 1554.
