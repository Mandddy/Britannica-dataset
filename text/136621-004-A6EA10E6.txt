Hotel dieu, French Hôtel-dieu,  in France, any medieval hospital; the name now refers only to those whose history goes back to the Middle Ages. Many examples from the Gothic period still remain, notably that of Angers (1153–84), the so-called salle des morts at Ourscamp (early 13th century), and that of Tonnerre (c. 1300).
In all of these the most important feature is a vast hall for beds for the sick. In the two earliest the hall is vaulted and divided into three aisles by pillars, on either side of which it was possible to place four rows of beds. At Tonnerre the great hall, nearly 60 feet (18 m) wide and 300 feet (90 m) long, was roofed with wooden trusses and had a wooden barrel-vault ceiling. The beds were in little chambers along the sides, open to supervision from a gallery that ran continuously around the side walls immediately below the windowsills.
