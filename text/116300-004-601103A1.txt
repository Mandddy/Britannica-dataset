Kensington Palace, royal palace in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Its grounds border the extensive Kensington Gardens to the east.
The palace was originally built for Sir George Coppin in the 17th century, and it became known as Nottingham House after it was purchased by an earl of Nottingham. Sir Christopher Wren was commissioned by William III to oversee its enlargement from 1689, and thereafter it became a principal royal residence.
