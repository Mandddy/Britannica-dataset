La Plata River, Spanish Río De La Plata,  river in east-central Puerto Rico, rising on the western slope of Mount Santa (2,963 feet [903 metres]), a peak of the Sierra de Cayey. Part of the stream is impounded by Lake Carite; the reservoir’s outlet diverts waters for a series of hydroelectric stations on the Guamaní River in the coastal Guayama area to the south. The La Plata itself flows about 46 miles (75 km) northwest and north, dropping from 1,300 feet (400 metres) to less than 500 feet (150 metres), past Comerío and onto the northern coastal plain. The river then flows past the towns of Toa Alta and Toa Baja and empties into the Atlantic Ocean just north of Dorado, a small industrial town west of San Juan, the capital. Along its narrow alluvial plain and terraces, tobacco, grapefruit, and vegetables are grown.
