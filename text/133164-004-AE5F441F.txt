A. Lawrence Lowell, in full Abbott Lawrence Lowell  (born Dec. 13, 1856, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died Jan. 6, 1943, Boston) American lawyer and educator, president of Harvard University from 1909 to 1933, who led the university in significant academic growth.
A member of a prominent Boston family, Lowell was the brother of the astronomer Percival Lowell and of the poet Amy Lowell. He graduated from Harvard (A.B. 1877, LL.B. 1880) and practiced law in Boston for 17 years before turning to teaching at Harvard. In 1909 he succeeded Charles William Eliot as president. Within a few years he modified Eliot’s “free elective” system; devised general examinations to offset the effect of fragmented, isolated courses; and set up a tutorial plan to supplement undergraduate lectures. During his administration student enrollment more than doubled, the faculty nearly trebled, endowments increased from $22 million to $130 million, and new professional schools of architecture, business administration, education, and public health were added. Beginning in 1930 he reorganized the Harvard undergraduate body of about 3,200 students into seven separate, self-contained residential houses. His influence on American education in general is typified by Conflicts of Principle (1932; rev. ed., 1956) and At War with Academic Tradition in America (1934).
