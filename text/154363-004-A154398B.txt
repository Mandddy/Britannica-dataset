Stefano Pilati,  (born December 10, 1965, Milan, Italy) Italian fashion designer who was creative director (2004–12) at the storied house Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) and head of design (2013– ) at Ermenegildo Zegna.
As an unhappy youth pursuing a career as a land surveyor, Pilati found fulfillment in sketching clothing designs for his two sisters, gaining inspiration from their fashion magazines. At age 17 he became an apprentice to designer Nino Cerruti, and he later found employment at an Italian velvet manufacturer. From 1993 to 1995 he served as Giorgio Armani’s menswear assistant before joining the Prada Group (1995) as the head of research and development. In 1998 Pilati was promoted to assistant designer for Miu Miu’s men’s and women’s collections. He moved in 2000 to YSL (a subsidiary of Gucci, which was owned by conglomerate PPR) as design director under Tom Ford. Four years later, following Ford’s failed contract negotiations, Pilati replaced him—with the blessing of Yves Saint Laurent himself—as creative director of YSL’s ready-to-wear line, Rive Gauche.
