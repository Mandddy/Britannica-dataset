Lomariopsidaceae, family of ferns, containing 4 genera and 70 species, in the division Pteridophyta (the lower vascular plants). Members of Lomariopsidaceae are distributed in tropical regions of both the Old and the New World, with very few species extending into the temperate zone. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with different species being terrestrial, growing on rocks and cliffs, climbing up tree trunks, or being totally epiphytic. Leaf morphology is quite variable but most commonly dimorphic, with the sporangia usually naked and nearly entirely covering the undersurface of the fertile leaves. The spores are bean-shaped (bilateral). Lomariopsidaceae is considered a relatively advanced family of ferns.
