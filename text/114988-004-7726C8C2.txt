Cornwall, unitary authority and historic county, southwestern England, occupying a peninsula jutting into the Atlantic Ocean. Truro is the unitary authority’s administrative centre. The unitary authority covers nearly the same area as the historic county. However, the unitary authority includes an area extending west from Werrington along the River Otter that lies within the historic county of Devon, and it does not include the Isles of Scilly, in the Atlantic Ocean, which are part of the historic county of Cornwall but administratively are a unitary authority unto themselves.
Cornwall is the most remote of English counties. Its eastern boundary, on the River Tamar, is some 200 miles (320 km) distant from London. Cornwall’s westernmost town, Penzance, lies another 80 miles (130 km) farther from London and close by Land’s End, the traditional southwestern extreme of Great Britain. The Isles of Scilly lie an additional 35 miles (56 km) southwest of Penzance in the Atlantic Ocean. From 1974 until 2009 Cornwall was an administrative county that comprised six districts, which, except for the largest, North Cornwall, revived traditional Cornish names—Caradon, Carrick, Kerrier, Penwith, and the borough of Restormel—that were unfamiliar to some English ears, though not to Cornishmen, for whom crossing the Tamar was to enter England. An administrative reorganization in April 2009 eliminated the districts and transformed the administrative county into a unitary authority.
