Lick Observatory, astronomical observatory located about 21 km (13 miles) east of San Jose, California, U.S., atop Mount Hamilton. It was the first major mountaintop observatory built in the United States and the world’s first permanently occupied mountaintop observatory.
Building on Mount Hamilton began in 1880 with funds bequeathed four years earlier by a wealthy Californian, James Lick. The observatory’s first major telescope, a 91-cm (36-inch) refractor with optics by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, went into use in 1888 and remained the largest in the world until the completion of the 102-cm (40-inch) refractor at Yerkes Observatory in 1897. (At James Lick’s request, his remains were interred under the support pier of the refractor when it was installed.) In 1895 the observatory acquired a 91-cm reflecting telescope built by Andrew Common in England and owned by Edward Crossley. In the 1930s its mirror was one of the first large mirrors to be aluminized, providing photographic access to the near-ultraviolet region of the spectrum; in the 1960s the Crossley reflector served as a valuable test bed for developing new techniques in spectrophotometry.
