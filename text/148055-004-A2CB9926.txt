Stratification,  the layering that occurs in most sedimentary rocks and in those igneous rocks formed at the Earthâ€™s surface, as from lava flows and volcanic fragmental deposits. The layers range from several millimetres to many metres in thickness and vary greatly in shape. Strata may range from thin sheets that cover many square kilometres to thick lenslike bodies that extend only a few metres laterally.
Planes of parting, or separation between individual rock layers, are termed stratification planes. They are horizontal where sediments are deposited as flat-lying layers, and they exhibit inclination where the depositional site was a sloping surface. The bottom surface of a stratum roughly conforms to irregularities of the underlying surface; the stratification plane above the stratum, however, tends to be nearly horizontal.
