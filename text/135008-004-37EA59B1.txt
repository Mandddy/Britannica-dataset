Saint Nuno Álvares Pereira, also called Saint Nuno of Saint Mary, Nuno Álvares also spelled Nun’álvares   (born June 24, 1360, Bonjardim, Portugal—died April 1, 1431, Lisbon; canonized April 26, 2009; feast day November 6) outstanding Portuguese military leader, known also as the Holy Constable, whose victory over Castilian forces in the historic Battle of Aljubarrota (August 14, 1385) ensured his nation’s independence.
Pereira distinguished himself in battle at age 13, fighting against the Castilians in their invasion of 1373. On the death of Ferdinand I of Portugal (October 1383), Pereira came forward as a supporter of João of Aviz (later John I, king of Portugal), the illegitimate son of Ferdinand’s father, Peter I, against the claims of Ferdinand’s daughter Beatriz, whose marriage to John I of Castile posed a threat to Portugal’s independence. In January 1384 John I invaded Portugal. Despite the fact that most of his family favoured Castile, Pereira continued to support João and defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Atoleiros (April 6, 1384). Further brilliant and heroic actions as a field commander won him the office of constable of the kingdom in 1385.
