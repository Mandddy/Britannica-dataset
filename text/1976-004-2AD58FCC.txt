Charles Lamb,  (born Feb. 10, 1775, London, Eng.—died  Dec. 27, 1834, Edmonton, Middlesex) English essayist and critic, best known for his Essays of Elia (1823–33).
Lamb went to school at Christ’s Hospital, where he studied until 1789. He was a near contemporary there of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and of Leigh Hunt. In 1792 Lamb found employment as a clerk at East India House (the headquarters of the East India Company), remaining there until retirement in 1825. In 1796 Lamb’s sister, Mary, in a fit of madness (which was to prove recurrent) killed their mother. Lamb reacted with courage and loyalty, taking on himself the burden of looking after Mary.
