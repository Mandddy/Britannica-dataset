Realgar,  an important ore of arsenic, a red or orange mineral containing both arsenic and sulfur. Typically it is a minor constituent of ore veins in association with orpiment (into which it disintegrates on long exposure to light). Realgar has been used by the Chinese for carvings, but these also deteriorate under light. It forms prismatic crystals of monoclinic symmetry. For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
