The Big Clock, American film noir, released in 1948, that was a classic of the genre. It was noted for its unexpected plot twists and strong performances, especially those by Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester.
Earl Janoth (played by Laughton) is a tyrannical publishing magnate who murders his mistress and then insinuates that one of his employees, George Stroud (Ray Milland), is the actual culprit. Stroud—a star reporter for Laughton’s crime magazine who has built his reputation on solving high-profile cases—begins investigating the murder. However, the more light he sheds on the case, the more he implicates himself.
