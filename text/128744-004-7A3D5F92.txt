Jörg Haider,  (born Jan. 26, 1950, Bad Goisern, Austria—died Oct. 11, 2008, near Klagenfurt) controversial Austrian politician who served as leader of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (1986–2000) and Alliance for the Future of Austria (2005–08) and as governor of the Bundesland (federal state) of Kärnten (1989–91; 1999–2008).
Haider studied at the University of Vienna, where he received a law degree in 1973 and subsequently taught law. As a student, he became chairman of the youth organization of the Freedom Party of Austria (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs; FPÖ). He later was elected secretary of the party in Kärnten (Carinthia). In 1979, at age 29, he was elected to the national parliament. In 1983 Haider was chosen to be chairman of the FPÖ in Kärnten; in 1986 he became chairman of the federal party. The charismatic Haider transformed the party, increasing its popular appeal. Prior to his leadership, it had performed poorly, while the country’s two main parties, the Social Democratic Party of Austria (Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs; SPÖ) and the conservative Austrian People’s Party (Österreichische Volkspartei; ÖVP), had dominated at both state and federal levels. Following state elections in 1989, however, the FPÖ finished second to the SPÖ and formed a coalition with the ÖVP, enabling Haider’s election as governor of Kärnten. But in 1991, partly as a result of Haider’s praise for the employment policies of Adolf Hitler, the coalition dissolved, and he was forced to resign.
