Al-Ṭayyib Ṣāliḥ,  (born 1929, Al-Shamalīyah province, Sudan—died Feb. 18, 2009, London, Eng.) Arabic-language novelist and short-story writer whose works explore the intersections of traditional and modern life in Africa.
Ṣāliḥ attended universities in the Sudan (in Khartoum) and in London and devoted much of his professional life to radio broadcasting, for many years as head of drama for the BBC Arabic Service. Coming from a rural background of small farmers and orthodox religious teachers, he attempted in his work to harmonize the traditions of the past with the worldliness of the “traveled man,” the African who has returned from schooling abroad. His novel Mawsim al-hijrah ilā al-shamāl (1966; Season of Migration to the North) is a prose poem that reflects the conflicts of modern Africa: traditions and common sense versus education, rural versus urban, men versus women, and the specific versus the universal. Ṣāliḥ’s prose is polyrhythmic and haunting.
