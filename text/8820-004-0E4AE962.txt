Victoria,  French carriage, named for Queen Victoria at least by 1844, and renowned for its elegance. It was first imported into England by the Prince of Wales in 1869, where it rapidly gained popularity. It was usually pulled by one or two horses.
The victoria was a low, light, four-wheeled, doorless vehicle with a forward-facing seat for two persons covered with a folding top, or calash, and a removable, elevated coachman’s seat above the front axle. The graceful body curved down from the coachman’s seat to the floorboards, and up again like a gently sloping chair. Panel-boot victorias were, confusingly, also known as cabriolets. The Grand Victoria had a rumble seat for two extra passengers, and the Victoria-Hansom was an improved hansom cab with a collapsible hood.
