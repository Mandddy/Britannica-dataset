Laxative, any drug used in the treatment of constipation to promote the evacuation of feces. Laxatives produce their effect by several mechanisms. The four main types of laxatives include: saline purgatives, fecal softeners, contact purgatives, and bulk laxatives.
Saline purgatives are salts containing highly charged ions that do not readily cross cell membranes and therefore remain inside the lumen, or passageway, of the bowel. By retaining water through osmotic forces, saline purgatives increase the volume of the contents of the bowel, stretching the colon and producing a normal stimulus for contraction of the muscle, which leads to defecation. Some commonly used salts are magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia), sodium sulfate (Glauber salt), and potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle salt or Seidlitz powder).
