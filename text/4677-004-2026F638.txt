Tire, also spelled tyre,  a continuous band that encircles the rim of a wheel and forms a tread that rolls on either a road, a prepared track, or the ground.
There are two main types of tires, those made of metal and those made of rubber. Railroad cars, which run on smooth steel rails, use iron or steel tires for low rolling resistance. The metal tire is basically a flat hoop fitted tightly over the exterior of the wheel. Besides low rolling resistance, its other attributes are strength, durability, and resistance to wear.
