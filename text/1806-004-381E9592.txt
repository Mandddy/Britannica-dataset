Decathlon, athletic competition lasting two consecutive days in which contestants take part in 10 track-and-field events. It was introduced as a three-day event at the Olympic Games in 1912. Decathlon events are: (first day) 100-metre dash, running long (broad) jump, shot put, high jump, and 400-metre run; (second day) 110-metre hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw, and 1,500-metre run. Competitors are scored for their performance in each event according to a table established by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The table has been changed periodically to keep pace with improvements in world records. The first one was used from 1912 to 1936, while the decathlon was still a three-day event; a second from 1936 to 1950 (with minor revisions in 1952); and a third from 1952 to 1964. All emphasized excellent performances in the individual events. A fourth table in use from 1964 to 1985 and a fifth introduced in 1985 favoured the athlete who could score evenly in all 10 events.
