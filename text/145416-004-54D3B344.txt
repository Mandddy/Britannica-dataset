Chariot racing,  in the ancient world, a popular form of contest between small, two-wheeled vehicles drawn by two-, four-, or six-horse teams. The earliest account of a chariot race occurs in Homerâ€™s description of the funeral of Patroclus (Iliad, book xxiii). Such races were a prominent feature of the ancient Olympic Games and other games associated with Greek religious festivals. They were the main events of the Roman public games (ludi publici) that took place at the Circus Maximus.
From four to six chariots competed in a single race, normally consisting of seven laps around the circus. The racing chariots were light, fragile affairs, easily smashed in a collision, in which case the driver was often entangled in the long reins and dragged to death or seriously injured.
