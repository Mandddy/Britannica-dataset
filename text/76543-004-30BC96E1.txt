Boris III,  (born Jan. 30, 1894, Sofia, Bulg.—died Aug. 28, 1943, Sofia) king of Bulgaria from 1918 to 1943, who, during the last five years of his reign, headed a thinly veiled royal dictatorship.
The son of Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and Maria Luisa of Bourbon-Parma, Boris, despite his Roman Catholic parentage, was brought up in the Orthodox faith for political and dynastic reasons. He succeeded his father as king of Bulgaria when Ferdinand abdicated on Oct. 4, 1918. An opponent of Bulgaria’s dictatorial prime minister, the Agrarian Union leader Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, Boris is generally considered to have played some role in the coup that removed Stamboliyski from power in June 1923. During the following years he was the object of terrorist conspiracies inspired by the Comintern; two attempts were made on his life within a few days in April 1925 by the communists and by Marxist-oriented Agrarians. In the second assassination attempt a cathedral in Sofia was bombed, killing hundreds of people at a funeral service. Boris’s marriage to Princess Giovanna of Italy (1930) temporarily cemented Bulgarian-Italian relations, but during the late 1930s he passed more into the German orbit and sought rapprochement with Yugoslavia. After the establishment of a military dictatorship in Bulgaria (1934) by the authoritarian Zveno Group, Boris worked to remove it and gradually reassert his power; by November 1935 he had successfully installed Georgi Kyoseivanov, a diplomat and personal favourite, as prime minister. From 1938 until his death Boris was dictator in all but name.
