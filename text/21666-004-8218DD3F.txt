Julia Child, née Julia Carolyn McWilliams  (born August 15, 1912, Pasadena, California, U.S.—died August 13, 2004, Santa Barbara) American cooking expert, author, and television personality noted for her promotion of traditional French cuisine.
The daughter of a prosperous financier and consultant, McWilliams graduated from Smith College (B.A., 1934) and worked occasionally in advertising. During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, she performed clerical work in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and China for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency), where she met Paul Cushing Child, whom she married in 1945. During the Childs’ six-year postwar stay in Paris, she attended the Cordon Bleu cooking school for six months and studied privately with master chef Max Bugnard. She and two French friends, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, in 1951 founded L’École des Trois Gourmandes (“The School of the Three Gourmands”) and later wrote the best-selling cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking, 2 vol. (1961, 1970), which was praised for its clarity and comprehensiveness. Her culinary crusade was stated plainly in her introduction:This is a book for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children’s meals, the parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to eat.
