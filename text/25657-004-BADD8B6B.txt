Hans Poelzig,  (born April 30, 1869, Berlin—died  June 14, 1936, Berlin) German architect who is remembered for his Grosses Schauspielhaus (1919), an auditorium in Berlin that was one of the finest architectural examples of German Expressionism.
Poelzig taught at the Breslau Art Academy (1900–16) and the Technical Academy in Berlin (1920–35). His Luban Chemical Factory, situated near Posen, and office building at Breslau (both 1911–12) contained novel elements, but nothing suggesting the imagination evident in his Grosses Schauspielhaus. This structure, a rebuilding of the Schumann Circus, had as its most notable feature an interior lined with stalactite shapes that, particularly under changing lighting conditions, created a grottolike atmosphere. The theatre was demolished in 1988. Poelzig’s later works, especially the administrative building of I.G. Farben in Frankfurt am Main (1930), are monumental in design and have a classical flavour.
