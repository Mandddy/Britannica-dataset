Edward J. Smith, in full Edward John Smith  (born January 27, 1850, Hanley [now in Stoke-on-Trent], Staffordshire, England—died April 15, 1912, at sea, northern Atlantic Ocean) British captain of the passenger liner Titanic, which sank in 1912.
Smith began working on boats while he was a teenager. In 1875 he earned a master’s certificate, which was required to serve as captain. In 1880 he became a junior officer with the White Star Line, and seven years later he commanded his first ship. Smith subsequently helmed numerous vessels while also enduring a series of mishaps. On several occasions his ships ran aground, and in 1911 he was captain of the Olympic when it collided with the British cruiser Hawke off the Isle of Wight; both ships suffered extensive damage. However, Smith was well liked by both crew members and passengers—he earned the nickname the “Millionaire’s Captain” for his popularity with wealthy travelers—and he became White Star’s senior captain. In 1912 he left command of the Olympic to helm the Titanic on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City in April.
