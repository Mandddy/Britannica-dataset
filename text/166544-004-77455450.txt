Chlamydia, a genus of bacterial parasites that cause several different diseases in humans. The genus is composed of three species: C. psittaci, which causes psittacosis; Chlamydia trachomatis, various strains of which cause chlamydia, trachoma, lymphogranuloma venereum, and conjunctivitis; and C. pneumoniae, which causes respiratory-tract infections.
Sexually transmitted disease caused by C. trachomatis is characterized primarily by nongonococcal urethritis (infection of the urethra) in males and females and epididymitis (infection of the epididymus) in males. In men, nongonococcal urethritis has symptoms similar to those of gonorrhea. A gonorrhea-like discharge from the penis is the most prominent symptom. Painful urination may occur but is usually less prominent than with gonorrhea. The symptoms of nongonococcal urethritis appear one to four weeks after the infection has been contracted through sexual intercourse.
