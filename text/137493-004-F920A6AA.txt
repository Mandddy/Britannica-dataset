American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also called the Stimulus,  legislation, enacted by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by Pres. Barack Obama in 2009, that was designed to stimulate the U.S. economy by saving jobs jeopardized by the Great Recession of 2008–09 and creating new jobs.
In December 2007 the U.S. economy officially slipped into recession, spurred particularly by the decline in the housing market and the subprime mortgage crisis and worsened by the collapse of the global financial services firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. (The U.S. economic meltdown hastened in the midst of the 2008 presidential election, and Obama’s steady response to the crisis was cited as a factor in solidifying his election victory in November.) In October 2007 the Dow Jones Industrial Average was over 14,000, but a year later it had shed nearly half its value. As financial markets tumbled around the world, consumer confidence sank, and firms began to lay off workers. By late 2008 the U.S. economy was losing more than 600,000 jobs each month, a trend that carried into Obama’s term as president. The country’s unemployment rate jumped from 5 percent at the beginning of the recession to 7.8 percent by the time Obama was inaugurated in January 2009; it would peak at 10.1 percent in October 2009. During the recession the U.S. economy suffered its most dismal two-quarter period in more than 60 years: gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 6.3 percent in late 2008 and by 5.7 percent in early 2009.
