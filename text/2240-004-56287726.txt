Alexander Mackenzie,  (born Jan. 28, 1822, Logierait, Perthshire, Scot.—died  April 17, 1892, Toronto) Scottish-born politician, the first Liberal prime minister of Canada (1873–78).
Mackenzie emigrated in 1842 from Scotland to Canada West (now Ontario), where he worked as a stone mason and established himself as a building contractor at Sarnia. His interest in reform led to his becoming editor in 1852 of the Lambton Shield, a local Liberal newspaper. He became friendly with George Brown, editor of The Globe (Toronto) and leader of the Reform Party. Mackenzie supported the confederation movement. After the Dominion of Canada was created in 1867, he was elected by Lambton to the dominion’s first House of Commons, in which he effectively led the Liberal opposition. When dual representation was abolished in 1872, he gave up his post as provincial treasurer in the Ontario provincial government.
