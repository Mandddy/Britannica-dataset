Friedrich Rückert, pseudonym Freimund Raimar   (born May 16, 1788, Schweinfurt, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha—died  Jan. 31, 1866, Neuses, near Coburg) prolific German poet known for his facility with many different verse forms.
Rückert studied at Würzburg and Heidelberg and qualified for, but withdrew from, an academic career. A gifted linguist, he was self-educated in Oriental languages and, through translations and imitations of Eastern literature, introduced his German readers to Arabic, Persian, Indian, and Chinese mythology and verse. He taught Oriental philology from 1826 at Erlangen and Berlin universities before moving in 1848 to Neuses to devote his life to scholarship and writing. He published several epic poems and historical plays but achieved greater success and repute with his lyric verse, particularly Liebesfrühling (1844; “Dawn of Love”), poems written during his courtship of Luise Wiethaus, whom he married in 1821. One of his best known works is a martial poem, Geharnischte Sonette (published in Deutsche Gedichte,1814; “Armoured Sonnets”), a stirring exhortation to Prussians to join in the Wars of Liberation (1813–15) from Napoleonic domination; Rückert stayed home during the war at his parents’ request. Kindertotenlieder (“Songs on the Deaths of Children”), written in 1834 on the death of his two children and published posthumously in 1872, were set to music as a song cycle by Gustav Mahler in 1902.
