Eucratides, also spelled Eukratides  (flourished middle of the 2nd century bce) the last important king of Greek Bactria.
Called “the Great” on the coins he minted, Eucratides probably came to power in a coup. Much of his reign was spent in wars against pretenders to the throne and neighbouring rulers. “Demetrius, king of the Indians,” an heir of Euthydemus I, besieged him for five months, but Eucratides escaped and eventually triumphed. Near the end of his reign, he invaded and conquered Paropamisadae and Gandhara in northwest India. While returning home, he was assassinated and his body desecrated by a son, perhaps Plato Epiphanes (“God Manifest”), the rarity of whose coins indicates a brief reign. There is only numismatic evidence for Eucratides II Soter (“the Savior”). Another son, Heliocles Dikaios (“the Just”), may have won his cognomen by avenging his father. Heliocles was the last Greek king to rule north of the Hindu Kush. After his death, Greek Bactria fell to nomadic assaults and the growing Parthian empire.
