Ladybug (family Coccinellidae), also called ladybird beetle,  any of approximately 5,000 widely distributed species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) whose name originated in the Middle Ages, when the beetle was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and called “beetle of Our Lady.”
Ladybird beetles are hemispheric in shape and usually 8 to 10 mm (0.3 to 0.4 inch) long. They have short legs and are usually brightly coloured with black, yellow, or reddish markings. The colour of the wing covers and number of spots vary among species. The pattern of the nine-spotted ladybird beetle (Coccinella novemnotata), which has four black spots on each reddish orange wing cover (elytron) and one shared spot, is an example of the typical colour pattern of ladybird beetles.
