Jean d’Orléans, comte de Dunois, byname the Bastard of Orleans, French Le Bâtard d’Orléans  (born 1403, Paris, France—died November 24, 1468, L’Haÿ-les-Roses) French military commander and diplomat, important in France’s final victory over England in the Hundred Years’ War.
Jean was the natural son of Louis, duc d’Orléans, by his liaison with Mariette d’Enghien. Jean entered the service of his cousin the dauphin, the future Charles VII, in 1420 and became his trusted adviser; he was later appointed grand chamberlain. His first notable success was the defeat of the English at Montargis (1427), and during 1427–28 he defended Orléans until Joan of Arc arrived. He then took part in the Battle of Patay and accompanied Charles to Reims for his coronation. He captured Chartres and Lagny in 1432 and engaged in a series of campaigns culminating in a triumphal entry into Paris in 1436.
