Sir Ben Kingsley, original name Krishna Bhanji  (born December 31, 1943, Scarborough, Yorkshire, England) British actor recognized for playing a wide range of roles, including that of the title character in Gandhi (1982), for which he won an Academy Award for best actor.
Kingsley, of English and Indian descent, first began acting in amateur theatrical productions in Manchester, England. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1967 and debuted on Broadway with the company in 1971. During the remainder of the 1970s, Kingsley acted in plays, most notably Hamlet. Although he made his film debut in 1973 in Fear Is the Key, Kingsley did not return to cinema until he was cast as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in the early 1980s. To prepare for the role of the legendary Indian leader, he did extensive research, including adopting Gandhi’s habits of practicing yoga and eating a vegetarian diet. Critics noted his strong resemblance to Gandhi in the film, and the performance remains one of Kingsley’s most acclaimed characterizations.
