Alain Resnais,  (born June 3, 1922, Vannes, France—died March 1, 2014, Paris) French motion-picture director, a leader of the Nouvelle Vague (New Wave) of unorthodox, influential film directors appearing in France in the late 1950s. His major works include Hiroshima mon amour (1959) and L’Année dernière à Marienbad (1961; Last Year at Marienbad).
Resnais was the son of a well-to-do pharmacist. A victim of chronic asthma, he spent a solitary childhood marked by intense interest in creative activity, characteristics that would remain salient through his adult life. While still a boy, he was given a movie camera, and at age 14 he directed his classmates in a film version of a popular thriller, Fantômas.
