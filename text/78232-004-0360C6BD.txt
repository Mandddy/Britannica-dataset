Miranda, innermost and smallest of the five major moons of Uranus and, topographically, the most varied of the group. It was discovered in telescopic photographs of the Uranian system in 1948 by the Dutch American astronomer Gerard P. Kuiper, who named it after a character in William Shakespeare’s play The Tempest.
Miranda revolves around Uranus once every 1.413 days in a nearly circular orbit at a mean distance of 129,800 km (80,654 miles) from the centre of the planet. Slightly nonspherical in shape, it has a mean diameter of about 470 km (290 miles). Miranda’s density of 1.2 grams per cubic cm, which is somewhat less than those of the other major Uranian moons, suggests that it has a greater proportion of water ice to rocky material and other ices than these other bodies.
