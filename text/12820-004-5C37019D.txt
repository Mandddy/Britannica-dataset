Clionid, any member of the sponge family Clionidae (class Demospongiae, phylum Porifera), noted for its ability to dissolve and bore into calcium-containing substances, such as limestone, coral, and mollusk shells. Clionid sponges occur in all oceans. The microscopic clionid larva attaches itself onto a calcium-containing substratum and metamorphoses into an adult as it bores galleries.
Clionids are ecologically important, for they destroy seashells that would otherwise accumulate on the ocean floor. Cliona sulphurea, common in coastal waters from New England to South Carolina, is bright yellow and lives on the shells of both dead and living mollusks.
