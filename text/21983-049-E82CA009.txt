Iguana, any of eight genera and roughly 30 species of the larger members of the lizard family Iguanidae. The name iguana usually refers only to the members of the subfamily Iguaninae. The best-known species is the common, or green, iguana (Iguana iguana), which occurs from Mexico southward to Brazil. Males of this species reach a maximum length of over 2 metres (6.6 feet) and 6 kg (13.2 pounds). It is often seen basking in the sun on the branches of trees overhanging water, into which it will plunge if disturbed. The common iguana is green with dark bands that form rings on the tail; females are grayish green and about half the weight of males. Iguanas also possess atrophied venom glands that produce a weak harmless venom.
Food of the common iguana consists largely of leaves, buds, flowers, and fruits of fig trees (genus Ficus), although many other trees are also fed upon. Whereas this lizard has a well-developed digestive system housing bacteria that ferment plant material, it also eats invertebrates when young and has been known to eat small birds and mammals.
