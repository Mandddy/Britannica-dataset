Candide, satirical novel published in 1759 that is the best-known work by Voltaire. It is a savage denunciation of metaphysical optimism—as espoused by the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz—that reveals a world of horrors and folly.
In this philosophical fantasy, naive Candide sees and suffers such misfortune that he ultimately rejects the philosophy of his tutor Doctor Pangloss, who claims that “all is for the best in this best of all possible worlds.” Candide and his companions—Pangloss, his beloved Cunégonde, and his servant Cacambo—display an instinct for survival that gives them hope in an otherwise sombre setting. When they all retire together to a simple life on a small farm, they discover that the secret of happiness is “to cultivate one’s garden,” a practical philosophy that excludes excessive idealism and nebulous metaphysics.
