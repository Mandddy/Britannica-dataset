Jump rope, also called skip rope ,  children’s game played by individuals or teams with a piece of rope, which may have handles attached at each end. Jump rope, which dates back to the 19th century, is traditionally a girls’ playground or sidewalk activity in which two players turn a rope (holding it by its ends and swinging it in a circle) and the other players take turns jumping it while chanting a rhyme or counting. When it is played as a game, each player is required to move in while the rope is turning, complete the jump, and move out without contacting or stopping the rope; the jumps required usually become more complicated as the game proceeds.
There are many types of jumps, including single, double, backward, crossed-feet, hot pepper (twice as fast as usual), quarter turns, half turns, full turns, and two-at-a-time (jumpers); in double Dutch, two ropes (or one long rope such as a clothesline that has been doubled) are turned simultaneously in opposite directions; in criss-cross, performed by one person holding both ends of the rope, the arms are crossed back and forth on alternate turns of the rope.
