Sir Jonathan Ive,  (born February 1967, London, England) British industrial designer and Apple Inc. executive who was responsible for making design as integral to the appeal of a personal computer as its power and speed.
Ive studied art and design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University). After graduating in 1989, he cofounded Tangerine, a London-based design consultancy that counted Apple among its clients. In 1992 Apple offered Ive a full-time position at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. He accepted, but it was not until Apple cofounder Steve Jobs returned to the troubled company as CEO in 1997 that the real impact of Iveâ€™s design ethos began to be felt.
