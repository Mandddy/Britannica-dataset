Michele Bachmann, née Michele Marie Amble  (born April 6, 1956, Waterloo, Iowa, U.S.) American politician who served as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (2007–15). She sought the Republican nomination for president in 2012.
Michele Amble spent her young childhood in Iowa, but as an adolescent she moved with her family to the northern suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Shortly thereafter her parents divorced, and she and her siblings were raised by their mother. Amble attended Winona State University in Minnesota (B.A., 1978), where she studied political science and English. While in college she volunteered for Jimmy Carter’s 1976 presidential campaign. After Carter’s election, however, she became disenchanted with the Democratic Party, in part because of her evolving opposition to abortion. Several months after graduation, she married classmate Marcus Bachmann.
