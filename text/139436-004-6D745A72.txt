Continental margin, the submarine edge of the continental crust distinguished by relatively light and isostatically high-floating material in comparison with the adjacent oceanic crust. It is the name for the collective area that encompasses the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise. The characteristics of the various continental margins are shaped by a number of factors. Chief among these are tectonics, fluctuations of sea level, the size of the rivers that empty onto a margin as determined by the amount of sediment they carry, and the energy conditions or strength of the ocean waves and currents along the margin.
Continental margins on the leading edges of tectonic plates, like those around the rim of the Pacific Ocean, are usually narrow and have steep continental slopes and either poorly developed continental rises or none at all. The continental slope is often steep and falls away directly into a deep-sea trench. In many cases, the leading-edge margins are backed by mountain ranges. Continental margins on the trailing side of tectonic plates, like those around the Atlantic Ocean, are broad, with gentle continental slopes and well-developed continental rises. The adjacent land area is commonly a broad coastal plain that, depending on the state of sea level, may become submerged from time to time and hence part of the continental margin.
