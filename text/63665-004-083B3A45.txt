Lungless salamander (family Plethodontidae), any of more than 370 species of lungless amphibians dependent largely on cutaneous respiration (gas exchange through moistened skin). Plethodontidae is the largest group of salamanders, and its members occur predominantly in the Americas from southern Canada to the Amazon basin in Brazil. A few species also occur spottily in Sardinia, northern Italy, and the Korean peninsula. Adult plethodontids range in size from approximately 25 mm (1 inch) in head and body length in the Mexican pygmy salamander (Thorius) to 36 cm (14 inches) in Bell’s false brook salamander (Pseudoeurycea bellii). The length of the animal’s tail usually equals or slightly exceeds its head and body length. Most plethodontid species are between 40 and 120 mm (1.6 and 4.7 inches) in head and body length. Since they lack lungs, all plethodontids breathe through their skin and the mucous membrane in the mouth and throat; these surfaces must remain moist at all times in order to absorb oxygen.
All lungless salamanders possess a pair of nasolabial grooves, and each groove extends from the upper lip to a nostril. The salamander touches its snout to a surface (nose tapping), and capillary action moves odour particles up the groove into the sensory cells in the vomeronasal organ of the nose. Plethodontids rely on odours for chemical alarm cues, directions to food sources, and cues for courtship and other social behaviour. Smaller species eat a wide variety of small invertebrates that range from worms to insects and mites. Larger plethodontids also consume invertebrates, and some of them even prey on other salamanders.
