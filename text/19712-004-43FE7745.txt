Santiago de Compostela, city, A Coruña provincia (province), capital of the comunidad autonóma (autonomous community) of Galicia, northwestern Spain. It lies near the confluence of the Sar and Sarela rivers, 32 miles (51 km) southwest of A Coruña city. In 1985 UNESCO designated the city a World Heritage site.
In 813 ce a tomb discovered at nearby Padrón was said to have been supernaturally revealed to be that of the apostle St. James, martyred at Jerusalem about 44 ce. His bones had been taken to Spain, where, according to legend, he had formerly evangelized. The discovery of the relics provided a rallying point for Christian Spain, then confined to a narrow strip of the northern Iberian Peninsula (most of the remainder of which was occupied by Moors). Alfonso II of Asturias built a church over the tomb, which Alfonso III replaced by a larger structure, and during the Middle Ages the town that grew up around it became the most important Christian place of pilgrimage after Jerusalem and Rome. The whole town, except the tomb itself, was destroyed in 997 by Abū ʿĀmir al-Manṣūr (Almanzor), military commander of the Moorish caliphate of Córdoba.
