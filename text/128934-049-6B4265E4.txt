United Farm Workers of America (UFW), U.S. labour union founded in 1962 as the National Farm Workers Association by Cesar Chavez, a migrant farm labourer. The union merged with the American Federation of Laborâ€“Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) in 1966 and was re-formed under its current name in 1971 to achieve collective bargaining rights for farmworkers in the United States. In 2006 the UFW disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO and joined the labour federation Change to Win. The UFW seeks to empower migrant farmworkers and improve their wages and working conditions. It also works to espouse nonviolence and to educate members on political and social issues.
