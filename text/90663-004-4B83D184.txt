Tom Mix, byname of Thomas Hezikiah Mix   (born Jan. 6, 1880, Mix Run, Pa., U.S.—died  Oct. 12, 1940, near Florence, Ariz.) American film actor, a celebrated star of western cowboy films during the silent era.
Mix worked as a cowhand in Texas, Arizona, Wyoming, and Montana and served in the U.S. Army in the Spanish-American War and in the pursuit of Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. He was also a deputy sheriff in Oklahoma and served in the Texas Rangers. In 1906 he joined a Wild West show and, three years later, the Sells-Floto Circus. He began to act in motion pictures in 1910, playing the part of a roughriding hero, defender of right and justice. Over the years his horse “Tony” became almost as famous as Mix himself. Mix appeared in more than 200 one- and two-reelers and feature films, many of which he also produced or directed.
