Jean Richepin,  (born Feb. 4, 1849, Médéa, Algeria—died  Dec. 12, 1926, Paris, France) French poet, dramatist, and novelist who examined the lower levels of society in sharp, bold language. As Émile Zola revolutionized the novel with his naturalism, Richepin did the same for French poetry during that period.
The son of a physician, Richepin began the study of medicine but gave it up in order to study literature at the École Normale. He left school without a degree and for a time wandered about France. His first book of poetry, La Chanson des gueux (“Song of the Poor”), was published in 1876. Local authorities responded to its coarse language by sentencing him to a month in prison.
