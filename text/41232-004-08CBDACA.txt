Max Wolf, in full Maximillian Franz Joseph Cornelius Wolf   (born June 21, 1863, Heidelberg, Baden [Germany]â€”died  Oct. 3, 1932, Heidelberg) German astronomer who applied photography to the search for asteroids and discovered 228 of them.
Wolf showed an early interest in astronomy; he was only 21 years old when he discovered a comet, now named for him. In 1890 he was appointed Privatdozent (unsalaried lecturer) at the University of Heidelberg. One year later he adapted a camera to a motor-driven telescope to seek out asteroids. (All previous discoveries had been made one by one by direct observation.) Using a time exposure of the heavens, Wolf demonstrated that the asteroids, because of their orbital motion, would show up in the photograph as a short line rather than a point of light, which denoted a star.
