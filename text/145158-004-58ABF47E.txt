The Family, originally National Committee for Christian Leadership, later called International Christian Leadership, also known as The Fellowship ,  international religious movement that ministers to political and economic elites. It is based on visions that members believe were granted by God to the movement’s founder, Abraham Vereide, and on subsequent refinements by Douglas Coe, Vereide’s successor and the movement’s current head, and other Family leaders. Centred at The Cedars, a mansion in Arlington, Va., it is active throughout the world.
The Family is organized according to a model of the degrees of intimacy that Jesus maintained with different groups of his followers. An inner circle of “apostles,” also known as the Core Group, consisting of Coe and his sons and a small number of political and business leaders, exercises spiritual authority and supervises the movement’s finances. An outer circle of “disciples” constitutes the regular membership of the movement. The public is conceived of as lying outside the outer circle. The Family’s activities, which are conducted through a loose network of nonprofit corporations and prayer meetings, emphasize what it calls “leadership development” among members and the recruitment as disciples of current and future leaders in politics and business.
