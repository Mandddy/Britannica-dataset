Saluki, breed of hound whose ancestors may date to 7000 to 6000 bce. Sacred to the Egyptians, who called it the “royal dog of Egypt,” the saluki was used to hunt gazelles. Graceful, keen-sighted, and generally hardy, it is a slender, greyhoundlike dog with long ears and a silky coat; in one variety the hair is longer on the ears, legs, and tail. Colours include white, pale tan, reddish brown, black-and-tan, and a combination of black, tan, and white. Male salukis stand 23 to 28 inches (58 to 71 cm) and weigh 45 to 60 pounds (20 to 27 kg); females are considerably smaller.
