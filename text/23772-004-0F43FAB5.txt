José Miguel Carrera,  (born October 15/16, 1785, Santiago, Chile—died September 4, 1821, Mendoza, Argentina) aristocratic leader in the early struggle for the independence of Chile and first president of that country.
By a coup d’état in 1811, Carrera placed himself at the head of the national government and later the same year made himself dictator. Soon, however, internecine strife developed in the independence movement that permitted the restoration of Spanish rule. Bernardo O’Higgins was elevated to the leadership of the forces opposing Carrera, who in 1813 was removed from power by the junta in favour of O’Higgins; early in 1814, however, Carrera regained control. During the ensuing invasion of Spanish forces from Peru, both Carrera and O’Higgins were defeated at Rancagua (October 1814). Carrera sought aid against his opponents, first in Buenos Aires and then, in 1815, in the United States. On his return to Argentina in 1816, he was not allowed to continue into Chile, and so he helped Argentine provincial chiefs in sporadic revolts against the government in Buenos Aires. Eventually betrayed by his own men, he was captured and shot.
