Roger Ebert, in full Roger Joseph Ebert, pseudonyms Reinhold Timme and R. Hyde  (born June 18, 1942, Urbana, Illinois, U.S.—died April 4, 2013, Chicago, Illinois) American film critic, perhaps the best known of his profession, who became the first person to receive a Pulitzer Prize for film criticism (1975).
Ebert’s journalism career began at the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette, where he worked as a sportswriter from age 15. He was on the staff and served as editor in chief of The Daily Illini, the newspaper of the University of Illinois. After graduating (B.A. in journalism, 1964), Ebert spent a year studying in Cape Town, South Africa, on a Rotary scholarship and then began graduate study at the University of Chicago. He left after a year to accept a position at the Chicago Sun-Times. In 1967 he was named the paper’s chief film critic, a title he would hold for more than 40 years. Ebert was known for his unabashed love of cinema and an unpretentious, accessible approach that allowed him to give equal critical consideration to both Hollywood blockbusters and art house fare. An acquaintance with director Russ Meyer led Ebert to write several scripts for the camp auteur in the 1970s, including Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970).
