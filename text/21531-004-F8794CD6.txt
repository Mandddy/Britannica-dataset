Sylvia Field Porter, née Sylvia Field Feldman   (born June 18, 1913, Patchogue, Long Island, N.Y., U.S.—died June 5, 1991, Pound Ridge, N.Y.)  American economist and journalist whose financial advice—in newspaper columns, books, and magazines—garnered a wide audience in a field dominated by men.
Porter graduated from Hunter College in New York City in 1932. She worked as an assistant in a Wall Street investment house, and while learning firsthand the intricacies of the market in government bonds she took supplementary courses at the School of Business Administration of New York University. During 1934–35 she published Reporting on Governments, a pioneer weekly newsletter on the government bond market. In 1935 she began contributing a thrice-weekly financial column to the New York Post, and within a short time she was the paper’s regular financial reporter.
