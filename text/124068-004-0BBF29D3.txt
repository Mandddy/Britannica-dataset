Eugenio d’Ors y Rovira,  (born September 28, 1882, Barcelona, Spain—died September 25, 1954, Villanueva y Geltrú) Catalan essayist, philosopher, and art critic who was a leading ideologue of the Catalan cultural renaissance of the early 20th century.
Although d’Ors studied law in Barcelona and earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Madrid, he was by profession a journalist who wrote an influential column (later anthologized) in Catalan called Glossari. When he moved to Madrid in 1920 he continued to write El nuevo glosario (“The New Glossary”) in Castilian. He excelled in a short-essay genre, the glosa. In a column in 1906, he coined the term noucentisme (“1900-ism”) to characterize Catalan culture of the 20th century. He believed that art should be “arbitrary,” or subjectivist, breaking with traditional norms. By extending this concept to the political movement of Catalan nationalism, he was able to characterize a whole program of political and cultural renewal for Catalonia. He wrote Tres horas en el Museo del Prado (1923; “Three Hours in the Prado Museum”) and provided valuable criticisms of the art of Francisco de Goya, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso. He was also a gifted caricaturist, influenced by Aubrey Beardsley.
