Seiji Ozawa,  (born September 1, 1935, Hoten, Manchukuo [now in China]) Japanese American conductor especially noted for his energetic style and his sweeping performances of 19th-century Western symphonic works.
Ozawa showed interest in Western music as a child in Japan and hoped to become a pianist. At age 16 he sustained injuries to his hands and turned to conducting, studying with Hideo Saito at the Toho School in Tokyo. After conducting with the NHK (Nippon Hōsō Kyōkai, or Japan Broadcasting System) Symphony Orchestra of Japan and the Japanese Philharmonic, in 1959 he went to Europe, where he won the Besançon International Conductors’ Competition. During the following summer he studied with Charles Munch at the Berkshire Music Center (now Tanglewood [Massachusetts] Music Center). There he won the Koussevitzky Prize, awarded to the best student conductor.
