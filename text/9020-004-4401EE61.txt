Tiryns,  prehistoric city in the Argolis, Greece, noted for its architectural remains of the Homeric period. Excavations show the area to have been inhabited from the Neolithic Age. Not later than the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, or Early Helladic Period (c. 3000–c. 2200 bc), a pre-Greek agricultural people arrived, probably from western Anatolia, as suggested by place-name endings such as -ssos, -ttos, -inthos, -indos, and -enai. In the Middle Bronze Age, or Middle Helladic Period, people from the north moved in who are believed to have spoken an early variant of the Greek language. In contrast to the violent invasions by these people in other areas, their arrival at Tiryns appeared to have been peaceful. The settlement at Tiryns developed into a centre of the Mycenaean, or Late Helladic, culture, influenced by that of Minoan Crete. Tiryns, situated on a ridge in the plain between Nauplia (modern Návplion) and Mycenae, survived into the classical period but was destroyed by Argos about 468 bc. From the huge stones of the walls of its citadel, supposedly built by the Cyclopes for the legendary king Proteus, the expression Cyclopean masonry is derived.
