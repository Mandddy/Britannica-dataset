Gustave Kahn,  (born Dec. 21, 1859, Metz, France—died  Sept. 5, 1936, Paris) French poet and literary theorist who claimed to be the inventor of vers libre (“free verse”).
After study in Paris, Kahn spent four years in North Africa, returning to Paris in 1885. He helped found or edit several literary reviews, including La Vogue, Le Symboliste, and La Revue Indépendante, which printed his poems and discussed the various theories surrounding the Symbolist movement. Kahn explained his theory of vers libre in the preface to his Premiers poèmes (1897), which included the earlier volumes Les Palais nomades (1887; “The Wandering Palaces”), Chansons d’amant (1891; “A Lover’s Songs”), and Domaine de fée (1895; “Fairy World”). Though it is unclear who developed this verse form, Kahn was undoubtedly its first and most persuasive advocate. He broke with the tradition of the alexandrine line and sought to make rhythm more dependent on the movement of the poem’s thoughts than on traditional rules of prosody. He also wrote a highly personal contribution to the history of French poetry, Symbolistes et décadents (1902).
