Diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), species of moth in the family Yponomeutidae (order Lepidoptera) that is sometimes placed in its own family, Plutellidae. The diamondback moth is small and resembles its close relative, the ermine moth, but holds its antennae forward when at rest. The adult moths have a wingspan of 15 mm (0.6 inch) and wavy yellow radial lines on the forewings, separating the brown anterior area from the cream-coloured hind edge. When the wings are folded these marks form a distinctive series of yellow diamond-shaped marks on top, for which the species is named. Larvae pupate in silk cocoons spun on the leaf surface of various food plants. They can cause considerable destruction of cabbages and allied vegetables (family Brassicaceae) in all parts of the world.
Diamondback moths are controlled primarily through the use of synthetic insecticides (e.g., chlorfluazuron, teflubenzuron). However, their susceptibility to the different chemicals varies greatly, and the insects are capable of rapidly developing resistance to most agents. The diamondback moth was the first insect pest to develop resistance to Bt toxin, a plant-expressed insecticide that occurs in crops genetically modified to carry the Bt-producing gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. Transgenic sexing, in which males are engineered to carry a gene that prevents the maturation and reproduction of female offspring, has been explored as an alternative means of control.
