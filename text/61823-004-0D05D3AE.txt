Claude Rains, in full William Claude Rains  (born Nov. 10, 1889, London, Eng.—died  May 30, 1967, Laconia, N.H., U.S.)  British motion picture and stage character actor noted for his smooth, distinguished voice, polished, ironic style, and intelligent portrayal of a variety of roles, ranging from villains to sympathetic gentlemen.
Rains began acting at the age of 11 and worked at various backstage jobs before making his adult stage debut in 1911. After serving in World War I, he enjoyed a successful stage career in London and taught at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (one of his students was John Gielgud). He toured the United States in The Constant Nymph in 1926 and soon made a name for himself on Broadway. Although neither tall nor romantically handsome, Rains had an attractive, expressive face and a commanding voice and stage presence that led to his making a screen test. He was then cast in the title role of H.G. Wells’s The Invisible Man (1933), directed by James Whale. Although Rains’s face is hidden behind bandages throughout most of the film, his ominous voice effectively reflects the heightening madness of the megalomaniacal scientist he portrays.
