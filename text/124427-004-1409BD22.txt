Saptamatrika, (
        Sanskrit: “Seven Mothers”) in Hinduism, a group of seven mother-goddesses, each of whom is the shakti, or female counterpart, of a god. They are Brahmani (wife of Brahma), Maheshvari (wife of Shiva), Kaumari (wife of Kumara), Vaishnavi (wife of Vishnu), Varahi (wife of Varaha, or the boar, an avatar [incarnation] of Vishnu), Indrani (wife of Indra), and Chamunda, or Yami (wife of Yama). One text, the Varaha-purana, states that they number eight, including Yogeshvari, created out of the flame from Shiva’s mouth.
Representations of the goddesses are found in shrines throughout India, frequently flanked by Virabhadra (a ferocious form of Lord Shiva) on the left and the elephant-headed Ganesha on the right. The individual mothers can be identified by their weapons, ornaments, vahanas (“mounts”), and banner emblems, which are in each case the same as those of their corresponding male deities. Groups devoted to the Saptamatrika may have existed before the 11th century.
