Monroe, county, northwestern New York state, U.S., comprising a lowland region bordered by Lake Ontario to the north. The principal waterways are the Genesee River, which bisects the county north-south; Irondequoit Creek, which empties into Irondequoit Bay; and the New York State Canal System (completed 1918), which incorporates the Erie Canal (1825).

Seneca Indians, members of the Iroquois Confederacy, were early residents of the region. Rochester, the county seat, was known for its flour-milling, textile, and nursery industries in the 19th century. It was home to industrialists John Jacob Bausch and Henry Lomb, founders of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company (now Bausch &amp; Lomb Incorporated) in the mid-1850s. George Eastman, an innovator of photographic equipment, founded the Eastman Kodak Company (1880) and donated generously to the University of Rochester (founded 1850), which includes the Eastman School of Music.
