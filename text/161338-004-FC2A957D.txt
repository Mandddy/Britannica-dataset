Hugh MacLennan,  (born March 20, 1907, Glace Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada—died November 7, 1990, Montreal, Quebec) Canadian novelist and essayist whose books offer an incisive social and psychological critique of modern Canadian life.
A Rhodes scholar at Oxford, MacLennan received a Ph.D. from Princeton (1935) and taught Latin and history at Lower Canada College, Montreal (1935–45). He was professor of English at McGill University (1951–63). MacLennan’s first novel, Barometer Rising (1941), is a moral fable that uses as a background the actual explosion of a munitions ship that partly destroyed the city of Halifax in 1917. His later novels include Two Solitudes (1945), which explores Anglo-French relations in Canada; The Precipice (1948), a study of differences between Canadian and U.S. citizens; and The Watch That Ends the Night (1959), an existentialist study of a man faced with a moral and psychological crisis. Return of the Sphinx (1967) is a political novel about French-Canadian nationalism. His seventh novel, Voices in Time (1980), is the story of a man’s attempt to reconstruct the history of a Canada destroyed by nuclear holocaust.
