Fritz von Unruh,  (born May 10, 1885, Koblenz, Germany—died November 28, 1970, Diez, West Germany) dramatist, poet, and novelist, one of the most poetically gifted of the younger German Expressionist writers.
The son of a general, Unruh was an army officer in active service until 1912, when he resigned his commission to devote his time to writing. His critical reflections on the military establishment in his play Offiziere (“Officers”), staged by Max Reinhardt in 1911, and his antiwar sentiments expressed in the dramatic poem Vor der Entscheidung (1914; “Before the Decision”) are early variations on the two themes basic to his entire work: the nature of the social order into which the individual has to be integrated and the necessity to ground this order not in authority but in the integrity and responsibility of the individual toward humanity. Explorations of these themes through his war experiences—on a metaphysical plane, in his narrative Der Opfergang (written in 1916 at Verdun, published 1919; Way of Sacrifice) and, on a mythical level, in the tragedy Ein Geschlecht (1916; “A Family”)—strengthened his antimilitaristic attitude and led to such later works as Heinrich von Andernach (1925), a festival play and a great plea for love among men.
