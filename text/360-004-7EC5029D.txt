Battle of Nördlingen, (Sept. 5–6, 1634), battle fought near Nördlingen in southern Germany. A crushing victory for the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years’ War, it ended Swedish domination in southern Germany, and it led France to become an active participant in the war.
In the summer of 1634 the Hapsburg imperial army, led by Matthias Gallas, count von Campo, began to regain towns in southern Germany lost to Gustav II Adolf of Sweden and his allies two years earlier. Having taken Regensburg and Donauwörth, they laid siege to Nördlingen. There, a large Spanish army commanded by Ferdinand III, son of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, joined them from Italy. The combined forces prepared a heavily fortified position on a hill south of the town, which the army of Sweden and its Protestant allies, under the combined command of Gustav Karlsson Horn and Bernhard, duke of Saxe-Weimar, attacked. Although the Swedes gained an advantage on the first day of the battle, their forces were outnumbered and poorly led. The next day all attempts to dislodge the Habsburg army failed; some 12,000 Protestants fell, and 4,000 more (including Horn) were captured. Bernhard led the survivors northward, abandoning southern Germany to the victors. It was, claimed Spanish King Philip IV’s chief minister, “the greatest victory of our times.”
