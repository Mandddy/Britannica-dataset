William Rockhill Nelson,  (born March 7, 1841, Fort Wayne, Indiana, U.S.—died April 13, 1915, Kansas City, Missouri) American journalist, editor, and publisher who helped found The Kansas City Star (1880). Among American publishers he was a pioneering advocate of focusing investigative reporting on local municipal corruption instead of merely printing the exposés of nationally famed muckrakers.
Nelson was the headstrong son of a strict Episcopalian father, who sent the boy to Notre Dame College. He was sent home after two years but continued his studies and won admittance to the bar in 1862. Nelson practiced law, made a fortune in road-building contracts, lost much of it, and turned to Democratic Party politics. He managed the Indiana campaign of U.S. presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden in 1876. With Samuel E. Morss, he bought the Fort Wayne Sentinel in 1878. The partners sold that Indiana paper after a year and a half and moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where they founded the Evening Star.
