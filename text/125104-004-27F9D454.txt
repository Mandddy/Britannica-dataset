Canadian River,  river that rises in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, northeastern New Mexico, U.S., and flows southward across the Las Vegas Plains, cutting a gorge nearly 1,500 feet (450 m) deep in the Canadian escarpment before turning eastward. It continues through the Texas Panhandle in a deep, narrow valley cut into reddish sandstones, the walls of which are known locally as the “breaks,” and flows eastward through the Antelope Hills in Oklahoma, past Oklahoma City, to join the Arkansas River 27 miles (47 km) southeast of Muskogee, at the western edge of the Boston Mountains. Through most of its 906-mile (1,458-kilometre) course, the Canadian is a braided stream with an interlacing system of channels; it drains an area of 46,900 square miles (121,500 square km).
Flood-control and irrigation units along its course are Conchas Dam and reservoir (1939), near Tucumcari, N.M.; Ute Reservoir, impounded at Logan, N.M.; and Lake Meredith, impounded by Sanford Dam, near Borger, Texas. The main tributary is the North Canadian, which joins the Canadian from the west, near Eufaula, Okla., there dammed to form Eufaula Reservoir before the combined streams enter the Arkansas. Other tributaries include the Mora River and Ute Creek in New Mexico and Mustang Creek in Texas.
