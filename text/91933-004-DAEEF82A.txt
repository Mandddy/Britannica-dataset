Kilauea, the world’s most active volcanic mass, located on the southeastern part of the island of Hawaii, Hawaii state, U.S. The central feature of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Kilauea (“Much Spreading” in Hawaiian), is an elongated dome built of lava eruptions from a central crater and from lines of craters extending along east and southwest rifts, or fissures. The volcano’s 4,090-foot (1,250-metre) summit has collapsed to form a caldera, a broad shallow depression nearly 3 miles (5 km) long and 2 miles (3.2 km) wide with an area of more than 4 square miles (10 square km). Kilauea’s slopes merge with those of the nearby volcano Mauna Loa on the west and north.
During the 19th century the main floor of Kilauea’s caldera went through several periods of lava filling and collapse. By 1919 it assumed its present depth of 500 feet (150 metres). The floor, paved with recent lava flows, contains the Halema‘uma‘u (“Fern House”) Crater, an inner crater that is Kilauea’s most active vent. Halema‘uma‘u is the legendary home of Pele, the Hawaiian fire goddess. The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is at Uwēkahuna Bluff on the western rim of Kilauea, near Halema‘uma‘u.
