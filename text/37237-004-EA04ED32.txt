Hugh Latimer,  (born c. 1485, Thurcaston, Leicestershire, Eng.—died  Oct. 16, 1555, Oxford) English Protestant who advanced the cause of the Reformation in England through his vigorous preaching and through the inspiration of his martyrdom.
Latimer was the son of a prosperous yeoman farmer. Educated at the University of Cambridge, he was ordained a priest about 1510. In the two decades before 1530 he gradually acquired a reputation as a preacher at Cambridge. At first he subscribed to orthodox Roman Catholicism, but in 1525 he came into contact with a group of young Cambridge divines who were influenced by Martin Luther’s new doctrines. He attributed his conversion to Protestantism to the ministrations of the group’s spiritual leader, Thomas Bilney. After gaining royal favour by speaking out in support of the efforts of King Henry VIII to obtain an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Latimer received the benefice of West Kington, Wiltshire, in 1531. He soon befriended two rising Reformers: Thomas Cromwell, who was to become the king’s chief minister, and the future archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer. Such powerful backers, however, could not protect him from accusations of heretical preachings. Before investigators Latimer refused in January 1532 to subscribe to certain articles of faith such as the existence of purgatory and the need to venerate saints. Consequently, he was excommunicated and imprisoned until he made a complete submission (April 1532).
