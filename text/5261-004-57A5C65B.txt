Whitney M. Young, Jr.,  (born July 31, 1921, Lincoln Ridge, Ky., U.S.—died  March 11, 1971, Lagos, Nigeria) articulate U.S. civil rights leader who spearheaded the drive for equal opportunity for blacks in U.S. industry and government service during his 10 years as head of the National Urban League (1961–71), the world’s largest social-civil rights organization. His advocacy of a “Domestic Marshall Plan”—massive funds to help solve America’s racial problems—was felt to have strongly influenced federal poverty programs sponsored by Democratic Party administrations in Washington (1963–69).
After army service in World War II, Young switched his career interest from medicine to social work, in which he took his M.A. from the University of Minnesota (1947). Starting as director of industrial relations for the Urban League at St. Paul, Minn. (1947–50), he moved to Omaha, Neb., where he served as executive secretary (1950–54). Becoming dean of the School of Social Work of Atlanta (Georgia) University in 1954, he was instrumental in improving relations between city and university.
