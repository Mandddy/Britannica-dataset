Nathaniel Palmer, in full Nathaniel Brown Palmer  (born August 8, 1799, Stonington, Connecticut, U.S.â€”died June 21, 1877, San Francisco, California) American sea captain and explorer after whom Palmer Land, a stretch of western Antarctic coast and islands, is named.
Palmer went to sea at the age of 14. He served first as a sailor on a blockade runner in the War of 1812. He later became a sealer, and his South Sea explorations were largely stimulated by the desire to locate new seal rookeries. Becoming captain of the schooner Galina in 1818, Palmer began explorations of the Cape Horn region and western Antarctic the following year. In 1820 he reported a landfall on the coast of Antarctica, which he called Palmer Land. Whether he was the first person to view Antarctica is controversial because Russian explorer Fabien Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and English explorer Edward Bransfield also claimed to have been the first to sight it in 1820. On these and subsequent voyages Palmer discovered the Gerlache Strait and Orleans Channel in Antarctica as well as the South Orkney Islands.
