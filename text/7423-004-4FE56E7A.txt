Amine, any member of a family of nitrogen-containing organic compounds that is derived, either in principle or in practice, from ammonia (NH3).
Naturally occurring amines include the alkaloids, which are present in certain plants; the catecholamine neurotransmitters (i.e., dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine); and a local chemical mediator, histamine, that occurs in most animal tissues.
