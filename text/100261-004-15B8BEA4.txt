Whooping crane (Grus americana), tallest American bird and one of the worldâ€™s rarest. At the beginning of the 21st century fewer than 300 whooping cranes remained in the wild. Most are part of a flock that migrates between Texas and Canada. Almost all the rest are part of a mainly nonmigrating Florida population.
Similar to the sandhill crane, the whooping crane is almost 150 cm (5 feet) tall and has a wingspan of about 210 cm (7 feet). It is white with black-tipped wings, black legs, and a bare red face and crown. It has a whooping call purported to be audible for 2 miles (3.2 km). Courtship displays include a leaping dance replete with flapping, bowing, and other movements.
