Rita Hayworth, original name Margarita Carmen Cansino   (born October 17, 1918, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died May 14, 1987, New York, New York) American motion-picture actress and dancer who rose to glamorous stardom in the 1940s and ’50s.
The daughter of Spanish-born dancer Eduardo Cansino and his partner, Volga Haworth, Hayworth as a child worked as a professional dancer with her parents’ nightclub act. While still a teenager, she appeared on-screen under her given name of Rita Cansino in films such as Charlie Chan in Egypt (1935), Dante’s Inferno (1935), and Meet Nero Wolfe (1936). On the advice of her first husband, Edward Judson (who became her manager), she changed her name and dyed her hair auburn, cultivating a sophisticated glamour that first registered with her role as an unfaithful wife who tries to seduce Cary Grant in Only Angels Have Wings (1939).
