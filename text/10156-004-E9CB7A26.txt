Lygaeid bug (family Lygaeidae), any of a group of insects in the true bug order, Heteroptera, that includes many important crop pests. There are between 3,000 and 5,000 species of lygaeid bugs, which vary from brown to brightly patterned with red, white, or black spots and bands. The large milkweed bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus) is distinguished by its broad red and black bands. They range from 3 to 15 mm (0.1 to 0.6 inch) in length, although they are usually less than 10 mm.
The family is sometimes called the chinch bug family because one species, the destructive chinch bug, feeds on the sap of plants. Other important members of the family include the Old World, or Egyptian, cotton stainer (Oxycarenus hyalinipennis) and the Australian Nysius vinitor, both of which are destructive to fruit trees, and the predatory Geocoris punctipes, which feeds on mites, termites, and other small plant-feeding insects.
