Antihistamine, any of a group of synthetic drugs that selectively counteract the pharmacological effects of histamine, following its release from certain large cells (mast cells) within the body. Antihistamines replace histamine at one or the other of the two receptor sites at which it becomes bound in various susceptible tissues, thereby preventing histamine-triggered reactions under conditions such as stress, inflammation, and allergy. Antihistamines with powerful antiemetic properties are used in the treatment of motion sickness and vomiting.
Histamine is a chemical messenger involved in a number of complex biological actions. It occurs mainly in an inactive bound form in most body tissues. When released, it interacts with specific histamine receptors on the cell surface or within a target cell to elicit changes in many different bodily functions. Four types of pharmacological histamine receptor have been described: H1, H2, H3, and H4. All four are structurally similar and are classified as so-called G protein-coupled receptors (receptors that transmit signals to an intracellular molecule called a guanine nucleotide-binding, or G, protein). They differ, however, with respect to their tissue distribution and biological effects.
