Thomas Mott Osborne,  (born September 23, 1859, Auburn, New York, U.S.—died October 20, 1926, Auburn) American penologist whose inauguration of self-help programs for prisoners through Mutual Welfare Leagues functioned as a model for the humanitarian programs of later penologists.
Osborne served two terms on the Auburn Board of Education and in 1903 was elected mayor of Auburn, serving one term. In 1913 he became chairman of the New York State Commission on Prison Reform, a post that inspired him to spend a week in Auburn Prison as “Tom Brown” to learn about conditions firsthand. Convinced thereby that (in the British statesman W.E. Gladstone’s phrase) “it is liberty alone that fits men for liberty,” he founded a Mutual Welfare League of the Auburn prisoners, which assumed such responsibilities as forming committees to judge violators of prison rules and to plan entertainment events.
