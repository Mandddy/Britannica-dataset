Nomadic groups of Apache Indians lived in the region for centuries, refusing to recognize Spanish, Mexican, or U.S. claims of ownership. Development of the region’s mineral resources began with a copper mine established by the Spanish in the early 1800s. Led by chief Mangas Coloradas, Apaches attacked white prospectors and farmers who arrived after the mid-19th century and who proliferated after gold was discovered in 1860. Fort Bayard was established in 1866 to provide protection.
