Gertrude Berg, née Gertrude Edelstein   (born Oct. 3, 1899, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Sept. 14, 1966, New York City)  American actor, producer, and screenwriter whose immensely popular situation comedy about the Goldberg family ran in various radio, television, stage, and film versions between 1929 and 1953.
In December 1918, while enrolled in a playwriting extension course at Columbia University, Gertrude Edelstein met and married Lewis Berg. Having begun to write radio scripts, Gertrude Berg proposed to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) a weekly series called The Rise of the Goldbergs. A situation comedy featuring the trials and domestic adventures of a Jewish family in the Bronx, the program premiered on November 20, 1929, in a 15-minute format with Berg herself playing the inimitable Molly Goldberg, the chatty and philosophical mother in the fictional family. Writer and producer as well as star of the show, she created virtually an entire neighbourhood of characters and incidents and won an audience that eventually numbered in the millions. In 1931, by which time the radio show was being broadcast five times a week, Berg published a book entitled The Rise of the Goldbergs. The series aired weekly until 1934 and was broadcast briefly in 1936 and again briefly in 1937. It aired regularly from 1938 to 1945 and had a last run in 1949–50.
