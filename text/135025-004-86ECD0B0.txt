Henry R. Luce, in full Henry Robinson Luce   (born April 3, 1898, Dengzhou, Shondong province, China—died February 28, 1967, Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.) American magazine publisher who built a publishing empire on Time, Fortune, and Life magazines, becoming one of the most powerful figures in the history of American journalism. Luce’s publications, founded as a means of educating what he considered a poorly informed American public, had many imitators. Time, a “weekly newsmagazine,” sought to present news in narrative form. The magazine also stressed world events, an area that Luce believed was neglected in American newspapers and magazines. Presenting each story in a specific section or department, Time generally suggested what readers should think with regard to the subjects covered. Luce publications frequently utilized library research materials to make stories and articles more complete. Reporters and editors worked together on stories in what was called group journalism.
Luce was one of four children born to a Presbyterian missionary family, and his first decade was spent in China. At age 10 Luce was sent to a British boarding school at Yantai in North China. From there he went alone to England and then to the United States to attend preparatory school and Yale University. There he edited the school paper, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and graduated in 1920, noted as “most brilliant” in his class.
