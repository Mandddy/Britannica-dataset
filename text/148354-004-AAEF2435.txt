ʿAlawite, Arabic ʿAlawī, plural ʿAlawīyah, also called Nuṣayrī, plural Nuṣayrīyah, or Namīrī, plural Namīrīyah, or Ansarī, plural Ansarīyah,  any member of a minority sect of Shīʿite Muslims living chiefly in Syria.
The roots of ʿAlawism lie in the teachings of Muḥammad ibn Nuṣayr an-Namīrī (fl. 850), a Basran contemporary of the 10th Shīʿite imam, and the sect was chiefly established by Ḥusayn ibn Ḥamdān al-Khaṣībī (d. 957 or 968) during the period of the Ḥamdānid dynasty (905–1004), at which time the ʿAlawites had great influence in Aleppo. With the fall of Shiʿite rule, however, the ʿAlawites, with other Shīʿites, became the victims of persecution. They were ill-treated by waves of Crusaders, by Mamlūks, and by Ottoman conquerors, in addition to fighting a number of internecine wars.
