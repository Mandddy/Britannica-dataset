Euchre, card game popular in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Great Britain, especially in Cornwall and the West Country of England. It derives from a 19th-century Alsatian game called juckerspiel from the fact that its two top trumps are Jucker, meaning “jack.” This word may also have influenced the choice of the term joker for the extra card introduced into American euchre in the 1860s to act as the “best bower,” or topmost trump; bower is from German Bauer, literally “farmer” but also meaning “jack.” Euchre is therefore the game for which the joker was invented—the joker being, in effect, a glorified jack.
Euchre is played in various ways by various numbers of players. In the four-hand partnership game, each player is dealt five cards in a three-two or two-three sequence from a 24- or 32-card deck, to either of which a joker may be added. The undealt cards are stacked facedown and the topmost card turned faceup as a prospective trump. From highest to lowest, the order of cards in the trump suit is best bower (if a joker is used), right bower (jack of trump), left bower (other jack of same colour as trump), followed by A, K, Q, 10, 9 (8, 7). In other suits cards rank A, K, Q, J (if not left bower), 10, 9 (8, 7).
