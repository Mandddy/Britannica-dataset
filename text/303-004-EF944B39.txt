Ralph Ellison, in full Ralph Waldo Ellison  (born March 1, 1914, Oklahoma City, Okla., U.S.—died April 16, 1994, New York, N.Y.) American writer who won eminence with his first novel (and the only one published during his lifetime), Invisible Man (1952).
Ellison left Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute (now Tuskegee University) in 1936 after three years’ study of music and moved to New York City. There he befriended Richard Wright, who encouraged Ellison to try his hand at writing. In 1937 Ellison began contributing short stories, reviews, and essays to various periodicals. He worked on the Federal Writers’ Project from 1938 to 1942, which he followed with a stint as the managing editor of The Negro Quarterly for just under a year.
