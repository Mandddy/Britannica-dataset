White Sands National Monument, an expanse of dazzling white gypsum sands in south-central New Mexico, U.S. The monument is situated in the Tularosa Basin, between Alamogordo (northeast) and Las Cruces (southwest). Established in 1933, it covers 225 square miles (583 square km).
The basin lies between the San Andres Mountains (west) and the Sacramento Mountains (east). The sand constantly drifts into dunes 10 to 60 feet (3 to 18 metres) high. In the southwest corner of the monument is Lake Lucero, a usually dry marsh (playa) encrusted with selenite crystals created by the evaporation of gypsum-laden runoff water. The gypsum is the product of decomposed limestone, which is the predominant rock type of the surrounding region. The extensive Alkali Flat area, to the north of the lake, is similarly created by underground water drawn to the surface. There is little plant life; the animals, mainly mice and lizards, are light-hued, blending with the sand. To the west is San Andres National Wildlife Refuge. White Sands Missile Range encircles the monument, and Holloman Air Force Base lies to the east.
