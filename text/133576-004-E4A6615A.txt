Rowan Atkinson, in full Rowan Sebastian Atkinson  (born January 6, 1955, Newcastle upon Tyne, England) British actor and comedian who delighted television and film audiences with his comic creation Mr. Bean.
Atkinson, the son of wealthy Durham farmers, attended Durham Cathedral Choristers’ School. At the University of Newcastle upon Tyne he studied electrical engineering; he progressed to the University of Oxford for a master’s degree. Taking to the stage to satisfy an inner urge, he began honing the facial contortions and manic comedic genius that would soon make him famous. While attending Oxford, he began working with actor Richard Curtis and composer Howard Goodall, and together they ventured to the Edinburgh Festival. There Atkinson’s classic schoolmaster sketch rocketed him to fame. In 1979 the satirical television show Not the Nine O’Clock News introduced him to millions of British viewers, and in 1981 he became the youngest person at the time to have had a one-man show in London’s West End.
