Pierre-Daniel Huet,  Huet also spelled Huetius   (born Feb. 8, 1630, Caen, France—died  Jan. 26, 1721, Paris) French scholar, antiquary, scientist, and bishop whose incisive skepticism, particularly as embodied in his cogent attacks on René Descartes, greatly influenced contemporary philosophers.
After studying mathematics with the Jesuits, Huet visited the court of Queen Christina of Sweden in 1652. His discovery in the Swedish royal library of some fragments of a commentary on St. Matthew by the Greek theologian Origen (c. ad 185–c. 254) led to an edition of Origen in 1668.
