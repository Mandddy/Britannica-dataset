Haboob, strong wind that occurs primarily along the southern edges of the Sahara in Sudan and is associated with large sandstorms and dust storms and may be accompanied by thunderstorms. It usually lasts about three hours, is most common during the summer, and may blow from any direction. This wind tends to originate in the north during the winter months and the south, southeast, and east in summer. A haboob may transport huge quantities of sand or dust, which move as a dense wall that can reach a height of 1,000 metres (about 3,300 feet).
Haboobs are also common in other parts of the Sahara desert and in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in arid parts of North America, such as Arizona and Texas, and in Australia, Central Asia, and China. The term haboob is taken from the Arabic word habb, meaning “wind.”
