Frank McCourt, original name Francis McCourt  (born August 19, 1930, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died July 19, 2009, New York, New York) American author and teacher who was perhaps best known for the memoir Angela’s Ashes (1996), for which he won a Pulitzer Prize.
Frank was the first child of Irish immigrants Malachy and Angela McCourt. The Great Depression and his father’s alcoholism kept the family destitute, and, when Frank was four years old, the McCourts left New York to join relatives in Limerick, Ireland. The family’s situation failed to improve, however. The title Angela’s Ashes refers to McCourt’s memory of his mother staring into the unlit fireplace. At age 10 he nearly died of typhoid fever. During 14 weeks in the hospital, he read voraciously while confined to his bed. In 1941 his father left for England, supposedly to work in a wartime munitions factory, but the family never received the money he had promised to send.
