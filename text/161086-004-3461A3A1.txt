Christiane Amanpour,  (born January 12, 1958, London, England) English-born journalist who, as a correspondent for the Cable News Network (CNN), was one of the leading war reporters of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. She later hosted the ABC news program This Week in 2010–11.
Amanpour’s father, an Iranian airline executive, moved the family to Tehrān shortly after her birth. Politically connected and wealthy, the Amanpours led a privileged life in Iran. At age 11, Amanpour was sent back to England to attend the Holy Cross Convent School in Buckinghamshire. She stayed at Holy Cross until she was 16, when she went to the exclusive New Hall School, the oldest Roman Catholic girls’ school in the United Kingdom. In January 1979 the Islamic revolution in Iran toppled the shah, forcing many of his followers to leave the country, the Amanpour family among them. Her father lost everything he had owned in Iran. Amanpour later credited her desire to be a journalist to this firsthand experience.
