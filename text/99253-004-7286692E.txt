Ferde Grofé, byname of Ferdinand Rudolph von Grofé  (born March 27, 1892, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died April 3, 1972, Santa Monica, Calif.) American composer and arranger known for his orchestral works as well as for his pioneering role in establishing the sound of big band dance music.
Grofé was reared in Los Angeles, where his father was an actor and singer and his mother taught music and played cello. Although his parents had wanted him to study law, he left college to focus on music. By 1908 he was performing as a violinist, violist, and pianist. He played viola with the Los Angeles Symphony from 1909 through 1919; concurrently, he worked with drummer Art Hickman’s orchestra starting in 1914. For Hickman, Grofé conceived arrangements that divided the ensemble into separate brass and reed sections, writing countermelodies to the main melody and using different musical settings for each return of the chorus to a piece. His innovations were an important early step in the development of big band jazz and dance music.
