Middlesex, historic county of southeasternEngland, incorporating central London north of the River Thames and surrounding areas to the north and west. Most of Middlesex, for administrative purposes, became part of Greater London in 1965.
The River Thames was the key to the history of Middlesex. From about 8000 bce traders and settlers used the Thames as their waterway. During the Iron Age (c. 500 bce) settlements existed at Brentford and Heathrow. In the 1st century bce Belgic tribes had established themselves in southeastern England, and Middlesex formed part of the Catuvellauni territory. The Romans set up outposts at what became Staines and Brentford. In the early 5th century ce the Saxons began to colonize the area. Positioned as it was between the East and West Saxons, the region soon obtained its modern name (meaning “middle Saxons”); the earliest written record of it is in the form Middelseaxan, in a charter of 704.
