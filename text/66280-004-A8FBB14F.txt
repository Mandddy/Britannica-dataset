Errol Flynn, in full Errol Leslie Thomson Flynn  (born June 20, 1909, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia—died Oct. 14, 1959, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) Australian actor, celebrated during his short but colourful lifetime as the screen’s foremost swashbuckler.
Flynn was the son of a prominent Australian marine biologist and zoologist. As such, he was sent to the best schools available—and was expelled from virtually all of them. Flynn’s restless, rebellious nature carried over into his early adulthood, as he unsuccessfully pursued such professions as government official, plantation overseer, gold miner, and journalist. In 1933 an Australian film producer saw some photographs of Flynn and offered the ruggedly handsome 24-year-old the role of the mutineer Fletcher Christian in the semidocumentary feature In the Wake of the Bounty. Encouraged by this experience to pursue acting as a career, Flynn joined England’s Northampton Repertory Company, which led to a few roles in British films and ultimately to a contract with Warner Bros. in Hollywood. When Robert Donat dropped out of the title role in the expensive adventure film Captain Blood (1935), Warners took a chance on Flynn, thereby assuring stardom for him. Typecast as a dashing, fearless adventurer, he went on to star in such colourful costume dramas as The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), and The Sea Hawk (1940) and also such big-budget westerns as Dodge City (1939) and They Died with Their Boots On (1941). Unable to serve in World War II because of various physical ailments, he instead acted the part of a soldier in such films as Desperate Journey (1942) and Objective, Burma! (1945).
