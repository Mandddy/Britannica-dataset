Rudolf von Gneist,  (born August 13, 1816, Berlin, Prussia [now in Germany]—died July 22, 1895, Berlin) liberal German jurist, legal reformer, legislator, and political theoretician whose teachings and publications, based on studies of the English system of government, exercised a profound influence on the development of German administrative law.
The son of a supreme court judge, he studied at Berlin University under Friedrich Karl von Savigny, a renowned jurist. In 1841 he became an assistant judge and from 1847 served in the Berlin high court. His opposition to the reactionary policy after the 1848–49 revolution led to his resignation in 1849. Devoting himself to an academic career, Gneist began to produce the series of works in which he praised British political and administrative institutions. These studies were continued in Verwaltung, Justiz, Rechtsweg, Staatsverwaltung und Selbstverwaltung nach englischen und deutschen Verhältnissen mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Verwaltungsreformen und Kreisreformen in Preussen (1869; “Administration, Justice, Legal Procedure, Government Administration, and Local Administration According to English and German Conditions with Special Regard to Administrative Reforms and District Reforms in Prussia”), in which Gneist stressed the virtues of justices of the peace. His Englische Verfassungsgeschichte (1882) was translated as The History of the English Constitution (1886). His talents in the field of administrative law were recognized when he was appointed a member of Germany’s first supreme administrative court (1875).
