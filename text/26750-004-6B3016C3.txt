Allen Tate, in full John Orley Allen Tate  (born November 19, 1899, Winchester, Kentucky, U.S.—died February 9, 1979, Nashville, Tennessee) American poet, teacher, novelist, and a leading exponent of the New Criticism. In both his criticism and his poetry, he emphasized the writer’s need for a tradition to adhere to; he found his tradition in the culture of the conservative, agrarian South and, later, in Roman Catholicism, to which he converted in 1950.
In 1918 Tate entered Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where he helped found The Fugitive (1922–25), a magazine for a group of young poets known as the Fugitives. Tate introduced the Fugitives to the poetry of T.S. Eliot, whose attitudes toward modern life and whose emphasis on the hollowness of modern man found an echo in Tate’s own themes. Tate contributed to the symposium I’ll Take My Stand (1930), a manifesto defending the traditional agrarian society of the South.
