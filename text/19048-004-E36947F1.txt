Mocenigo Family,  one of the most renowned patrician families of the Venetian Republic, to which it supplied military leaders, scholars, churchmen, diplomats, and statesmen, including seven doges.
Tommaso Mocenigo (1343–1423) commanded a crusading fleet that sacked Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulg.) in 1396. Elected doge in 1414, he extended Venetian dominion over the Trentino, Friuli, and Dalmatia. Yet his statesmanship was essentially pacific, and he is best remembered for a deathbed address in which he described with many details the flourishing commercial state of Venice and admonished against military adventures. Tommaso’s nephew Pietro (1406–76) was one of the greatest Venetian admirals. Reorganizing the Venetian fleet after the defeat of Negroponte (1470) at the hands of the Turks, he conducted successful reprisals, taking Smyrna in 1472 and raising the Turkish siege of Scutari (now Shkodër, Alb.). He was elected doge in 1474; a new Venetian coin struck during his reign was given the family name. His brother Giovanni (1408–85) became doge in 1478 and succeeded in concluding peace with the Ottoman Empire; in the War of Ferrara he acquired Rovigo and Polesine for Venice.
