Patrick family, Canadian family who as managers, owners, and league officials helped establish professional ice hockey in Canada. Lester B. Patrick (b. December 30, 1883, Drummondville, Quebec, Canada—d. June 1, 1960, Victoria, British Columbia) and his brother Frank A. Patrick (b. December 23, 1885, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada—d. June 29, 1960, Vancouver, British Columbia) were especially noted for aiding the expansion of the National Hockey League (NHL) to the United States.
The brothers played hockey while attending McGill University (Montreal), Lester with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association team (1901–02) and the amateur Montreal Wanderers (1905–07), both of which won Stanley Cups, and for the Brandon (Manitoba) team that played for but did not win the Stanley Cup (1903–05). Frank refereed in the Montreal senior league (1903–04), and the two joined the Renfrew Millionaires in the professional league that came to be the National Hockey Association (NHA; formed 1910).
