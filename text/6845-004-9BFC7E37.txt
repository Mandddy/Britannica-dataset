Wernher von Braun,  (born March 23, 1912, Wirsitz, Ger. [now Wyrzysk, Pol.]—died June 16, 1977, Alexandria, Va., U.S.) German engineer who played a prominent role in all aspects of rocketry and space exploration, first in Germany and after World War II in the United States.
Braun was born into a prosperous aristocratic family. His mother encouraged young Wernher’s curiosity by giving him a telescope upon his confirmation in the Lutheran church. Braun’s early interest in astronomy and the realm of space never left him thereafter. In 1920 his family moved to the seat of government, Berlin. He did not do well in school, particularly in physics and mathematics. A turning point in his life occurred in 1925 when he acquired a copy of Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (“The Rocket into Interplanetary Space”) by a rocket pioneer, Hermann Oberth. Frustrated by his inability to understand the mathematics, he applied himself at school until he led his class.
