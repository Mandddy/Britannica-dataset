Hidalgo, county, southwestern New Mexico, U.S.; it is bordered by Arizona on the west and Mexico on the south and east. The county’s northwestern area, featuring alkali flats and crossed by the Gila River, lies in the Colorado Plateau. The remainder is in the Mexican Highland section of the Basin and Range Province, featuring plains frequently interrupted by scrub-covered hills and mountain ranges. The Peloncillo, Animas, Alamo Hueco, Pyramid, San Luis, Whitewater, and Big and Little Hatchet ranges are all within the county’s borders; the highest mountain, Animas Peak, rises to 8,532 feet (2,600 m). Canyons and dry creek beds mark the locations where waters once spilled down mountainsides into the valleys. The Coronado and Gila national forests are within Hidalgo county, and the Continental Divide crosses it.
The U.S. Army’s Mormon Battalion marched through the area in 1846 during the Mexican War. Indigenous Apache Indians, led by the chiefs Mangas Coloradas and Cochise, fought white settlers from 1861 to 1874. After silver was discovered in the Pyramids in 1870, Shakespeare became a thriving town. Though depressions in 1875 and 1893 brought lapses in mining activity, silver mining thrived again there from 1908 to 1932. The county was established in 1919.
