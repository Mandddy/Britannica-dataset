Maurice Rouvier,  (born April 17, 1842, Aix-en-Provence, France—died  June 7, 1911, Neuilly) French statesman who had some success in balancing the budget during periods of his seven terms as minister of finance and two terms as premier.
Having launched the republican journal L’Égalité in 1870, Rouvier, a supporter of Léon Gambetta—one of the founding fathers of the Third Republic—served as deputy in the National Assembly from 1871 to 1902. A financial technician, he served on budget commissions, often as chairman, and as minister for commerce and the colonies (1881–82) and for commerce (1884–85). Resisting pressure from rightists to include General Georges Boulanger in his cabinet, Rouvier became premier (May–November 1887) with the support of moderate republicans. Minister of finance from 1889, he became implicated in the Panama Scandal and, though he apparently did not profit personally, was forced to resign in 1892. He was elected senator in 1902 and served as minister of finance (1902–05) and as premier and minister of finance (1905–06). In June 1905 he took over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after Théophile Delcassé resigned over the Franco-German crisis in Morocco. Rouvier fell from power (March 1906) over questions arising from the government’s decisive measures for the separation of church and state.
