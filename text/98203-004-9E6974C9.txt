Amélie Mauresmo,  (born July 5, 1979, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) French professional tennis player who won two Grand Slam titles—the Australian Open and Wimbledon—in 2006.
Mauresmo was not yet four when she watched countryman Yannick Noah win the French Open, and his victory inspired her to take up the game. She took to tennis easily, and in 1996 she was ranked the number one junior player in the world. She won the junior French Open and Wimbledon titles during that campaign and was named junior world champion by the International Tennis Federation.
