Diprotodon, also called giant wombat,  extinct genus of marsupial classified in the suborder Vombatiformes and considered to be the largest known group of marsupial mammals. Diprotodon lived during the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) in Australia and is a close relative of living wombats and koalas. Its name in Latin means “two forward teeth.”
Similar to living wombats and koalas, Diprotodon was quadrupedal and browsed plant material. Diprotodon, however, was much larger, standing about 1.8 metres (about 6 feet) tall at the shoulder and measuring as much as 4 metres (12 feet) long. The largest specimens are thought to have weighed more than 2,700 kg (about 3 tons) in life. Diprotodon shares many skeletal, cranial, and dental features with its modern cousins, including two long forward-projecting lower incisors that occluded (that is, were brought into contact) with four square-shaped upper incisors. Its molars and premolars had a series of lophs (ridges) running transversely from the cheek to the tongue. These structures likely provided a grating mechanism for chewing, such that Diprotodon crushed and shredded the plant material in its diet in a manner similar to that of modern kangaroos. The skull was massive and narrow with an unusually large nasal aperture, suggesting that the animal had a large nose or, possibly, a short tapirlike trunk.
