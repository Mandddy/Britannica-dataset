Coelostat, device consisting of a flat mirror that is turned slowly by a motor to reflect a portion of the sky continuously into a fixed telescope. The mirror is mounted to rotate about an axis through its front surface that points to a celestial pole and is driven at the rate of one revolution in 48 hours. The telescope image is then stationary and nonrotating. The coelostat is particularly useful in eclipse expeditions when elaborate equatorial mounting of telescopes is impossible. Other instruments that are used to reflect light into a fixed telescope are the heliostat, which produces an image of the Sun, and the siderostat, which is like a heliostat but is used to observe stars. The coelostat was invented by French physicist Gabriel Lippmann in 1895.
