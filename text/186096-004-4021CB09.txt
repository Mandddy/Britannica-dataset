Folger Shakespeare Library, research centre in Washington, D.C., for the study of William Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and Elizabethan society and culture. The library, with more than 240,000 books and manuscripts (from the late 13th century to the present), possesses an unrivaled collection of Shakespeare’s work, including 82 copies of the First Folio (1623), 119 copies of the later folios, and about 7,000 other Shakespeare editions. It also possesses 90,000 prints, drawings, photographs, and paintings; some 250,000 playbills; and assorted films, recordings, musical instruments, costumes, and theatrical memorabilia. Among the earliest Folger incunabula is a 1477 edition of Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales produced by William Caxton in England’s first printing shop, located in Westminster.
The library, founded in 1932 and administered by the trustees of Amherst College, is named for Henry Clay Folger, chairman of the Standard Oil Company of New York. His will bequeathed his Shakespeare collection to the American people and provided the necessary funds to house, maintain, and expand it.
