Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt,  (born Sept. 6, 1817, London, Eng.â€”died  Sept. 19, 1893, Montreal, Que., Can.) Canadian businessman, statesman, and influential early advocate of federation.
Galt emigrated from England to Sherbrooke, Lower Canada (later Canada East, now Quebec), in 1835 and worked for the British American Land Company, serving as a commissioner from 1844 to 1855. In this role he built up an understanding with the eastern townships and the English-speaking minority of Canada East. He gave active support to the promotion of the St. Lawrence and Atlantic and the Grand Trunk railways. He entered politics in 1849 as an independent member for Sherbrooke County in the legislature of the united province of Canada. Reflecting the opinion of his English-speaking constituents, he did not support the bill compensating citizens for losses incurred by French-Canadians during the 1837 rebellion. He favoured annexation by the United States in order to achieve Anglo-Saxon ascendancy over the French Roman Catholic majority in Canada East and, more overtly, to promote economic growth. He resigned from the legislature in 1850 but was reelected for Sherbrooke town in 1853; he maintained that seat and remained leader of the English-speaking minority until 1872.
