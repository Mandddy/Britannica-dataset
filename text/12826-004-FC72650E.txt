Click beetle (family Elateridae), also called skipjack, snapping beetle, or spring beetle,  any of approximately 7,000 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) named for the clicking noise made when seized by a predator. Most click beetles range between 2.5 and 18 mm (less than 0.75 inch) in length and are brown or black in colour with either little or no ornamentation. However, some tropical species are brightly coloured or luminescent. Click beetles have elongated bodies with parallel sides and bluntly rounded ends.
When a click beetle is touched, it falls on its back and plays dead. To right itself the click beetle bends its head and thorax forward, hooking a spine into a notch on the abdomen. When the spine is released, it makes a click, and the beetle is hurled into the air. Click beetles usually feed on leaves at night. Because they are attracted to sweet liquids, farmers once placed sweet baits in their fields in the spring to trap adults.
