Indri (Indri indri), slender, long-limbed primate found in the forests of Madagascar. The largest of the lemurs, it is 60–70 cm (24–28 inches) long, with a rudimentary tail and large hands and feet. The round head has a pointed face and round, furry ears. Its fur is black, with white on the head, throat, forearms, and buttocks; the relative proportions of white and black vary geographically. Active during the day and thoroughly arboreal, the indri clings to trees and climbs in an upright position as it feeds on leaves, fruit, flowers, and other vegetation.
The indri is an endangered species found only in remote parts of northeastern Madagascar, where it is protected by law. It is related to sifakas and avahis; together they constitute the leaping lemurs, family Indridae.
