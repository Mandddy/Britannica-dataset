Automatic rifle, rifle that utilizes either its recoil or a portion of the gas propelling the projectile to eject the spent cartridge case, load a new cartridge, and cock the weapon to fire again.
Automatic rifles should not be confused with semiautomatic rifles, as the latter fire only one shot at each pull of the trigger. An automatic rifle fires repeatedly as long as the trigger is held down, until the magazine is exhausted. That fully automatic firing is achieved by weapons such as the machine gun and submachine gun. In some models of assault rifles, fully automatic fire can be substituted for one-shot or three-shot burst fire by flicking a switch on the weapon. Most modern infantry rifles are assault rifles or carbines with fully automatic or burst fire capabilities.
