Fanny Kemble, in full Frances Ann Kemble  (born Nov. 27, 1809, London, Eng.—died Jan. 15, 1893, London) popular English actress who is also remembered as the author of plays, poems, and reminiscences, the latter containing much information about the stage and social history of the 19th century.
Kemble was the eldest daughter of actors Charles Kemble and Maria Theresa De Camp, and the niece of two of the most distinguished English actors of the later 18th century, John Philip Kemble and his sister Sarah Siddons. In order to save her father from bankruptcy, Fanny Kemble made her debut in his company at Covent Garden in London in October 1829, playing Juliet. Her success was instantaneous, and she was able to recoup the family’s and indeed the theatre’s fortunes, at least for a time. She was an even greater success in 1830 in The Hunchback, which Sheridan Knowles wrote for her. However great her successes, she disliked both acting and the theatrical profession, taking to the stage only when she needed money.
