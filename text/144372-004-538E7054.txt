University of Sydney, coeducational institution of higher learning in Sydney, nominally private but supported financially by both the Commonwealth of Australia and New South Wales. Founded in 1850, it is Australia’s oldest university as well as its largest.
The university is composed of six resident colleges: St. Paul’s (Church of England), which was founded in 1854; St. John’s (Roman Catholic), 1857; St. Andrew’s (Presbyterian), 1867; Women’s College (nondenominational), 1889; Wesley College (Uniting), 1910; and Sancta Sophia College (Roman Catholic, principally women), 1929. Women were first admitted to the university in 1881.
