Joseph T. Robinson,  (born Aug. 26, 1872, near Lonoke, Ark., U.S.—died  July 14, 1937, Washington, D.C.) American lawyer and legislator, a major figure in the enactment of New Deal legislation. He represented Arkansas in the U.S. House of Representatives (1903–13) and the U.S. Senate (1913–37).
Admitted to the bar in 1895, Robinson practiced law in Lonoke. In 1902 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for 10 years. Elected governor of Arkansas in 1912, he resigned a few months later to assume the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Jeff Davis, himself a former Arkansas governor. Robinson was successively reelected until his death, eventually becoming Senate majority leader under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1928 Robinson ran as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate on the losing ticket with Al Smith. As minority leader in the Senate, Robinson in 1929 pledged to cooperate with Hoover’s economic program; he soon found himself at odds with the new president, however, and tried to convince him to step up relief efforts and public-works projects.
