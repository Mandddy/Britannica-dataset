A large, portly man, he was the self-appointed leader of the Algonquin Round Table, an informal luncheon club at New York City’s Algonquin Hotel in the 1920s and ’30s.
After graduating from Hamilton College, Clinton, New York, he joined the staff of The New York Times in 1909 as a cub reporter and succeeded to the post of drama critic in 1914. After a brief stint (1917–18) in the U.S. Army, reporting for The Stars and Stripes, he returned to the Times and subsequently worked for the New York Herald and the New York World. He also wrote for The New Yorker, and in 1929 he branched out into the radio field as “The Town Crier” of the air, establishing a nationwide reputation as raconteur, gossip, conversationalist, wit, and man-about-town. As a literary critic, he wielded great influence on the nation’s book-buying public.
