Alexander, Serbo-Croatian in full Aleksandar Obrenović   (born Aug. 14 [Aug. 2, Old Style], 1876, Belgrade, Serbia—died  June 11 [May 29], 1903, Belgrade) king of Serbia (1889–1903), whose unpopular authoritarian reign resulted not only in his assassination but also in the end of the Obrenović dynasty.
The only child of Prince (later King) Milan (reigned 1868–89) and his consort, Natalie, Alexander ascended the Serbian throne on March 6 (Feb. 22), 1889, after his father had abdicated and named a regency council for the youthful Alexander. On April 13 (April 1), 1893, Alexander dismissed the regency council and assumed active control of the government.
