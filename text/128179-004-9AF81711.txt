Severus Alexander, also called Alexander Severus, in full Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander, original name Gessius Bassianus Alexianus or Alexianus Bassianus  (born 209, Phoenicia [now in Lebanon]—died  235, Gaul) Roman emperor from ad 222 to 235, whose weak rule collapsed in the civil strife that engulfed the empire for the next 50 years. His maternal grandmother, Julia Maesa, was a sister-in-law of the emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193–211).
In 218 the legions in Syria proclaimed as emperor Alexander’s 14-year-old cousin, Elagabalus (Heliogabalus), who was persuaded (221) to adopt Alexander as his heir. In March 222 the Praetorian Guard—probably prompted by Julia Maesa and Alexander’s mother, Julia Mamaea—murdered Elagabalus. Alexander succeeded to power without incident. During his reign the real authority was held by his grandmother (until her death in 226) and his mother. The appointment of a regency council of 16 senators provided the Senate with nominal ruling power.
