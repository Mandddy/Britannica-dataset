Eugen Bleuler,  (born April 30, 1857, Zollikon, Switzerland—died July 15, 1939, Zollikon) one of the most influential psychiatrists of his time, best known today for his introduction of the term schizophrenia to describe the disorder previously known as dementia praecox and for his studies of schizophrenics.
Bleuler studied medicine at the University of Bern and later was appointed professor of psychiatry at the University of Zürich and director of the Burghölzli Asylum in Zürich, where he served from 1898 to 1927. He first advanced the term schizophrenia in 1908 in a paper based on a study of 647 Burghölzli patients. He then expanded on his paper of 1908 in Dementia Praecox oder Gruppe der Schizophrenien (1911; Dementia Praecox; or, The Group of Schizophrenias). He argued in this monograph that dementia praecox was not a single disease, was not invariably incurable, and did not always progress to full dementia. Each of these conclusions was at odds with the accepted wisdom of the time. He described a group of diseases, the schizophrenias, the basic symptoms of which were a disordered train of mental associations and splitting or fragmentation of the personality. He believed that many cases were latent (not fully expressed) and suggested that schizophrenics could in some cases have derangements of thought processes on specific questions rather than generally in all circumstances.
