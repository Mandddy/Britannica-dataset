Windham, county, southeastern Vermont, U.S., bounded to the west by the Green Mountains, to the south by Massachusetts, and to the east by New Hampshire (the Connecticut River constitutes the border). It is a hilly upland with elevations generally rising to the west. The principal watercourses are the West, Deerfield, Saxtons, Green, and Rock rivers and the Somerset and Harriman reservoirs. The county mostly comprises a coniferous forest, particularly spruce, fir, and white pine. Parklands include Townshend, Jamaica, Fort Dummer, Molly Stark, and Dutton Pines state parks. Other recreational areas are Green Mountain National Forest and the Stratton Mountain, Mount Snow, and Haystack Mountain ski resorts. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail passes through the western corner of the county.
Fort Dummer (built 1724) in Brattleboro was the first permanent British settlement in Vermont. Windham county was created in 1781 and named for either Wyndham, England, or Windham county, Connecticut. John Humphrey Noyes, a native of Brattleboro, established a utopian society in Putney (1836â€“46) before reestablishing it at Oneida, New York (1848). Notable landmarks are the Rockingham Meeting House (1787) in Rockingham, the Old Tavern Inn (1801) in Grafton, and Abenaki Indian petroglyphs and the Old Stone Grist Mill (1831), both in Bellows Falls. The county contains about a dozen covered bridges.
