Landon Donovan,  (born March 4, 1982, Ontario, California, U.S.) American professional football (soccer) player, widely regarded as the greatest American male player in the history of the sport.
Donovan was a star player in high school in Redlands, California, and in 1998 he joined the U.S. national under-17 (U-17) team. His success in U-17 play drew the attention of German club Bayer Leverkusen, which signed the teenage Donovan in 1999. He played on the Bayer reserve team for one season and was called up to the first team in 2000, but he did not appear in a game before being loaned to the San Jose (California) Earthquakes of Major League Soccer (MLS) in March 2001.
