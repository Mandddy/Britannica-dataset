Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae,  (born March 14, 1821, Vejle, Den.—died  Aug. 15, 1885, Copenhagen) Danish archaeologist, a principal founder of prehistoric archaeology. His Danmarks Oldtid oplyst ved Oldsager og Gravhøie (1843; The Primeval Antiquities of Denmark) was one of the most influential archaeological works of the 19th century.
At an early age Worsaae studied stone monuments in Denmark and proved them to be tombs rather than altars, as had been supposed. From 1838 to 1843, while a student, he served as an assistant to Christian J. Thomsen, curator of Danish antiquities, and prepared Danmarks Oldtid. He then spent several years in Germany, France, England, and Ireland carrying on stratigraphic study and research that enabled him to refine Thomsen’s tripartite (Stone, Bronze, and Iron ages) classification of prehistory.
