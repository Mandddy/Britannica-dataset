Actaeon,  in Greek mythology, son of the minor god Aristaeus and Autonoë (daughter of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes in Boeotia); he was a Boeotian hero and hunter. According to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Actaeon accidentally saw Artemis (goddess of wild animals, vegetation, and childbirth) while she was bathing on Mount Cithaeron; for this reason he was changed by her into a stag and was pursued and killed by his own 50 hounds. In another version, he offended Artemis by boasting that his skill as a hunter surpassed hers.
The story was well-known in antiquity, and several of the tragic poets presented it on the stage (e.g., Aeschylus in his lost Toxotides, “The Female Archers”). Actaeon was worshiped in Plataea and Orchomenus.
