Finnish spitz, breed of dog native to Finland, where a breed standard has existed since 1812. It is nicknamed the “barking bird dog” for its habit of “yodeling,” or barking continuously, to alert the hunter to the location of game birds. The breed continues to be a sporting dog in Finland but elsewhere it fills the role of companion; the American Kennel Club placed it in the Non-Sporting group in 1988. The Finnish spitz stands about 15.5 to 20 inches (39 to 50 cm) and weighs 25 to 30 pounds (11 to 13 kg). A typical northern-type dog, the Finnish spitz has a foxlike face, with a pointed muzzle and prick ears; its tail curls over its back. Its bright coat in varying shades of golden red is thick and straight, with a few black hairs on the back and tail and sometimes a small white spot or stripe on the chest. In males there may be a ruff of fur over the shoulders. The Finnish spitz is characterized by a lively and alert disposition; it is an excellent watchdog and, true to its origins, is a “talker” that communicates by barking. It is the national breed of Finland.
