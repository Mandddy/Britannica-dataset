August Kekule von Stradonitz, original name Friedrich August Kekulé  (born Sept. 7, 1829, Darmstadt, Hesse—died July 13, 1896, Bonn, Ger.) German chemist who established the foundation for the structural theory in organic chemistry.
Kekule was born into an upper-middle-class family of civil servants and as a schoolboy demonstrated an aptitude for art and languages, as well as science subjects. Intending to be an architect, he entered the nearby University of Giessen, but soon he was “seduced” (as he later expressed it) to the study of chemistry by the attractive teaching of Justus Liebig.
