Charon, in Greek mythology, the son of Erebus and Nyx (Night), whose duty it was to ferry over the Rivers Styx and Acheron those souls of the deceased who had received the rites of burial. In payment he received the coin that was placed in the mouth of the corpse. In art, where he was first depicted in an Attic vase dating from about 500 bce, Charon was represented as a morose and grisly old man. Charon appears in Aristophanesâ€™ comedy Frogs (406 bce); Virgil portrayed him in Aeneid, Book VI (1st century bce); and he is a common character in the dialogues of Lucian (2nd century ce). In Etruscan mythology he was known as Charun and appeared as a death demon, armed with a hammer. Eventually he came to be regarded as the image of death and of the world below. As such he survives in Charos, or Charontas, the angel of death in modern Greek folklore.
