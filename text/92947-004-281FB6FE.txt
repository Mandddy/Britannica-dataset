Margaret Atwood, in full Margaret Eleanor Atwood  (born November 18, 1939, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) Canadian writer best known for her prose fiction and for her feminist perspective.
As an adolescent, Atwood divided her time between Toronto, her family’s primary residence, and the sparsely settled bush country in northern Canada, where her father, an entomologist, conducted research. She began writing at age five and resumed her efforts, more seriously, a decade later. After completing her university studies at Victoria College at the University of Toronto, Atwood earned a master’s degree in English literature from Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1962.
