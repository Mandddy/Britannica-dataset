Stan Getz, byname of Stanley Getz  (born Feb. 2, 1927, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  June 6, 1991, Malibu, Calif.) American jazz tenor saxophonist, perhaps the best-known musician of jazz’s “cool school,” noted for his mellow, lush tone.
Getz began studying the saxophone at age 13 and made his professional debut at 15. He played with the bands of Jack Teagarden, Stan Kenton, Jimmy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman, and he made some recordings under his own name in 1946. Getz’s breakthrough came the following year, when he was hired for Woody Herman’s Second Herd orchestra. As a member of an unusual sax section—three tenors and a baritone—Getz was one of the Herman band’s “Four Brothers,” who specialized in cool-toned modern jazz. Noted Getz solos during his tenure with Herman include his turn on the song “Four Brothers” (1947) and, especially, his celebrated performance of “Early Autumn” (1948). His tone was featherlight, vibratoless, and pure and showed the influence of his idol, Lester Young. Within a few years, Getz would perfect his own somewhat detached style, the cool jazz characteristic of the West Coast jazz movement, in which overt emotionalism was held in check.
