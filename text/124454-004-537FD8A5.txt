Periyar River, river in southern Kerala state, southwestern India. Periyar is also the name given to a lake in the riverâ€™s course. The river, 140 miles (225 km) long, rises in the Western Ghats range near the border with Tamil Nadu state and flows north a short distance to Periyar Lake. The lake, 12 square miles (31 square km) in area, is an artificial reservoir created by damming the river. It lies at an elevation of about 2,800 feet (850 metres), is ringed by mountain peaks, and is surrounded by a wildlife sanctuary. A tunnel carries water from the lake eastward through the mountains to the Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu, where it is used for irrigation.
From the lake the Periyar River continues to flow generally north to where it is impounded by an arch dam at Idukki that forms another large reservoir and is a major source of hydroelectric power for Kerala. The river continues northwest, descending out of the mountains and onto the coastal plain, and turns west before emptying into the Arabian Sea about 15 miles (24 km) north of Kochi. Several other dams have been built across the river since the late 20th century.
