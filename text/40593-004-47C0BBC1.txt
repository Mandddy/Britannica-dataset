Charles Francis Annesley Voysey,  (born May 28, 1857, Hessle, Yorkshire, Englandâ€”died February 12, 1941, Winchester, Hampshire) British architect and designer whose work was influential in Europe between 1890 and 1910 and was a source of Art Nouveau inspiration.
Voysey was the son of Charles Voysey, founder of the Theistic Church. He was articled to J.P. Seddon in 1874, became assistant to George Devey, the eminent country-house designer, in 1880, and set up his own practice in London about 1882. Voysey was soon successful as a designer of wallpaper and textiles that reflected the influence of Arthur Mackmurdo and William Morris. In 1888 his plans for small houses were published in The British Architect, and he received a series of building commissions.
