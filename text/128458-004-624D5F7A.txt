Garth Brooks, in full Troyal Garth Brooks  (born February 7, 1962, Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S.) American country music singer-songwriter whose crossover appeal to the pop market made him the top-selling solo artist of all time.
Brooks was born into a musical family; his mother had a brief recording career with Capitol Records in the 1950s. He initially exhibited little interest in music, however, preferring to concentrate on athletics. A track-and-field scholarship brought Brooks to Oklahoma State University, and it was there that he met guitarist Ty England, with whom he began performing at area nightclubs. Brooks graduated with a degree in advertising in 1984 and moved to Nashville the following year, hoping to break into the music business. This initial foray into the heart of country music was short-lived, however, and Brooks returned to Oklahoma after only a day. In 1986 he married Sandy Mahl, his college girlfriend, and a year later she accompanied him back to Nashville, where he was signed to Capitol Records in 1988.
