Antoine Bourdelle, in full Émile-Antoine Bourdelle  (born October 30, 1861, Montauban, France—died October 1, 1929, Paris) French sculptor whose works—exhibiting exaggerated, rippling surfaces mingled with the flat, decorative simplifications of Archaic Greek and Romanesque art—introduced a new vigour and strength into the sculpture of the early 20th century.
Bourdelle studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse, France, before moving to Paris in 1885. Reacting against the conservatism of the École, Bourdelle left to study with the artists Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and Jules Dalou. In 1893 he entered the studio of sculptor Auguste Rodin, who was to remain one of the chief influences of his artistic life. At that stage of his career, Bourdelle emulated the rugged realism of his mentor, Rodin. Bourdelle’s first major commission, a war memorial at Montauban, France (1902), exhibited a similarly brutal quality, as did the series of works inspired by the music of Beethoven that he also created during that period.
