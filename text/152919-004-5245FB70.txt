Hosea Ballou (1796–1861), nephew of the theologian Hosea Ballou (1771–1852), was joined by Universalist church members in founding Tufts College in 1852 and served as its first president. It was named for its original benefactor, Charles Tufts of Somerville. Women were first admitted in 1892 and were segregated in 1910 with the creation of Jackson College for Women; the physical separation of women and men, however lasted only until 1912. By the end of the 19th century the college had formed schools of medicine, dentistry, and graduate studies. Tufts was elevated to university status in 1955. Geologist Alfred Church Lane and physicist Allan M. Cormack served on the faculty, and poet John Ciardi and U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan are alumni.
