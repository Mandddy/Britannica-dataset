Sandarac, also spelled Sandarach,  brittle, faintly aromatic, translucent resin, usually available in the form of small, pale yellow, dusty tears; it is used as incense and in making a spirit varnish for coating paper, leather, and metal. The initial film is brittle, but it can readily be modified to yield elastic films by adding elemi, an oleoresin. Sandarac is obtained from the African sandarac tree, Tetraclinis articulata, or from cypress pines, genus Callitris, that grow in Australia, North Africa, and North America.
