Daphne,  genus of about 50 species of flowering shrubs of the mezereum family (Thymelaeaceae) native to Eurasia but widely cultivated for their form and flower clusters. The most popular species include low-growing evergreen types that are often grown in borders and rock gardens in mild climates. Among them is the spurge-laurel (D. laureola), with thick, glossy leaves and small greenish flowers near the ends of the branches. It produces poisonous black berries. The mezereon (D. mezereum) is a larger shrub, up to 1.5 m (5 feet), with deciduous leaves and spicy-fragrant pink flowers; the entire plant, including its bright-orange berries, is poisonous. The garland flower (D. cneorum) is a hardy evergreen trailing shrub, or ground cover, with pink, sweet-scented flowers. Popular greenhouse subjects include the several varieties of winter daphne (D. odora), which have very fragrant white to purplish flowers in crowded clusters. D. indica, with red blossoms, and D. japonica, with white or pinkish-purple flowers, are also grown as greenhouse evergreens.
