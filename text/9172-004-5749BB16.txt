Surrey,  popular American doorless, four-wheeled carriage of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Usually two-seated (for four passengers), surreys had a variety of tops, ranging from the rigid, fringed canopy-top, popularized in the Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein song “The Surrey with the Fringe on Top,” to parasol and extension tops.
Surreys were popular family vehicles, often used in the country. The surrey buckboard was constructed without axle springs.
