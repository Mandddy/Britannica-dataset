John Lothrop Motley,  (born April 15, 1814, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died  May 29, 1877, Dorchester, Dorset, Eng.) American diplomat and historian best remembered for The Rise of the Dutch Republic, a remarkable work of amateur scholarship that familiarized readers with the dramatic events of the Dutch revolt against Spanish rule in the 16th century.
Motley graduated from Harvard in 1831 and then studied law in Germany, returning to Boston in 1835. He was appointed secretary to the U.S. legation in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1841, and he later served as minister to Austria (1861–67) and Great Britain (1869–70). He published The Rise of the Dutch Republic in 1856. Motley viewed the Dutch revolt as a conflict between a democratic, tolerant, and rational Protestantism and the persecuting absolutism of Roman Catholic Spain. This work was a classic of popular history in the 19th century, though later scholarship modified Motley’s concept of the religious basis of the revolt to include constitutional and economic factors.
