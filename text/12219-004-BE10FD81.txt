Guillaume Dubois,  (born Sept. 6, 1656, Brive-la-Gallarde, Fr.—died  Aug. 10, 1723, Versailles) French cardinal, leading minister in the administration of Philippe II, duc d’Orléans (regent for King Louis XV from 1715 to 1723), and architect of the Anglo-French alliance that helped maintain peace in Europe from 1716 to 1733.
The son of a country doctor, Dubois studied for the priesthood before serving as tutor to the children of nobles who lived at the court of King Louis XIV. Among his pupils was Philippe, duc de Chartres, who succeeded to the title duc d’Orléans in 1701. When Orléans became regent for the five-year-old King Louis XV on the death of Louis XIV (Sept. 1, 1715), he made Dubois his secret adviser and envoy for foreign affairs.
