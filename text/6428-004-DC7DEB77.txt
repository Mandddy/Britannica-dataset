Julien Benda,  (born Dec. 26, 1867, Paris, France—died  June 7, 1956, Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris) novelist and philosopher, leader of the anti-Romantic movement in French criticism, persistent defender of reason and intellect against the philosophical intuitionism of Henri Bergson.
Benda graduated from the University of Paris in 1894. Among his first writings were articles (1898) on the Dreyfus affair. His lifelong assault on the philosophy of Bergson began with Le Bergsonisme in 1912. Literary fame came the same year with the publication of his first novel, L’Ordination (1911; The Yoke of Pity). In his most important work, La Trahison des clercs (1927; The Treason of the Intellectuals; also published as The Great Betrayal), Benda denounced as moral traitors those who betray truth and justice for racial and political considerations. The evolution of his thought can be traced in two autobiographical works: La Jeunesse d’un clerc (1937; “The Youth of an Intellectual”) and Un Régulier dans le siècle (1938; “A Regular in His Century”).
