Parachute, device that slows the vertical descent of a body falling through the atmosphere or the velocity of a body moving horizontally. The parachute increases the body’s surface area, and this increased air resistance slows the body in motion. Parachutes have found wide employment in war and peace for safely dropping supplies and equipment as well as personnel, and they are deployed for slowing a returning space capsule after reentry into Earth’s atmosphere. They are also used in the sport of skydiving.
The Shiji (Records of the Great Historian of China), by 2nd-century-bce Chinese scholar Sima Qian, includes the tale of a Chinese emperor who survived a jump from an upper story of a burning building by grasping conical straw hats in order to slow his descent. Though likely apocryphal, the story nonetheless demonstrates an understanding of the principle behind parachuting. A 13th-century Chinese manuscript contains a similar report of a thief who absconded with part of a statue by leaping from the tower where it was housed while holding two umbrellas. A report that actual parachutes were used at a Chinese emperor’s coronation ceremony in 1306 has not been substantiated by historical record. The first record of a parachute in the West occurred some two centuries later. A diagram of a pyramidal parachute, along with a brief description of the concept, is found in the Codex Atlanticus, a compilation of some 1,000 pages from Leonardo da Vinci’s notebooks (c. 1478–1518). However, there is no evidence suggesting that da Vinci ever actually constructed such a device.
