Battleship Potemkin, Russian Bronenosets Potyomkin,  Soviet silent film, released in 1925, that was director Sergey M. Eisensteinâ€™s tribute to the early Russian revolutionaries and is widely regarded as a masterpiece of international cinema.
The film is based on the mutiny of Russian sailors against their tyrannical superiors aboard the battleship Potemkin during the Revolution of 1905. Their victory was short-lived, however, as during their attempts to get the population of Odessa (now in Ukraine) to launch a massive revolution, Cossacks arrived and laid waste to the insurgents, thus fanning the winds of war that would ultimately lead to the rise of communism in the Revolution of 1917.
