Water moss, also called brook moss or fountain moss,  (Fontinalis), genus of mosses belonging to the subclass Bryidae, often found in flowing freshwater streams and ponds in temperate regions. Of the 20 species of water moss, 18 are native to North America. A brook moss may have shoots 30 to 100 (rarely up to 200) cm (12 to 40 inches) long and is usually attached to a stone or a tree root. The most common species, F. antipyretica, has long, slender branches covered with glossy, yellowish green or dark green phyllids (leaves), 4 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.25 inch) long and arranged in three ranks. Male and female reproductive organs are borne on separate plants.
