Dormer,  in architecture, a vertical window that projects from a sloping roof and usually illuminates a bedroom. The term derives from the Latin dormitorium, “sleeping room.” Dormers are set either on the face of the wall or high upon the roof, and their roofs may be gabled, hipped, flat, or with one slope. A small dormer in a roof or a spire is called a lucarne.
Simple dormers, frequently constructed in several rows, characterize the steep roofs of Teutonic countries. In the late Gothic and early Renaissance periods, more elaborate masonry dormers were designed that extended up from the wall line of the building and were richly decorated.
