Saʿūd, in full Saʿūd Ibn Abdul ʿazīz Al-fayṣal As-saʿūd   (born Jan. 15, 1902, Kuwait—died  Feb. 23, 1969, Athens, Greece) son and successor of Ibn Saʿūd, and king of Saudi Arabia from 1953 to 1964.
After Ibn Saʿūd had conquered (1925) the Hejaz, a district in the Arabian Peninsula, he made his two eldest sons, Saʿūd and Fayṣal, his deputies in Najd and Hejaz, respectively. Saʿūd’s primary responsibility was for the Bedouins. In 1933 he was named crown prince, and he and Fayṣal led a successful campaign against Yemen in the following year. When Ibn Saʿūd established a council of ministers in 1953, Saʿūd became its president, and in November of that year he became king with the support of his brothers.
