George Lucas, in full George Walton Lucas, Jr.   (born May 14, 1944, Modesto, California, U.S.) American motion-picture director, producer, and screenwriter who created several of the most popular films in history.
The son of a small-town stationer and a mother who was often hospitalized for long periods for ill health, Lucas was an early reader of classic adventure stories such as Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe and Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island, an avid collector of comic books, and a keen student of history. He became interested in filmmaking while in high school. He was also a car-racing fanatic as a teenager until a near-fatal crash at age 18 convinced him to give up the sport.
