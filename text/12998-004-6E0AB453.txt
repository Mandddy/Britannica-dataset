Cheng Huang, (
        Chinese: “Wall and Moat”) also known as Chenghuang Shen, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’eng Huang,  in Chinese mythology, the City God, or the spiritual magistrate and guardian deity of a particular Chinese city. Because dead spirits reputedly informed the god of all good and evil deeds within his jurisdiction, it was popularly believed that devout prayers offered in Cheng Huang’s temple would be liberally rewarded. The wide popularity of his cult was also due in part to imperial approbation. In 1382 his temples were appropriated by the government, and people were directed to offer sacrifices to the protector of their city.
Traditionally, before assuming a new post, local officials used to pass the night in Cheng Huang’s temple seeking guidance. When difficult problems of law later presented themselves, officials returned to the temple, in hopes that Cheng Huang would reveal the answer in a dream.
