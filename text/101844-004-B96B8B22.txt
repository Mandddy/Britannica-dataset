Michael Schumacher, byname Schumi  (born January 3, 1969, Hürth-Hermülhein, West Germany [now in Germany]) German race-car driver who set records for the most Formula One (F1) Grand Prix race victories and F1 series championships.
As a youth, Schumacher became interested in go-kart racing, an enthusiasm that was supported by his father’s management of a go-kart track. In 1984 and 1985 he won the German junior karting championship, and in 1987 he captured the German and European karting titles. The next year, at age 19, he left karting and became a driver of Formula Three (F3) cars, vehicles that were less powerful than the F1 racers. Two years later, in 1990, he won the German F3 championship.
