National Zoological Park, byname National Zoo,  zoo in Washington, D.C., that was established under the Smithsonian Institution by acts of the U.S. Congress in 1889 and 1890, when a site in the wooded valley of Rock Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River, was purchased. The Smithsonian was authorized to transfer to the zoo the animals kept in cages at the rear of the Smithsonian Institution. Various government departments, including the foreign consular service, donated specimens, and many exotic specimens have been received as gifts from foreign governments.
The zoo, which occupies about 76 hectares (187 acres), has approximately 5,000 specimens of more than 500 species. It has developed one of the worldâ€™s finest collections of small mammals and became famous for breeding pygmy hippopotamuses. Rarities include a white Bengal tiger and a pair of pandas (Mei Xiang and Tian Tian), a gift from China in 2000; the pandas Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, given by the Chinese in 1972, died in 1992 and 1999, respectively. A remodeling program in the 1960s resulted in the construction of an outstanding great flight cage and new hoofed-stock areas. A hospital-research building was added in 1970. In 1975 the zoo acquired 1,280 hectares (3,150 acres) in Front Royal, Virginia, to use as a conservation and research centre. The Cheetah Conservation Station, Reptile Discovery Center, and Amazonia (a re-creation of the Amazon rainforest) were among the zoo facilities that opened in the 1990s.
