Aloysius Bertrand, also called Louis Bertrand, in full Louis-Jacques-Napoléon Bertrand  (born April 20, 1807, Ceva, Piedmont [Italy]—died April 29, 1841, Paris, France) writer whose Gaspard de la nuit (“Gaspard of the Night”) introduced the prose poem into French literature and was a source of inspiration to the Symbolist poets and later to the Surrealists.
After his family settled in Dijon in 1815, Bertrand developed a consuming interest in the ancient Burgundian capital, joining the Société d’Études and collecting historical material, some of which he used in early poems published under the title Volupté (“Voluptuousness”). His contributions to a local newspaper, of which he was manager, won the favourable notice of the writers Victor Hugo and Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, and he was drawn to Paris, but he found no suitable employment there. Returning to Dijon, he wrote for a liberal newspaper until its suspension by the ordinances of Charles X against freedom of press and speech that provoked the July Revolution of 1830. For three years after the Revolution, he edited Le Patriote de la Côte d’Or.
