Pedro Menéndez de Avilés,  (born February 15, 1519, Avilés, Spain—died  September 17, 1574, Santander) Spaniard who founded St. Augustine, Florida, and was a classic example of the conquistador—intrepid, energetic, loyal, and brutal.
Born into the landed gentry, he ran away to sea at age 14. In 1549 he was commissioned by the Holy Roman emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) to drive pirates from the coasts of Spain. Five years later he was appointed captain of the Indies fleet. An impatient man who acted with dispatch and reluctantly concerned himself with administrative details, he made numerous enemies, who brought about his imprisonment in 1563. He was freed two years later after he had regained royal favour.
