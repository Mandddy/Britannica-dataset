Jackdaw, also called Daw,   (species Corvus monedula), crowlike black bird with gray nape and pearly eyes of the family Corvidae (order Passeriformes). Jackdaws, which are 33 cm (13 inches) long, breed in colonies in tree holes, cliffs, and tall buildings: their flocks fly in formation around the site. They lay four to six light, greenish blue eggs that are spotted and blotched. The bird’s cry sounds like its name: “chak.” The species ranges from the British Isles to central Asia; eastward it is replaced by the white-breasted, white-collared Daurian jackdaw (C. dauuricus).
In the United States a species of grackle is sometimes called a jackdaw.
