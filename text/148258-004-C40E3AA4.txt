Gavin Maxwell,  (born July 15, 1914, Elrig, near Mochrum, Wigtown, Scot.—died  Sept. 6, 1969, Inverness, Inverness) Scottish author and naturalist.
Maxwell was educated at Stowe School and the University of Oxford, then became a freelance journalist, though ornithology remained his special interest. He served with the Scots Guard in World War II. In 1945 he bought the island of Soay and described in Harpoon at a Venture (1952; also published as Harpoon Venture) his attempt to establish a shark fishery there. The best-selling Ring of Bright Water (1960) describes his life with two pet otters in his seaboard cottage in the west Highlands of Scotland; The Rocks Remain (1963) is a sequel. Maxwell’s prolonged stay in Sicily resulted in two fine books, God Protect Me from My Friends (1956; also published as Bandit), about the bandit Salvatore Giuliano, and The Pains of Death (1959), on the poverty-stricken lives of the islanders. A Reed Shaken by the Wind (1957; also published as People of the Reeds) is an account of his travels among the marsh dwellers of southern Iraq.
