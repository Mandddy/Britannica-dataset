Jules Dalou, in full Aimé-Jules Dalou  (born Dec. 31, 1838, Paris, France—died April 15, 1902, Paris) French sculptor noted for allegorical group compositions of Baroque inspiration and for simpler studies of common people, representative of the naturalist trend in French sculpture.
Dalou’s chief mentor was Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, who encouraged his training first, and briefly, at the Petite (“Little”) École—where Dalou absorbed the lively, eclectic idiom of the school that was his true training ground—and later at the École des Beaux-Arts, where he studied for three years. His earliest works, for Paris townhouses, reveal the mastery of craft, sinuous anatomy, and design that characterize his entire oeuvre. His most notable Parisian monuments include the bronze Triumph of the Republic (1879–99) at the Place de la Nation and the memorial to painter Eugène Delacroix in the Luxembourg Gardens (1890). Two bronze gisants—Auguste Blanqui (1885) and Victor Noir (1890), both in Père-Lachaise Cemetery, Paris—became popular pilgrimage and rallying sites for political liberals. Dalou’s later smaller sculptures reveal an increasing sympathy with the compassionate view of human life and toil found in the paintings of Jean-François Millet. Representative of this approach are several mother-and-child groups and the terra-cotta figures of workers (Petit Palais, Paris) for a projected Monument to the Workers (c. 1889–98).
