Christopher Hitchens, in full Christopher Eric Hitchens  (born April 13, 1949, Portsmouth, England—died December 15, 2011, Houston, Texas, U.S.) British American author, critic, and bon vivant whose trenchant polemics on politics and religion positioned him at the forefront of public intellectual life in the late 20th and early 21st century.
Hitchens, the son of a commander in the Royal Navy, spent his early childhood in itinerant fashion, with stays in Malta and in Rosyth, Scotland. His mother emphasized education as an entrée into the upper echelons of society. At her insistence, Hitchens was sent to boarding school at an early age, eventually attending The Leys School, Cambridge. In 1967 he enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford, where he joined the International Socialists, a Trotskyist sect. Though an adamant leftist, Hitchens cultivated connections across the political spectrum, a tendency that incurred opprobrium from his more doctrinaire compatriots. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 1970 and moved to London, where he wrote for the Times Higher Education Supplement.
