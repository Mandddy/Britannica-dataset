Fusarium wilt, widespread plant disease caused by many forms of the soil-inhabiting fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Several hundred plant species are susceptible, including economically important food crops such as sweet potatoes, tomatoes, legumes, melons, and bananas (in which the infection is known as Panama disease). F. oxysporum thrives at soil temperatures above 24 °C (75 °F) and can live indefinitely in soil without access to living host plants. Infected plants are usually stunted; their leaves turn pale green to golden yellow and later wilt, wither, die, and drop off progressively upward from the stem base. Dark streaks occur in the xylem vascular tissue of the roots and lower stem, and the roots may decay. Infected seedlings wilt and die.
The spread of the pathogen can be somewhat controlled by using clean seeds and removing infected plant tissues from the area, though the most effective management strategy is to plant resistant varieties. Depending on the forma specialis (host-specific form) responsible for a given infection, the disease can sometimes be controlled with soil fungicides, though some forms have developed resistance. Given its longevity, crop rotation is generally ineffective.
