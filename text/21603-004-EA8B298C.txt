Julia Ward Howe, née Julia Ward   (born May 27, 1819, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 17, 1910, Newport, Rhode Island) American author and lecturer best known for her “Battle Hymn of the Republic.”
Julia Ward came of a well-to-do family and was educated privately. In 1843 she married educator Samuel Gridley Howe and took up residence in Boston. Always of a literary bent, she published her first volume of poetry, Passion Flowers, in 1854; this and subsequent works—including a poetry collection, Words for the Hour (1857), a play, Leonora; or, the World’s Own, produced in 1857, and A Trip to Cuba (1860)—had little success.
