Juan de Herrera,  (born c. 1530, Mobellán, Spain—died January 15, 1597, Madrid) architect, principal designer of the monumental Escorial, a structure that expressed the ideals of imperial Spain in the 16th century. Serving as the royal inspector of monuments, he witnessed the imitation of the Herreran style in churches and palaces throughout Spain.
After studying at the University of Valladolid, Herrera accompanied King Philip II of Spain to Italy and Brussels (1547–51) as a courtier, and from 1551 to 1559 he was with the king in Italy and at Yuste, Spain. In 1563 he was appointed assistant to Juan Bautista de Toledo at El Escorial, and in 1572 he was appointed head architect. Herrera reorganized the workshops, completed the roofs, added a section to the west facade, designed the church (1574–82), and built the infirmary. He later worked at the summer palace at Aranjuez (after 1567), at the Exchange in Sevilla (after 1582), and at the Cathedral of Valladolid (after 1585).
