William Gifford,  (born April 1756, Ashburton, Devonshire, Eng.—died  Dec. 31, 1826, London) English satirical poet, classical scholar, and early editor of 17th-century English playwrights, best known as the first editor (1809–24) of the Tory Quarterly Review, founded to combat the liberalism of the Whig Edinburgh Review. Gifford owed his editorship to his connection with the statesman George Canning on The Anti-Jacobin (1797–98), a weekly of which he had been editor and in which Canning and other Tories had ridiculed revolutionary principles.
Gifford was hostile to new developments in this era of rapid literary innovation, and he offended eminent contributors by rewriting their literary reviews to introduce political abuse. He so provoked William Hazlitt, a leading radical critic, that Hazlitt attacked Gifford in A Letter to William Gifford, Esq. (1819) and immortalized him in a portrait etched in vitriol in The Spirit of the Age (1825).
