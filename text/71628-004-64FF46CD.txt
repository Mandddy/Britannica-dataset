The Miracle Worker, American dramatic biopic, released in 1962, that presented the life of Helen Keller and her teacher Annie (or Anne) Sullivan; it earned Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke Academy Awards for best actress and supporting actress, respectively.
The Miracle Worker—which was based on a Tony Award-winning play by William Gibson, who also wrote the screenplay—recounts the early years of Keller (played by Duke). It highlights her remarkable achievements despite her blindness and deafness and shows the indefatigable efforts of her teacher (Bancroft) to connect with the frustrated and recalcitrant young girl.
