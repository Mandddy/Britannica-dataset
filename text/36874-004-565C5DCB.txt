Nikolay Mikhaylovich Karamzin,  (born Dec. 12 [Dec. 1, Old Style], 1766, Mikhaylovka, Simbirsk [now Ulyanovsk] province, Russia—died  June 3 [May 22], 1826, St. Petersburg) Russian historian, poet, and journalist who was the leading exponent of the sentimentalist school in Russian literature.
From an early age, Karamzin was interested in Enlightenment philosophy and western European literature. After extensive travel in western Europe, Karamzin described his impressions in his Pisma russkogo puteshestvennika Letters of a Russian Traveller, 1789–1790), the most important of his contributions to a monthly review, Moskovsky zhurnal (1791–92; “Moscow Journal”), that he founded on his return. Written in a self-revealing style influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Laurence Sterne, the “Letters” helped introduce to Russia the sentimental style then popular in western Europe. Karamzin’s tale “Bednaya Liza” (1792; “Poor Liza”), about a village girl who commits suicide after a tragic love affair, soon became the most celebrated work of the Russian sentimental school.
