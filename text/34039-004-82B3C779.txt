Louis-Honoré Fréchette,  (born Nov. 16, 1839, Lévis, Que.—died  May 31, 1908, Montreal) preeminent French Canadian poet of the 19th century, noted for his patriotic poems.
Fréchette studied law at Laval University, Quebec, and was admitted to the bar in 1864. Discharged as a journalist for liberal views, he went to Chicago (1866–71). There, he wrote La Voix d’un exilé (1866–68; “The Voice of an Exile”), a poem attacking the political and clerical dealings in Quebec in that period of Canadian confederation and voicing a patriotic idealization of the French republic. Returning to Lévis in 1871, Fréchette entered politics, representing that city in the federal House of Commons (1874–78) and from 1889 until his death acting as clerk of the provincial Legislative Council in Quebec City.
