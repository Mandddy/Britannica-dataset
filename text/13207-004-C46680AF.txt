Ballet movement, in classical ballet, any of the formalized actions of a dancer that follow specific rules regarding the positions of the arms, feet, and body. Ballet choreography is based on combinations of these fundamental movements. Some movements, like the plié and battement, are training exercises designed to give strength and flexibility to the entire body while helping the dancer acquire perfect posture, or “placement,” with the weight lightly balanced over the centre of gravity and the legs turned out from the hip sockets. Other movements are steps in a ballet. These may be jumping or leaping steps (pas d’élévation), like the entrechat (a jump beginning and ending in the fifth position, during which the feet are rapidly crossed) or the jeté (a jump in which the weight is transferred from one foot to the other); or they may be turns (tours), such as the pirouette (a turn on one foot) and the tour en l’air (a complete single, double, or triple, turn in the air).
