Odilon Barrot, in full Camille-hyacinthe-odilon Barrot   (born July 19, 1791, Villefort, France—died  Aug. 6, 1873, Bougival) prominent liberal monarchist under the July Monarchy in France (1830–48) and a leader of the electoral reform movement of 1847.
Barrot began his career in 1814 as a barrister in the Court of Cassation. After making his name as a defender of liberals, he was elected president of the society Aide-toi, le ciel t’aidera (“Heaven helps those who help themselves”), an organization for promoting resistance, by legal means, against the reactionary government of the Bourbon Restoration. During the July Revolution (1830), Barrot supported the proclamation of Louis-Philippe as king of the French and was one of the three commissioners of the new government who escorted the former king, Charles X, to Cherbourg on his way into exile.
