Tōgō Heihachirō, in full (from 1934) Kōshaku (Marquess) Tōgō Heihachirō  (born Jan. 27, 1848, Kagoshima, Japan—died May 30, 1934, Tokyo) admiral who led the Japanese fleet to victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05). In the process, he developed new tactics for engaging an advancing enemy fleet.
Tōgō studied naval science in England from 1871 to 1878. After returning to Japan, he served in a number of naval posts and rose in the officer ranks. He was in command of a warship during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 that sank a British merchant ship carrying Chinese troops, which sparked a brief international incident. In December 1903 he was appointed commander in chief of the combined Japanese fleet and was made an admiral the following year on the eve of war with Russia.
