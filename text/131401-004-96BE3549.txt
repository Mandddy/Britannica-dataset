Battle of Quebec, also called Battle of the Plains of Abraham,  (September 13, 1759), in the French and Indian War, decisive defeat of the French under the marquis de Montcalm by a British force led by Maj. Gen. James Wolfe. Both commanding officers died from wounds sustained during the battle, and within a year French Canada had capitulated to British forces. With the end of hostilities in 1763, France surrendered virtually all of its colonial possessions in North America.
The French and Indian War was the North American phase of the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), which was also fought in Europe and India. On one side was the alliance of France, Austria, Sweden, Saxony, Russia, and Spain; on the other, the alliance of Britain, Prussia, and Hanover. While France was occupied by Frederick the Great and his Prussian armies in Europe, Britain attacked the French navy and merchant fleet in the hope of destroying France as a commercial rival.
