Francis Egerton, 3rd duke of Bridgewater, Bridgewater also spelled Bridgwater   (born May 21, 1736, Worsley, Lancashire, Eng.—died  March 8, 1803, London) founder of British inland navigation, whose canal, built from his estates at Worsley to the city of Manchester, is called the Bridgewater canal.
His father, who was created duke in 1720, was the great-great-grandson of Lord Chancellor Ellesmere. Francis Egerton succeeded to the dukedom on the death of his brother, the 2nd duke, in 1748. Retiring to Worsley after a broken engagement, he instructed the engineer James Brindley to construct the canal for the transport of coal obtained on his estates. This, with the exception of the Sankey Canal from the River Mersey to St. Helen’s, was the first canal of its kind to be built in modern Britain. Bridgewater also obtained parliamentary powers (1762) to provide a canal between Manchester and Liverpool.
