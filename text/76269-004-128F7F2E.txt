Mary Astor, original name Lucille Vasconcellos Langhanke  (born May 3, 1906, Quincy, Ill., U.S.—died September 25, 1987, Woodland Hills, Calif.) American motion-picture and stage actress noted for her delicate, classic beauty and a renowned profile that earned her the nickname “The Cameo Girl.” With the ability to play a variety of characters ranging from villains to heroines to matrons, Astor worked in film from the silent era to the 1960s.
Astor’s early career was directed by her German-immigrant father, who entered her into a beauty contest at age 14; a year later she appeared in her first film, Sentimental Tommy (1921), although her role was cut from the release print. After a few bit parts in two-reelers, Astor was selected by John Barrymore to costar in Beau Brummel (1924). The two also began a lively, romantic offscreen relationship, with the legendary, 40-year-old Barrymore helping to hone the teenage Astor’s natural acting gifts. After the affair ended, Astor starred again with Barrymore in Don Juan (1926), the first silent movie with sound-on-disc Vitaphone music and sound effects. Perfecting her vocal technique in several stage productions, Astor made a successful transition to talkies.
