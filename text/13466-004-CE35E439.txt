Thomism, the theology and philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas (1224/25–1274) and its various interpretations, usages, and invocations by individuals, religious orders, and schools. Thomism’s rich history may be divided into four main periods: the first two centuries after his death (the 14th and 15th centuries), the 16th century, the period from about 1850 to the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), and the period from the Second Vatican Council to the present.
Aquinas achieved an original synthesis of Aristotelian philosophy and Christian theology. Building upon Aristotle but also making respectful use of the Neoplatonic doctrines of St. Augustine (354–430) and the Church Fathers (the bishops and other teachers who expounded orthodox Christianity in the early centuries of the church), Aquinas developed a distinctive position. He treated existence as the supreme act or perfection of being in God as well as in created things, reserved the creative act to God alone, denied the presence of matter in angels, and thus distinguished between God and created beings by positing that only in created beings is existence distinct from essence. Also characteristic was his teaching that the human soul is a unique subsistent form, substantially united with matter to constitute human nature. Aquinas maintained that the immortality of the human soul can be strictly demonstrated, that there is a real distinction of principles between the soul and its powers of knowing and willing, and that human knowledge is based upon sense experience leading to the mind’s reflective activity. He held that both human beings and lower creatures have a natural tendency or love toward God, that supernatural grace perfects and elevates the natural abilities of humans, and that blessedness consists formally in knowing God himself, a knowledge accompanied by full love of God.
