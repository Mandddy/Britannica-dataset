Wicklow, Irish Cill Mhantáin,  county in the province of Leinster, eastern Ireland. It is bounded by Counties Wexford (south), Carlow and Kildare (west), and South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown (north) and by the Irish Sea (east). The town of Wicklow is the county seat, and there is a county manager.
County Wicklow includes much of the Leinster Chain mountain range, notably the Wicklow Mountains, and has fertile lowland areas. Much of its coast comprises rocky cliffs and excellent sand beaches. The main summits of the Leinster Chain are above 2,000 feet (600 metres), with Lugnaquillia Mountain the highest at 3,039 feet (926 metres); in places it is marked by waterfalls and river gorges. South of Lugnaquillia the range is not a significant barrier, but the Wicklow Mountains are nowhere crossed at an elevation of less than 1,000 feet (300 metres); the Military Road through the mountains, built after a rebellion in 1798, runs at an elevation of more than 1,000 feet for more than 20 miles (30 km).
