Cross-country skiing, skiing in open country over rolling, hilly terrain as found in Scandinavian countries, where the sport originated as a means of travel as well as recreation and where it remains popular. In its noncompetitive form the sport is also known as ski touring.
The skis used are longer, narrower, and lighter than those used in more-mountainous, Alpine-type terrain. In addition, the bindings allow movement between the heel of the skier’s boot and the ski, and the ski poles are longer than those used in Alpine skiing. There are two techniques of cross-country skiing. Using the older classical technique, a skier travels with skis parallel and kicking backward to create a gliding motion across the snow. The more-recent skating, or freestyle, technique, developed in the 1970s, closely resembles the motions of ice skating. With this technique the skier pushes the inside edge of the ski simultaneously backward and outward at about a 45° angle, thereby generating more speed than with the classical style.
