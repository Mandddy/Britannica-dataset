Stegosaurus (genus Stegosaurus), one of the various plated dinosaurs (Stegosauria) of the Late Jurassic Period (159 million to 144 million years ago) recognizable by its spiked tail and series of large triangular bony plates along the back. Stegosaurus usually grew to a length of about 6.5 metres (21 feet), but some reached 9 metres (30 feet). The skull and brain were very small for such a large animal. The forelimbs were much shorter than the hind limbs, which gave the back a characteristically arched appearance. The feet were short and broad.
Various hypotheses have attempted to explain the arrangement and use of the plates. Paleontologists had long thought that Stegosaurus had two parallel rows of plates, either staggered or paired, and that these afforded protection to the animalâ€™s backbone and spinal cord. However, new discoveries and reexamination of existing Stegosaurus specimens since the 1970s suggest that the plates alternated along the backbone, as no two plates from the same animal have exactly the same shape or size. Because the plates contained many blood vessels, the alternating placement appears consistent with a hypothesis of thermoregulation. This hypothesis proposes that the plates acted as radiators, releasing body heat to a cooler ambient environment; conversely, the plates could also have collected heat by being faced toward the sun like living solar panels.
