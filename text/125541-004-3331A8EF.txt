Papuan languages, group of languages spoken in New Guinea and its surrounds. The area includes the entire island of New Guinea and the offshore islands of New Britain, New Ireland, Sorenarwa (Yapen), and Biak, as well as the adjoining areas of eastern Indonesia, especially the islands of Timor, Alor, and Halmahera. Some 1,100 languages—about a quarter of the world’s known languages—are spoken in this region. These include the approximately 800 Papuan languages as well as some 300 Austronesian languages.
Unlike the Austronesian languages, the Papuan languages do not constitute a single, genetically unified language family (hence they are often referred to by a common negative characterization, Non-Austronesian). Instead, they are organized into several dozen different language families. Comparative work will undoubtedly combine some of these families into larger genetic groupings, just as the Celtic, Germanic, and Slavic families were eventually combined with others to form the Indo-European language family. At the beginning of the 21st century, however, such claims were still speculative in regard to Papuan languages.
