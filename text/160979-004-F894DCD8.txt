Ludvig Holberg, Baron Holberg,  (born December 3, 1684, Bergen, Norway—died January 28, 1754, Copenhagen, Denmark) the outstanding Scandinavian literary figure of the Enlightenment period, claimed by both Norway and Denmark as one of the founders of their literatures.
Orphaned as a child, Holberg lived with relatives in Bergen until the city was destroyed by fire in 1702, when he was sent to the University of Copenhagen. Longing to see the world, he set out for Holland (1704) after taking his degree, but he fell ill at Aachen and, having few resources, had to make his way back to Norway on foot. After working as a French tutor, he set out again in 1706 for London and Oxford, where he studied for two years, supporting himself by giving lessons on the flute and violin. While there, he must have begun his Introduction til de fornemste europæiske rigers historie (“Introduction to the History of Leading European Nations”), which was not published until 1711, when he was back in Denmark. It led to his receiving a royal grant that permitted him to study and travel.
