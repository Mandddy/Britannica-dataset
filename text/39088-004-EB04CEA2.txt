Sika (Cervus nippon), small, forest-dwelling deer of the family Cervidae (order Artiodactyla), which is native to China, Korea, and Japan, where it was long considered sacred. (Sika means “deer” in Japanese.) It is farmed in China for its antlers, which are used in traditional medicine.
Mature males of the smallest forms, the southern sikas, stand 80–86 cm (31–34 inches) at the shoulder and weigh about 80 kg (180 pounds). Males of the largest forms, the northern sikas, such as Dybowski’s sika (C. nippon hortulorum), stand approximately 110 cm (40 inches) at the shoulder and weigh 110 kg (240 pounds). Females weigh about 60 percent as much as males. Their coats are reddish brown and spotted in summer and dark brown and sometimes without spots in winter. There is considerable geographic variation in size, coat characteristics, and colour. All have fairly long tails and a white rump patch rimmed by long white hair that can be flared wide in alarm. All mature stags grow a neck ruff in fall. The four-tined antlers of older stags may exceed 85 cm (33 inches) in length in the north and 70 cm (28 inches) in the south.
