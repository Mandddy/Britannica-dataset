The Red Shoes, British dance film, released in 1948, based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of the same title. Though not immediately acclaimed on its release, the movie grew in stature, and today it is widely considered the best film made about the world of dance.
The Andersen story is a morbid fairy tale about a ballerina whose shoes force her to dance to the point of death; she is saved only by having her feet cut off. The film traces a love triangle between ballerina Victoria Page (played by Moira Shearer), her beau, and her art, represented by the director (Anton Walbrook), who demands that she give up romance in order to pursue stardom with his ballet company. At the movie’s centre is a renowned 17-minute ballet, danced by Shearer, based on Andersen’s tale.
