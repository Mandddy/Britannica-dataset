Coffee, beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plant of African origin. Coffee is one of the three most-popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most-profitable international commodities. Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee.
Two species of the coffee plant, Coffea arabica and C. canephora, supply almost all of the world’s consumption. Arabica is considered a milder, more-flavourful and aromatic brew than Robusta, the main variety of C. canephora. The flatter and more-elongated Arabica bean is more widespread than Robusta but more delicate and vulnerable to pests, requiring a cool subtropical climate; it must grow at higher elevations (2,000–6,500 feet [600–2,000 metres]) and requires a lot of moisture, sun, and shade. Latin America, eastern Africa, Asia, and Arabia are leading producers of Arabica coffee. The rounder, more-convex Robusta bean, as its name suggests, is heartier and can grow at lower altitudes (from sea level to 2,000 feet). Robusta coffee is cheaper to produce, has twice the caffeine content of Arabica, and is typically the bean of choice for inexpensive commercial coffee brands. Western and central Africa, Southeast Asia, and Brazil are major producers of Robusta coffee.
