Ignace Joseph Pleyel, also spelled Ignaz Josef Pleyel   (born June 18, 1757, Ruppersthal, Austria—died  Nov. 14, 1831, Paris, France) Austro-French composer, music publisher, and piano builder.
Trained in music while still a very young child, he was sent in 1772 to Eisenstadt to become a pupil and lodger of Joseph Haydn’s. Pleyel later claimed a close, warm relationship had existed between them, and there is evidence of the master’s esteem for his student’s compositional talents in the overture (or at least the first two movements) of Haydn’s puppet opera Das abgebrannte Haus (1776?), now generally accepted as being Pleyel’s work. His first position was probably as Kapellmeister to Count Erdödy at Pressburg, to whom he gratefully dedicated his string quartets, Opus 1 (1782–83). By 1784 Pleyel had become an assistant Kapellmeister at Strasbourg Cathedral, succeeding as principal Kapellmeister when his predecessor died in 1789. In 1786 he also organized and conducted a series of public concerts, which provided him with additional opportunities to popularize his compositions.
