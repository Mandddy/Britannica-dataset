Han River, Chinese (Pinyin and Wade-Giles romanization) Han Shui ,  one of the most important tributaries of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) of China. It has a total length of about 950 miles (1,530 km). The Han River rises in the Shenqiong Mountains, part of the Micang Mountains in the extreme southwestern part of Shaanxi province. Its upper stream is known successively as the Yudai, the Yang, and, below Mianxian, the Mian. At Hanzhong it becomes the Han River. It flows eastward at the foot of the Qin (Tsinling) Mountains, receiving from the north various tributaries (of which the Xun River is the largest) and a large number of north-flowing tributaries arising in the Daba Mountains to the south. This upper valley of the Han River is mostly rugged and mountainous, but around Hanzhong is a fertile alluvial basin some 60 miles (100 km) long and 12 miles (19 km) wide. Below Ankang the river cuts through a series of deep gorges and emerges eventually into the central Yangtze basin at Guanghua (Laohekou) above Yunxian in Hubei province.
The lower course of the Han River flows through a rich lowland. The course changes frequently, and the area is so flat that a small change in the level of the river may inundate a considerable area, and extensive dikes are required. Above Xiangfan at Jun Xian, where the Han receives the Dan River, a dam completed in 1970 stabilizes the water flow, prevents flooding, extends the range of navigation, and permits irrigation. Several hydroelectric generators are also in operation on the site. Farther downstream at Xiangfan the river receives its largest tributary, the Baishui River. In the 1950s, in order to prevent flooding, a large retention basin was built at the confluence with the Baishui to accumulate floodwaters and to regulate the flow of the Han itself; four extensive irrigation projects were also built in the area.
