Sports Illustrated, weekly sports magazine that originated in 1954 and was developed by Henry Luce, the creator of Time magazine. Published by Time Inc. (a division of Time Warner Inc.), Sports Illustrated is headquartered in New York City.
Luce started Sports Illustrated as an attempt to diversify the publications owned by Time Inc. The first issues, however, lacked focus, covering both popular spectator sports and elite activities such as rugby; as a result, the magazine struggled in its early years. After 1960, when Andre Laguerre took over as managing editor, Sports Illustrated focused on premier sporting events, allowing people to read more about what they had seen on television or read about in newspapers. Laguerre was thus able to gain millions of new readers and generate billions of dollars in profit. With Laguerre at the helm, Sports Illustrated began to feature both high-calibre photography and outstanding sports journalism. The magazine also published occasional pieces by such literary giants as William Saroyan, Robert Frost, and William Faulkner.
