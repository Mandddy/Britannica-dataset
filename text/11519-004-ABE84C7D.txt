Geuzen, (Dutch), French Gueux,  the largely Calvinist Dutch guerrilla and privateering forces whose military actions initiated the Netherlands’ revolt against Spanish rule (1568–1609). The term was first applied derisively to the lesser nobility who, together with some of the great Netherlands magnates, in 1566 petitioned Margaret of Parma, governor-general of the Netherlands, to relax the religious persecution against Protestants. Receiving partial satisfaction of their grievances, the nobles, led by Hendrik van Brederode, gladly accepted the title of Geuzen (“Beggars”).
In 1567, however, Margaret’s Spanish successor, the duque de Alba, entered the Netherlands to restore the total power of King Philip II, and many dissidents fled abroad. Large numbers of these exiles returned in the next few years and formed land and naval contingents and, by the end of 1573, had secured the maritime provinces of Holland and Zeeland against Spanish attack.
