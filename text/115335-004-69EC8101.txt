Russell Hoban, in full Russell Conwell Hoban  (born February 4, 1925, Lansdale, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died December 13, 2011, London, England) American novelist and children’s writer who combined myth, fantasy, humour, and philosophy to explore issues of self-identity.
Hoban attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art and served in the U.S. Army (1943–45) before beginning his career as an advertising artist and copywriter. He moved to London in 1969. His first book, What Does It Do and How Does It Work? (1959), developed from his drawings of construction machinery. He then started writing fiction for children. One of his most enduring creations is the anthropomorphic badger Frances, who is featured with her family and friends in a series of books beginning with Bedtime for Frances (1960). Fear and mortality intrude on the fantasy story The Mouse and His Child (1967; filmed 1977), one of Hoban’s best-known books. His other notable works for children include The Sorely Trying Day (1964), Charlie the Tramp (1967), Emmet Otter’s Jug-Band Christmas (1971), How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen (1974), Dinner at Alberta’s (1975), Jim Hedgehog and the Lonesome Tower (1992), M.O.L.E.: Much Overworked Little Earthmover (1993), Trouble on Thunder Mountain (1999), and Jim’s Lion (2001). Before 1971 most of Hoban’s books for children were illustrated by his first wife, Lillian Hoban.
