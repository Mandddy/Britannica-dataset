Henri Pousseur,  (born July 23, 1929, Malmédy, Belg.—died March 6, 2009, Brussels) Belgian composer whose works encompass a variety of 20th-century musical styles. He wrote music for many different combinations of performers as well as for electronic instruments, alone or with live performers.
Pousseur studied at the Liège Conservatory from 1947 to 1952 and the Brussels Conservatory from 1952 to 1953. Influenced by such composers as Anton Webern, he wrote serial music, in which various musical elements are rigidly controlled. Yet he also composed aleatory music, involving many types of highly unpredictable events. In Répons pour sept musiciens (1960; “Responses for Seven Musicians”), the course of the composition is partly determined by lottery and by the players’ free choice based on moves on a checkerboard. In Pousseur’s operalike Le Miroire de votre Faust (1961–68; “The Mirror of Your Faust”), the Faust story is given new twists; which one of four possible denouements a particular performance presents is determined by audience vote.
