Carpenter bee (subfamily Xylocopinae), any of a group of small bees in the family Anthophoridae (order Hymenoptera) that are found in most areas of the world. The small carpenter bee, Ceratina, is about six millimetres long and of metallic coloration. It nests in plant stems, which the female first hollows out and then packs with pollen and eggs. A number of individual cells are placed in a row, separated by thin partitions of wood debris mixed with saliva. The large carpenter bee, Xylocopa, somewhat resembles the bumblebee but differs in having a nonhairy abdomen and in its habit of nesting in a tunnel excavated within solid wood. Xylocopa are often considered pests because of their tunneling in structural wood such as that of buildings and fences.
