Carl Auer, Freiherr von Welsbach,  (born Sept. 1, 1858, Viennaâ€”died  Aug. 4, 1929, Treibach, Austria) Austrian chemist and engineer who invented the gas mantle, thus allowing the greatly increased output of light by gas lamps.
In 1885 Welsbach discovered and isolated the elements neodymium and praseodymium from a mixture called didymium, which was previously considered an element. His interest in rare-earth elements continued, and he found that a fabric impregnated with a mixture of thorium nitrate and cerium nitrate could be made into a mantle that glowed brightly when heated by a gas flame. Patented in 1885, the Welsbach mantle greatly improved gas lighting and, although largely supplanted by the incandescent lamp, is still widely used in kerosene and other lanterns.
