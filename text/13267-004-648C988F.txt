Babirusa,  (Babirousa babyrussa), wild East Indian swine, family Suidae (order Artiodactyla), of Celebes and the Molucca islands.
The stout-bodied, short-tailed babirusa stands 65–80 cm (25–30 inches) at the shoulder. It has a rough, grayish hide and is almost hairless. Its most notable feature is the exaggerated development of the upper and lower canine teeth, or tusks, of the male. Those of the upper jaw grow upward from their bases so that they pierce the skin of the muzzle and curve backward, eventually almost touching the forehead.
