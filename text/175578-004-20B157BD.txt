The Wild One, American dramatic film, released in 1953, that was deemed scandalous for its day. Marlon Brando’s portrayal of a brooding biker in a black leather jacket helped launch both the film and an international interest in motorcycle gangs such as the Hell’s Angels.
The plot is loosely based on a 1947 incident in which the town of Hollister, California, was inundated by biker gangs. In the film, Brando and Lee Marvin played rival gang leaders Johnny and Chino, respectively. After Chino is arrested by a small-town sheriff (played by Robert Keith), his gang goes on a rampage. When Johnny is seen attempting to escort the sheriff’s daughter out of harm’s way, his actions are misconstrued by the enraged townspeople. Though he is eventually exonerated of any wrongdoing, the film does not offer a true happy ending.
