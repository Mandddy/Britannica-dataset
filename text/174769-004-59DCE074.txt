La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc, (
        French: “The Passion of Joan of Arc”) French silent film, released in 1928, that was an acclaimed and historically accurate account of the trial and execution of Saint Joan of Arc in 1431.
The inventive film is a sober, intelligent drama detailing the last weeks in the life of Saint Joan of Arc (played by Maria Falconetti), who sought to save France from English conquest. After her capture by the Burgundians, she was sold to the English and tried for witchcraft and heresy. Her courageous stand led to her torture, and she was later burned at the stake.
