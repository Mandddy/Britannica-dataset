Gael García Bernal,  (born October 30, 1978, Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico) Mexican actor and director who became known for his work in films that portrayed men and women in taboo or nonconformist relationships.
García Bernal’s parents—his mother was an actress and his father a director—involved him in theatrical productions at an early age. In 1989 he was cast in a Mexican telenovela, and in 1996 he appeared in the short film De tripas, corazón (“Take Courage”). When he was 17 years old, García Bernal traveled to Europe and won a scholarship to the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. In the middle of his studies, he returned to Mexico to film Amores perros (2000; “Love’s a Bitch”) with director Alejandro González Iñárritu. García Bernal’s performance as a poor teenager who turns to dogfighting to finance an affair with his sister-in-law won rave reviews and launched his career. Amores perros was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film and brought García Bernal to the attention of another acclaimed Mexican director, Alfonso Cuarón, who cast the young actor as a colead in the coming-of-age film Y tu mamá también (2001; “And Your Mother Too”). The movie, which followed two adolescent boys and an older woman on a road trip through Mexico, aroused controversy with its frank depiction of the sexual relationship between the three primary characters.
