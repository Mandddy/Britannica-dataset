Scorpion fish, any of the numerous bottom-living marine fish of the family Scorpaenidae, especially those of the genus Scorpaena, widely distributed in temperate and tropical waters. Sometimes also called rockfish, or stonefish, because they commonly live among rocks, scorpion fish are perchlike fish with large, spiny heads and strong, sometimes venomous, fin spines. The fin spines, with or without venom, can produce deep and painful wounds.
Many scorpion fish are rather dull in colour, but others are brighterâ€”often some shade of red. The largest members of the family grow about 1 metre (39 inches) long. Scorpion fish are carnivorous, generally sedentary fish. They often lie quietly on the bottom, and many blend closely with their surroundings by virtue of their colouring and (in some species) a variety of flaps and projections on the head and body. Better-known species include the redfish and the highly coloured, venomous lion-fish.
