Broiling, cooking by exposing food to direct radiant heat, either on a grill over live coals or below a gas burner or electric coil. Broiling differs from roasting and baking in that the food is turned during the process so as to cook one side at a time. Temperatures are higher for broiling than for roasting; the broil indicator of a household range is typically set around 550 °F (288 °C), whereas larger commercial appliances broil between 700 and 1,000 °F (371 and 538 °C).
Fish, fowl, and most red meats are suitable for broiling. Steaks, popularly broiled over coals, can also be broiled in skillets or in the oven set on a seasoned wooden plank. In preparation of the entrée known as the London broil, or London mixed grill, flank steaks and other meats are garnished with vinegar, oil, and minced garlic before being placed on a rack and oven-broiled.
