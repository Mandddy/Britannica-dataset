Evoluon, in full Evoluon Eindhoven,  former science and technology museum in Eindhoven, Netherlands, that opened in 1966 to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the company Philips. In 1989 the museum closed, and the building later became a conference centre.
In 1963 work began on the Evoluonâ€™s striking building, a mushroom-shaped structure. Three years later, the museum opened and became a popular attraction. Its exhibitions were set in a single large dome on three ring-shaped floors with two balconies. Some of the displays were interactive. The upper ring described problems associated with the rapid growth of world population and emphasized the importance of science and technology. The second ring was devoted to practical applications of scientific knowledge and the lowest ring to developments in industry. By the early 1980s, however, the number of visitors had declined, and in 1989 the museum closed. The building subsequently served various functions for Philips before becoming a conference and events centre in 1998.
