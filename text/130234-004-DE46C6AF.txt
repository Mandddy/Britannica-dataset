Glossitis,  inflammation of the tongue characterized by loss of the surface papillae, a condition that gives the affected area a smooth, red appearance. Glossitis may be the primary disease, or may be a symptom of one of several hereditary and acquired conditions (such as certain forms of anemia, pellegra, syphilis, or nutritional deficiencies). There may, however, be a mild burning sensation that can be controlled with topical anesthetics.
Geographic tongue (benign migratory glossitis) refers to the chronic presence of irregularly shaped, bright red areas on the tongue, surrounded by a narrow white zone; normal tongue epithelium may grow back in one area while new areas of glossitis develop elsewhere, making the disease seem to wander. Median rhomboid glossitis refers to a single rough, lozenge-shaped area of glossitis in the midline of the tongue; it appears to be a combination of anomalous fetal development and a yeast infection. Atrophic glossitis, in which the area of inflammation covers the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, is associated with chronic disease or malnutrition and may heal spontaneously when the underlying cause is corrected. Though some individuals fear that glossitis is cancerous, malignancy is rarely associated with the condition.
