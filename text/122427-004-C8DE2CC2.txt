Moscow Canal, Russian Kanal Moskva,   ship waterway linking Moscow to the Volga River at Ivankovo, north of Moscow. Built between 1932 and 1937, the canal replaced the canalized Moskva River, which can take only small craft, as the main water access to Moscow. The water journey to the important industrial centre of Nizhny Novgorod (formerly Gorky) was shortened by 75 miles (120 km). Along the Moscow Canalâ€™s length of 80 miles (128 km) there are 11 locks. The minimum depth is 18 feet (5.5 m), and lock dimensions are 950 by 100 feet (290 by 30 m).
