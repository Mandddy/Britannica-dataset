Gardasil, trade name of human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine, recombinant, the first HPV vaccine used primarily to prevent cervical cancer in women. Developed by Australian immunologist Ian Frazer, the vaccine works against four types of HPVâ€”6, 11, 16, and 18.
In 2006 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the vaccine for use in girls and women aged 9 to 26. Two years later the agency extended its approval to cover use for boys and men of the same age range. This extension came following the realization that Gardasil may also benefit gay men, who are at high risk of HPV-associated genital warts and cancers of the penis and anus. In the United Kingdom the vaccine was approved for use in girls and women aged 9 to 26, as well as for use in boys aged 9 to 15.
