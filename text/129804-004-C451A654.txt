Andrew Bird,  (born July 11, 1973, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American pop songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, known for his virtuosic skill on the violin, which he often sampled and looped onstage, and for his meticulously crafted songs that combine wistful melodies with hyperliterate lyrics.
Bird was immersed in music from early childhood. He began taking Suzuki-method violin lessons at age four and later earned a degree (1996) in violin performance from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. He chafed at the rigid expectations of the classical music world, however, and after graduation supported himself by playing his instrument everywhere from weddings to Renaissance fairs. Having developed an interest in vintage jazz, he soon fell in with the popular swing-revival band the Squirrel Nut Zippers, appearing on three of their albums in the late 1990s. In the meantime, he landed a recording contract of his own.
