Martin, any of several swallows belonging to the family Hirundinidae (order Passeriformes). In America the name refers to the purple martin (Progne subis) and its four tropical relativesâ€”at 20 cm (8 inches) long, the largest American swallows. The sand martin, or bank swallow (Riparia riparia), a 12-centimetre (5-inch) brown and white bird, breeds throughout the Northern Hemisphere; it makes nest burrows in sandbanks. The house martin (Delichon urbica), blue-black above and white-rumped, is common in Europe. The African river martin (Pseudochelidon eurystomina) of the Congo River is black, with red eyes and bill; it is sometimes placed in a separate family, Pseudochelidonidae. The so-called bee-martin, or bee bird, is not a martin but a kingbird.
