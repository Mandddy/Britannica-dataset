Pillow Talk, American romantic comedy film, released in 1959, that features the first on-screen pairing of actors Rock Hudson and Doris Day.
Day earned her sole Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Jan Morrow, a successful, self-reliant urban career woman whose quiet, secure life is turned upside down when she has to share a “party line” (shared phone line) with the talented composer and playboy Brad Allen (played by Rock Hudson). Problems arise when Allen ties up the line with calls to his many girlfriends—calls that Morrow is, of course, party to. Eventually Allen devises a way to seduce Morrow by posing as a naïve gentleman from Texas. She soon discovers the ruse, and Hudson’s character is forced to win her affections once again, this time as himself.
