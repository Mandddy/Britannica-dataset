Kestrel, any of several small birds of prey of the genus Falco (family Falconidae) known for their habit of hovering while hunting. Kestrels prey on large insects, birds, and small mammals. They exhibit sexual colour dimorphism, rare among hawks: the male is the more colourful. Kestrels are mainly Old World birds, but one species, the American kestrel (F. sparverius), called sparrow hawk in the United States, is common throughout the Americas. The American kestrel is about 30 cm (12 inches) long, white or yellowish below and reddish brown and slate gray above, with colourful markings on the head.
The common kestrel (F. tinnunculus), ranging over most of the Old World and sometimes called the Old World, Eurasian, or European kestrel, is slightly larger than the American kestrel but less colourful. It is the only kestrel in Britain, where it is called “windhover” from its habit of hovering while heading into the wind, watching the ground for prey. The Australian kestrel, F. cenchroides, is also called a sparrow hawk.
