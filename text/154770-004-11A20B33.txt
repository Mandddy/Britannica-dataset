Cesaria Evora,  (born August 27, 1941, Mindelo, Cape Verde—died December 17, 2011, Mindelo) Cape Verdean singer and Grammy Award-winning recording artist known for her rich, haunting voice.
Evora was born and raised on the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde, off the west coast of Africa. Her father, a musician, died when she was seven, and she was raised by her mother and grandmother. Evora began singing as a child, and by the time she was a young adult, she routinely performed in the bars of her hometown of Mindelo. She sang in Creole-Portuguese, usually accompanied by guitar, piano, or the cavaquinho, a four-stringed instrument similar to a ukulele. She became known for singing mornas, traditional Cape Verdean folk songs that were sorrowful, emotion-charged chronicles of the country’s long and bitter history of isolation, slave trade, and population loss due to emigration. She also sang coladeras—mornas with a faster tempo. Although her music earned her a multitude of fans on the islands of Cape Verde, it did not provide financial success.
