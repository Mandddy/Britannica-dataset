Kingdom of the Bosporus, also called Cimmerian Bosporus,  ancient Greek state situated on Kerch Strait in present-day southern Ukraine. It reached its peak of power in the 4th century bc.
The kingdom’s major city, Panticapaeum (modern Kerch), was ruled by the Archaeanactid dynasty (480–438 bc), then by the Spartocid dynasty (438–110 bc), which annexed to Panticapaeum other Greek colonies—e.g., Nymphaeum, which had been founded in the region in the 7th and 6th centuries. After the second half of the 5th century, Athenian influence was strong among the Bosporus cities; Athens controlled local trade until 404 bc and remained the chief customer of the Bosporus’ food and other exports throughout the 4th century. The Spartocids suppressed piracy in the Black Sea, and through their management of the trade in grain, fish, and slaves, the Bosporus state prospered. The kingdom’s dynastic and financial decline began in the middle of the 3rd century, and after 110 bc the kings of Pontus controlled the region. A new dynasty, established in the 1st century ad, ruled for 300 years under the protection of the Roman Empire. After ad 342 the country was alternately under barbarian and Byzantine control.
