Willis Tower, formerly (1973–2009) Sears Tower,  skyscraper office building in Chicago, Illinois, located at 233 South Wacker Drive, that is one of the world’s tallest buildings. The Sears Tower opened to tenants in 1973, though construction was not actually completed until 1974. Built for Sears, Roebuck and Company, the structure reaches 110 floors and a height of 1,450 feet (442 metres), excluding broadcast antennas and their supports. (See Researcher’s Note: Height of the Willis [Sears] Tower.) The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) was responsible for the design and construction of the tower; Bruce Graham served as architect and Fazlur Khan as structural engineer.
In 1969 Sears, Roebuck and Company was the world’s largest retailer, employing approximately 350,000 people. In order to consolidate current staff and accommodate anticipated growth, the company hired SOM to design a three-million-square-foot office tower. The location of the tower was strategically selected for its proximity to expressways and commuter rail lines to benefit Sears employees. But in the end, the tower’s location proved to be advantageous for the city as well. The inhabitants of the bustling office building generated new energy in a formerly stagnant West Loop neighbourhood.
