Battle of Palo Alto, (May 8, 1846), first clash in the Mexican War, fought at a small site in southeastern Texas about 9 miles (14.5 km) northeast of Matamoros, Mex. Mexican troops had crossed the Rio Grande to besiege Fort Brown and to threaten General Zachary Taylorâ€™s supply centre. General Taylor and his army met the invaders at Palo Alto with superior artillery. Despite the greater numbers and crack cavalry units of the Mexican army, commanded by General Mariano Arista, the Mexicans suffered heavier casualties. Disheartened by their lack of success, they retired the next day to a defensive position farther south.
