Triton shell, any of several marine snails constituting the family Cymatiidae (subclass Prosobranchia of the class Gastropoda), in which the shell usually is spired, the body whorl is large, and the aperture in the first whorl of the shell is broadly or narrowly toothed. The triton’s shell may be ridged or knobbed.
Tritons are warm-water predators. Species of the genus Triton are among the largest of the family. Those of the genus Charonia, of the Caribbean and the Indo-Pacific region, are called triton trumpets; C. tritonis is actually used as a trumpet in Shintō temples in Japan. For dwarf tritons, see murex.
