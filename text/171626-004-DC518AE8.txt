Sir George Prevost, 1st Baronet,  (born May 19, 1767, New Jersey [U.S.]—died January 5, 1816, London, England) soldier in the service of Great Britain, who was governor in chief (1811–15) of Upper and Lower Canada (now Ontario and Quebec). He was known for his conciliatory policies toward French Canadians.
Prevost attained the rank of major in the British army by 1790. From 1794 to 1796 he saw active service in the West Indies. In 1798, as a brigadier general, he was made lieutenant governor of St. Lucia. He dealt successfully with the French there, adopting a policy of conciliation toward them, no doubt facilitated by his fluency in French. He was created a baronet in 1805 for his services in the West Indies.
