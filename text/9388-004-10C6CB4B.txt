Shōzoku,  vestments worn by the Shintō priests of Japan during the performance of religious ceremonies. Most of the costumes appear to date from the Heian period (794–1185) and originated as dress of the noblemen, the colours and cut often determined by court rank.
The basic garment is the hakama, a wide split skirt that falls to the ankles and is coloured white, light blue, or (for high dignitaries) purple. Over this are worn two or more layers of kimono-type garments, the most formal of which is the white silk saifuku. Over the saifuku is worn the hō, coloured black, red, or light blue. Less formal are the jōe, a robe of white silk, and the varicoloured kariginu (which means “hunting garment,” attesting to the use made of it during the Heian period); laymen, too, may wear these garments during visits to shrines or participation in religious ceremonies.
