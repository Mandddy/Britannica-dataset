Originally in the territory of the Xi (Western) Qiang peoples, Lanzhou became part of the territory of Qin in the 6th century bce. Under the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce), it became the seat of Jincheng xian (county) in 81 bce and later of Jincheng jun (commandery); the county was renamed Yunwu. In the 4th century it was briefly the capital of the independent state of Qian (Former) Liang. The Bei (Northern) Wei dynasty (386–534/535) reestablished Jincheng commandery and renamed the county Zicheng.
