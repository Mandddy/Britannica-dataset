Samuel Eto’o, in full Samuel Eto’o Fils  (born March 10, 1981, Nkon, Cameroon) Cameroonian professional football (soccer) player who is considered one of the greatest African footballers of all time.
Eto’o attended the Kadji Sports Academy in Douala, Cameroon, and first came to national prominence while playing for UCB Douala, a second-division club, in the 1996 Cup of Cameroon. At only 16 years of age, he caught the attention of Real Madrid—one of the top teams in Europe—who signed him in 1997, though Eto’o saw little playing time. Nor did he see much action after joining Cameroon when it qualified for the 1998 World Cup but faltered in the first round.
