Lan Caihe, Wade-Giles romanization Lan Ts’ai-ho,  in Chinese religion, one of the Baxian, the Eight Immortals of Daoism, whose true identity is much disputed. Artists depict Lan as a young man—or woman—carrying a flute or a pair of clappers and occasionally wearing only one shoe. Sometimes a basket of fruit is added. In Chinese theatre Lan is dressed in female clothes but speaks with a male voice. Lan traveled the streets singing ballads, some of which are still preserved, before being carried off to heaven in an intoxicated state by a stork, one of several Chinese symbols for immortality.
