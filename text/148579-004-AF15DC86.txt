Ahmed I,  (born April 18, 1590, Manisa, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died November 22, 1617) Ottoman sultan from 1603 to 1617, whose authority was weakened by wars, rebellions, and misrule. The rebellions he was able to suppress; he executed some of the viziers and exiled many palace dignitaries for bribery and intrigue, and he introduced a new regulation for the improvement of land administration. The peace of Zsitvatörök (1606) that he signed with Austria was a blow to Ottoman prestige, and he was compelled to extend commercial privileges to France, Venice, and the Netherlands within his domains.
Ahmed was pious and made many donations, especially to the holy places of Mecca and Medina. He built the great Blue Mosque near the Hagia Sophia. Of his seven sons, Osman II, Murad IV, and İbrahim I eventually succeeded to the throne.
