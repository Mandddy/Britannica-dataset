Edward Bellamy,  (born March 26, 1850, Chicopee Falls, Mass., U.S.—died May 22, 1898, Chicopee Falls) American writer known chiefly for his utopian novel Looking Backward, 2000–1887.
The son of a Baptist minister, Bellamy first realized the plight of the urban poor at 18 while studying for a year in Germany. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1871, but soon turned to journalism, first as an associate editor for the Springfield (Massachusetts) Union and then as an editorial writer for the New York Evening Post. Bellamy’s early essays and stories sometimes indirectly criticized conventional American attitudes.
