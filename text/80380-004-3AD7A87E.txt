Larry Doby, byname of Lawrence Eugene Doby  (born Dec. 13, 1923, Camden, S.C., U.S.—died June 18, 2003, Montclair, N.J.) American baseball player, the second African American player in the major leagues and the first in the American League when he joined the Cleveland Indians in 1947.
The son of a semipro baseball player, Doby excelled at baseball, basketball, and football, earning an athletic scholarship to Long Island University in New York. Doby played for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League in 1942 and 1943 before enlisting in the U.S. Navy. He returned to the Newark Eagles for the 1946 and 1947 seasons until Bill Veeck signed him to play with the Cleveland Indians at the end of the 1947 season. Doby, whose own father had died when he was 8 years old, spoke of Veeck as a second father. When some of his new teammates refused to shake his hand, Veeck got rid of them before the next season began. Like Jackie Robinson, Doby was excluded from many segregated hotels and restaurants frequented by teammates, received numerous death threats, and had to overcome the animosity of other players and fans; however, since the papers were already reporting Robinson’s troubles, Doby’s struggles were mostly ignored at the time.
