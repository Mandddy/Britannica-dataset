Hugues de Lionne,  (born Oct. 11, 1611, Grenoble, France—died  Sept. 1, 1671, Paris) French secretary of state for foreign affairs from 1663 to 1671 who laid the diplomatic groundwork that enabled King Louis XIV to initiate wars of conquest against the Spanish (War of Devolution, 1667–68) and the Dutch (1672–78).
Born into the lower nobility, Lionne was the nephew of the French diplomat Abel Servien. He received training in international politics at an early age, and he was made an adviser for foreign affairs when Cardinal Jules Mazarin became chief minister on the accession of the four-year-old Louis XIV in 1643. While Mazarin was in temporary exile during the aristocratic uprising known as the Fronde (1648–53), Lionne remained in Paris as his agent. In 1659 Lionne negotiated the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which ended a 24-year war with Spain by arranging a marriage between Louis XIV and Marie-Thérèse, daughter of the Spanish king Philip IV. Lionne was responsible for the treaty’s moyennant (“on condition”) clause by which Marie-Thérèse renounced her claims to the Spanish throne in return for a large dowry.
