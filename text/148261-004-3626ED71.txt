Derbyshire, administrative, geographic, and historic county in the East Midlands of England. The landscape varies from the bleak moorlands of the northern Peak District to the Trent lowlands in the south, and industry ranges from tourism in the Peak District to mining and engineering in the eastern and southern coalfields.
The administrative, geographic, and historic counties cover slightly different areas. The administrative county comprises eight districts: Amber Valley, Bolsover, Derbyshire Dales, North East Derbyshire, South Derbyshire, and the boroughs of Chesterfield, Erewash, and High Peak. Matlock is the administrative centre of the county. The geographic county includes the entire administrative county, as well as the city of Derby, which forms an independent unitary authority. The district of High Peak includes the north Langdendale area, extending east from Tintwhistle, which belongs to the historic county of Cheshire. Apart from this area, the historic county of Derbyshire includes the entire geographic county, together with the area around Beighton and Mosborough, administratively part of the metropolitan borough of Sheffield, and the areas around Rocester east of the River Dove and Burton-upon-Trent east of the River Trent, both in the East Staffordshire district of the administrative county of Staffordshire.
