Lyretail,  any of a half dozen species of fishes in the genus Aphyosemion of the family Cyprinodontidae (order Atheriniformes). All are freshwater species of tropical Africa. They attain lengths of five centimetres (two inches). Female lyretails are drab olive or beige, but the males are brilliantly speckled and spotted with reds, yellows, greens, and blues. The tail is fan-shaped with extended filaments at the top and bottom giving the appearance of a lyre. The Cape Lopez lyretail (A. australe), one of the first species to be imported, is a popular aquarium fish, as are the others. Lyretails belong to the killifish group.
