Nitride, any of a class of chemical compounds in which nitrogen is combined with an element of similar or lower electronegativity, such as boron, silicon, and most metals. Nitrides contain the nitride ion (N3−), and, similar to carbides, nitrides can be classified into three general categories: ionic, interstitial, and covalent.
Certain metal nitrides are unstable, and most react with water to form ammonia and the oxide or hydroxide of the metal; but the nitrides of boron, vanadium, silicon, titanium, and tantalum are very refractory, resistant to chemical attack, and hard—and thus are useful as abrasives and in making crucibles.
