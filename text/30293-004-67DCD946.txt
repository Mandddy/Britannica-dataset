Sir Marc Isambard Brunel,  (born April 25, 1769, Hacqueville, France—died  Dec. 12, 1849, London, Eng.) French-émigré engineer and inventor who solved the historic problem of underwater tunneling.
In 1793, after six years in the French navy, Brunel returned to France, which was then in the midst of revolution. Within a few months his royalist sympathies compelled him to leave. He fled to the United States, where he held the post of chief engineer of New York City. He built many buildings, improved the defenses of the channel between Staten Island and Long Island, and constructed an arsenal and a cannon foundry. A design of his won the competition for the new Capitol to be built in Washington, D.C., but another design was used because of economic considerations.
