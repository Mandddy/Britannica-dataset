Tarahumara, self-name Rarámuri,  Middle American Indians of Barranca de Cobre (“Copper Canyon”), southwestern Chihuahua state, in northern Mexico. Their language, which belongs to the Sonoran division of the Uto-Aztecan family, is most closely related to those of the Yaqui and Mayo. Culturally the Tarahumara show similarities to such neighbouring Uto-Aztecan peoples as the Tepehuan, Huichol and Cora, and Pima-Papago. They numbered about 70,000 at the turn of the 21st century. The land inhabited by the Tarahumara is high, broken plateau, cut by deep gorges and canyons; the climate is reasonably cool, but conditions are not particularly suited for agriculture. The Tarahumara—who were forced from more-hospitable lands by Spanish settlers—are nonetheless small-scale farmers, growing corn (maize), beans, squash, and potatoes and tending orchards. They also keep goats and cattle. Crops are grown in small pockets of suitable soil, and a household’s crops may be separated from one another by several miles. Settlements are scattered, usually loose clusters of households called ranchos. Each home consists of a one-room log or stone house and several storage huts. Settlements are not particularly stable, and a certain amount of seasonal mobility is usual. Pottery, blanket weaving, and basketry are the chief crafts practiced. The Tarahumara are legendary for their ability to run great distances without tiring, though their name for themselves seems to mean “those who walk well.”
Nominally Roman Catholic, the Tarahumara celebrate fiestas for local patron saints; in the ranchos, however, pre-Christian rituals are usual, and native fiestas are held. Their mythology blends pagan and Christian elements.
