Galilee, Hebrew Ha-galil,  northernmost region of ancient Palestine, corresponding to modern northern Israel. Its biblical boundaries are indistinct; conflicting readings leave clear only that it was part of the territory of the northern tribe of Naphtali.
The frontiers of this hilly area were set down by the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus (1st century ad). They were: ʿAkko (Acre) and Mount Carmel on the west; Samaria and Bet Sheʾan (Scythopolis) on the south; Transjordan on the east; and a line running through ancient Baca (probably modern Bezet) on the north, that line generally corresponding to the modern Israeli-Lebanese boundary. Some geographers extend Galilee’s border northward to the Nahr al-Līṭānī (Leontes River).
