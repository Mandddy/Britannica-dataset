Philip III, byname Philip the Bold, French Philippe le Hardi  (born April 3, 1245, Poissy, Fr.—died  Oct. 5, 1285, Perpignan) king of France (1270–85), in whose reign the power of the monarchy was enlarged and the royal domain extended, though his foreign policy and military ventures were largely unsuccessful.
Philip, the second son of Louis IX of France (Saint Louis), became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother Louis (1260). Accompanying his father’s crusade against Tunis in 1270, he was in Africa when Louis IX died. He was anointed king at Reims in 1271.
