Paddlefish, also called duckbill cat,  either of two species of archaic freshwater fish with a paddle-like snout, wide mouth, smooth skin, and cartilaginous skeleton. A relative of the sturgeon, the paddlefish is of the family Polyodontidae and the order Acipenseriformes. It feeds with mouth gaping open, gill rakers straining plankton from the water.
The American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), also called spoonbill, is greenish or gray and averages about 18 kilograms (40 pounds). It lives in open waters of the Mississippi Basin. The other known species (Psephurus gladius), a larger fish with more slender snout, inhabits the Yangtse River Basin. The flesh of both species is somewhat like catfish; the roe can be made into caviar.
