Hillsborough, county, southern New Hampshire, U.S., bordered to the south by Massachusetts. It is a hilly upland region drained by the Merrimack, Piscataquog, and other rivers and dotted with numerous small lakes, including Franklin Pierce Lake and Powder Mill Pond. Public lands include Clough, Greenfield, Miller, and Silver Lake state parks, as well as Fox, Vincent, and Casalis state forests. Timberland is largely white pine, with stands of maple, birch, beech, spruce, and fir. The county contains several covered truss bridges from the 19th century.
Abenaki Indians of the Penacook Confederacy inhabited the region before European colonists in 1769 established Hillsborough, one of New Hampshireâ€™s original counties. It was named for Wills Hill, earl of Hillsborough. Early industries included soapstone quarrying in Francestown, from 1794, and cotton milling in New Ipswich, from 1803. Notable natives of the county included U.S. President Franklin Pierce, born in Hillsborough in 1804, and newspaper editor Horace Greeley, born in Amherst in 1811.
