Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), a U.S. satellite launched in 2001 that mapped irregularities in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
The CMB was discovered in 1964 when German American physicist Arno Penzias and American astronomer Robert Wilson determined that noise in a microwave receiver was in fact residual thermal radiation from the big bang. The thermal radiation started as light and has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe to longer wavelengths where its radiation is that of a blackbody at a temperature of 2.728 K ( −270.422 °C, or −454.76 °F). WMAP uses microwave radio receivers pointed in opposite directions to map the unevenness—anisotropy—of the background. WMAP is named in tribute to American physicist David Todd Wilkinson, who died in 2002 and who was a contributor to both WMAP and WMAP’s predecessor, the Cosmic Background Explorer.
