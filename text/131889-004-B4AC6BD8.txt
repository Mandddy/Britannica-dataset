Op art, also called optical art,  branch of mid-20th-century geometric abstract art that deals with optical illusion. Achieved through the systematic and precise manipulation of shapes and colours, the effects of Op art can be based either on perspective illusion or on chromatic tension; in painting, the dominant medium of Op art, the surface tension is usually maximized to the point at which an actual pulsation or flickering is perceived by the human eye. In its concern with utterly abstract formal relationships, Op art is indirectly related to such other 20th-century styles as Orphism, Constructivism, Suprematism, and Futurism—particularly the latter because of its emphasis on pictorial movement and dynamism. The painters of this movement differed from earlier artists working in geometric styles, however, in their purposeful manipulation of formal relationships in order to evoke perceptual illusions, ambiguities, and contradictions in the vision of the viewer.
The principal artists of the Op art movement as it emerged in the late 1950s and ’60s were Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Larry Poons, and Jeffrey Steele. The movement first attracted international attention with the Op exhibition “The Responsive Eye” at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1965. Op art painters devised complex and paradoxical optical spaces through the illusory manipulation of such simple repetitive forms as parallel lines, checkerboard patterns, and concentric circles or by creating chromatic tension from the juxtaposition of complementary (chromatically opposite) colours of equal intensity. These spaces create the illusion of movement, preventing the viewer’s eye from resting long enough on any one part of the surface to be able to interpret it literally. “Op art works exist,” according to one writer, “less as objects than as generators of perceptual responses.”
