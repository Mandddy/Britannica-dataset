Men Shen, (
        Chinese: “Door Gods” or “Door Spirits”) Wade-Giles romanization Men-shen, also spelled Menshen,  in Chinese religion, the two door gods whose separate martial images are posted on respective halves of the double front door of private homes to guarantee protection from evil spirits (guei). One tradition reports that two Tang-dynasty generals stood guard at the imperial gates during a serious illness of Tai Zong (reigned 626–649), who was grievously troubled by evil spirits. Their presence was so effective that the emperor ordered their pictures to be posted permanently on the gates—with salutary effects. At a later date another Men Shen was added and given custody of the rear door. The custom of having Men Shen standing guard at one’s door quickly spread throughout China. During the New Year celebration, the images are refurbished in brilliant colours.
