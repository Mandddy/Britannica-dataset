Tuco-tuco (genus Ctenomys), South American burrowing rodents similar to the North American pocket gopher in both appearance and ecology. There are 48 species, although different authorities recognize from 39 to 56. More continue to be found, reflecting the variability in size, colour, and number of chromosomes among different populations. Their name is derived from the sound they make.
Tuco-tucos have small eyes, tiny ears, and short muscular legs with strong claws on the digits. Their stout, cylindrical bodies measure up to 25 cm (10 inches) long, with a tail of up to 11 cm. The dense fur is short in some species and long in others, and it ranges in colour from solid gray through various shades of brown to almost black; underparts are lighter.
