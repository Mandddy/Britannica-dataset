Szekely was raised in Mexico City until age seven, when his family moved to Massachusetts. In elementary school he began styling his name “Louis C.K.,” using a phonetic rendering of his surname. After graduating from high school, he worked as an auto mechanic while trying out stand-up comedy routines at Boston-area open-mike nights. In 1989 C.K. moved to New York City, where he continued to hone his stand-up and began making short films.
