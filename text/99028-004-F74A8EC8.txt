Philippe Starck,  (born January 18, 1949, Paris, France) French designer known for his wide range of designs, including everything from interior design to household objects to boats to watches. He has also worked as an architect.
Most likely influenced by his father, who worked as an aircraft engineer, Starck studied at the Ã‰cole Nissim de Camondo, Paris, and in 1968 set up his first company, which produced inflatable objects. Always interested in design as a total concept, in the 1970s he made a reputation for himself by creating interiors for clients such as the Paris nightclubs La Main Bleue (1976) and Les Bains-Douches (1978).
