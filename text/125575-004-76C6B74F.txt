Paestum, Greek Poseidonia,  ancient city in southern Italy near the west coast, 22 miles (35 km) southeast of modern Salerno and 5 miles (8 km) south of the Sele (ancient Silarus) River. Paestum is noted for its splendidly preserved Greek temples.
Poseidonia was probably founded about 600 bc by Greek colonists from Sybaris, along the Gulf of Taranto, and it had become a flourishing town by 540, judging from its temples. After many years’ resistance the city came under the domination of the Lucanians (an indigenous Italic people) sometime before 400 bc, after which its name was changed to Paestum. Alexander, the king of Epirus, defeated the Lucanians at Paestum about 332 bc, but the city remained Lucanian until 273, when it came under Roman rule and a Latin colony was founded there. The city supported Rome during the Second Punic War. The locality was still prosperous during the early years of the Roman Empire, but the gradual silting up of the mouth of the Silarus River eventually created a malarial swamp, and Paestum was finally deserted after being sacked by Muslim raiders in ad 871. The abandoned site’s remains were rediscovered in the 18th century.
