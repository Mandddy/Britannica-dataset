Alexandru Averescu,  (born April 22, 1859, Izmail, Moldavia [now in Ukraine]—died Oct. 3, 1938, Bucharest, Rom.) military leader and politician who three times served as premier of Romania and was the country’s national hero in World War I.
After serving in the Romanian war of independence against Turkey (Russo-Turkish War, 1877–78), Averescu was sent to Italy for military training. As an army general and newly appointed minister of war during the peasant uprising of March–April 1907, he ruthlessly suppressed the uprising at the cost of several thousand peasant lives. As Romanian chief of staff, he directed military operations against Bulgaria in the Second Balkan War (1913); and during World War I he conducted the successful resistance to the Germans at Mărăști (1917).
