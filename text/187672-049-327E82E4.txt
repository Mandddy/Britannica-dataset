Luciano Benetton,  (born May 13, 1935, Trevisio, Italy) Italian manufacturer and cofounder of the family-run apparel empire Benetton Group, where he was best known for his unconventional advertising campaigns.
Benetton left school at age 14 to work in a clothing store after the death of his father, a businessman. In 1965 he, his brothers, Carlo and Gilberto, and his sister, Giuliana, formed the Benetton Group. Reputedly, the sale of Luciano’s bicycle had raised the money needed to buy the company’s first knitting machine. More important, the implementation of a wool-softening process that he had encountered in Scotland helped establish a pattern of productivity and innovation that became the company’s trademark. Under a “system of services,” Benetton contracted out most manufacturing to smaller textile producers and specialized in design, dyeing, and cutting. It also established an unusual franchise arrangement whereby independent retailers stocked only Benetton clothing. Franchises proliferated wildly owing to Benetton’s popular bright-coloured knitwear, and, helped by favourable exchange rates, the firm prospered during the 1980s and early ’90s.
