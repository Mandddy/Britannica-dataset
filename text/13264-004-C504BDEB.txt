Irving Bacheller, in full Irving Addison Bacheller  (born September 26, 1859, Pierpont, New York, U.S.—died February 24, 1950, White Plains, New York) journalist and novelist whose books, generally set in upper New York state, are humorous and full of penetrating character delineations, especially of rural types.
Bacheller graduated from St. Lawrence University, Canton, New York, in 1882 and entered journalism. In 1883 in Brooklyn, New York, he founded the first modern newspaper syndicate and through its services distributed fiction by such writers as Joseph Conrad, Rudyard Kipling, and Stephen Crane, as well as nonfiction material. From 1898 to 1900 he was editor of the New York World. Bacheller became extremely popular for Eben Holden: A Tale of the North Country (1900), which sold more than 1,000,000 copies. This novel about a hired man gives an authentic picture of 19th-century farm life and character in upper New York state. D’ri and I (1901), a novel about the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, was also popular. His own favourites were The Light in the Clearing (1917) and A Man for the Ages: A Story of the Builders of Democracy (1919), the latter a story of Abraham Lincoln. Opinions of a Cheerful Yankee (1926); Coming up the Road, Memories of a North Country Boyhood (1928); and From Stores of Memory (1938) were autobiographical.
