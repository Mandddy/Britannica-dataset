Zhu Xi, Wade-Giles romanization Chu Hsi, also called Zhuzi or Zhufuzi  (born October 18, 1130, Youxi, Fujian province, China—died April 23, 1200, China) Chinese philosopher whose synthesis of neo-Confucian thought long dominated Chinese intellectual life.
Zhu Xi was the son of a local official. He was educated in the Confucian tradition by his father and passed the highest civil service examination at the age of 18, when the average age for such an accomplishment was 35. Zhu Xi’s first official position (1151–58) was as a registrar in Tongan, Fujian. There he proceeded to reform the management of taxation and police, improve the library and the standards of the local school, and draw up a code of proper formal conduct and ritual, none being previously available. Before proceeding to Tongan, Zhu Xi called on Li Tong, a thinker in the tradition of Song Confucianism who decisively influenced his future thinking. He visited Li again in 1158 and spent several months studying with him in 1160. Li was one of the ablest followers of the 11th-century neo-Confucians who had created a new metaphysical system to compete with Buddhist and Daoist philosophy and regain the Confucian intellectual ascendancy lost for nearly a millennium. Under his influence, Zhu’s allegiance turned definitely to Confucianism at this time.
