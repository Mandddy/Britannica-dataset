Palazzo del Te, English Palace of Te,  summer palace and horse farm near Mantua, Italy, of Duke Federico Gonzaga II. It was designed and built (c. 1525–35) by Giulio Romano, who also executed several of the fresco murals decorating the interior. The palace and its wall paintings are traditionally considered among the most important architectural expressions of Mannerism—especially in juxtaposed and displaced elements that create an effect of whimsy and motion. The building consists of a square block around a central court, with a splendid garden opening off at right angles to the main axis. The principal rooms are the Sala di Psiche, with erotic frescoes of the loves of the gods; the Sala dei Cavalli, with life-size portraits of some of the Gonzaga horses; and the fantastic Sala dei Giganti, a continuous scene, painted from floor to ceiling, of the giants attempting to storm Olympus and being repulsed by the gods. The palace is open to the public.
