Hugo Kołłątaj,  (born April 1, 1750, Doderkały Wielkie, Volhynia, Pol.—died  Feb. 28, 1812, Warsaw) Polish Roman Catholic priest, reformer, and politician who was prominent in the movement for national regeneration in the years following the First Partition of Poland (1772).
After studying in Kraków, Vienna, and Rome, Kołłątaj returned home in 1775 to play a leading part in the new Commission for National Education (1773), especially in reforming the ancient University of Kraków, of which he became rector (1782–86). Given an administrative post, he devoted his abilities to preparing, with a group of intellectual and political followers, a program of reform to guide the Four Years’ Sejm (1788–92) in its task of reconstructing Polish social and political institutions. The ideas that he put forward underlay the constitution of May 3, 1791, whereby the middle class was accorded a role in public affairs. He was then appointed vice-chancellor. Deprived of authority after the defeat of the Poles by the Russians in 1792, he went into exile to Leipzig and Dresden but returned to Poland to join Tadeusz Kościuszko’s insurrection against Russia in 1794. When the uprising failed, Kołłątaj was imprisoned in Austria (1794–1802). On his release he resumed his educational activities, founding the college of Krzemieniec in Volhynia, but he was imprisoned in Moscow in 1807–08. He welcomed the reforms associated with the introduction of the Napoleonic Code and became the patron of the younger men who formed the radical opposition in the Duchy of Warsaw.
