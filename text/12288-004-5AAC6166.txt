Engelbert Dollfuss,  (born October 4, 1892, Texing, Austro-Hungarian Empire—died July 25, 1934, Vienna, Austria) Austrian statesman and, from 1932 to 1934, chancellor of Austria who destroyed the Austrian Republic and established an authoritarian regime based on conservative Roman Catholic and Italian Fascist principles.
After studying law and economics in Vienna and Berlin, Dollfuss became secretary to the Farmers’ Association of Lower Austria province (Niederösterreichischer Bauernbund) and, in 1927, director of the Lower Austrian chamber of agriculture. He was a member of the conservative and clerically oriented Christian Social Party, the core of whose constituency came from Austria’s conservative peasantry. Dollfuss rose rapidly in Austrian politics, serving as president of the federal railways in 1930 and as minister of agriculture from 1931. In May 1932 he became chancellor, heading a conservative coalition led by the Christian Social Party.
