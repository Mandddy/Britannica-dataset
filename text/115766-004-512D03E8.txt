Yarra River,  river, south-central Victoria, Australia. It rises near Mount Matlock in the Eastern Highlands and flows westward for 153 miles (246 km) through the Upper Yarra Dam, past the towns of Warburton, Yarra Junction, and Warrandyte, to Melbourne. The river’s upper course traverses timber and dairy country; its mouth at Hobson’s Bay (at the head of Port Phillip Bay), formerly a swamp, was dredged to create the port of Melbourne. Development of the upper Yarra River basin is controlled by the New Yarra Valley Authority, created in 1977. The river was seen in 1803 by Charles Grimes during his survey of Port Phillip Bay, and its first settlement (1835) grew to become the city of Melbourne. The Yarra was once called Great, or Freshwater, River, and its present Aboriginal name means “running water.”
