Adam Sedgwick,  (born March 22, 1785, Dent, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 27, 1873, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) English geologist who first applied the name Cambrian to the geologic period of time, now dated at 570 to 505 million years ago.
Sedgwick was educated at the grammar schools of Dent and Sedbergh and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where in 1810 he was elected a fellow. Although he was a mathematician and knew little about geology, he was appointed Woodwardian professor of geology at Trinity College in 1818. (At that time, university appointments were often based upon a man’s general merits rather than his special training.) Sedgwick immediately set about establishing the importance of geology in university studies. He also began the numerous geologic expeditions characteristic of his career. In 1827 he joined Roderick I. Murchison in cooperative investigations in western and northern Scotland, the first of many joint efforts throughout Britain and the European continent.
