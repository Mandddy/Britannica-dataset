Fox terrier, breed of dog developed in England to drive foxes from their dens. The two varieties of fox terrier, wirehaired and smooth-haired, are structurally similar but differ in coat texture and in ancestry. The wirehaired, or wire, variety was developed from a rough-coated black-and-tan terrier, the smooth from the beagle, greyhound, bull terrier, and a smooth-coated black-and-tan terrier. At one point the two varieties were crossed, but this practice was discontinued. Both varieties are sturdily built, lively looking dogs with tapered muzzles and folded, V-shaped ears. They stand about 15 inches (38 cm), weigh 16 to 18 pounds (7 to 8 kg), and are predominantly white with black or black-and-tan markings. Fox terriers are noted for having bold, energetic, and spirited natures.
