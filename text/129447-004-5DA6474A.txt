Muḥammad Taqī Bahār,  (born 1885, Mashhad, Iran—died  April 22, 1951, Tehrān) poet who is considered to be one of the greatest poets of early 20th-century Iran.
Bahār succeeded his father, Sabūrī, as court poet of the reigning monarch, Moẓaffar al-Dīn Shāh (reigned 1896–1907). Gradually, however, Bahār broke away from the court and became a sympathizer with the revolution. As editor of a liberal democratic newspaper in Mashhad, and later in Tehrān, called Now bahār (“The New Spring”), he wrote in praise of the new Iranian constitution. He led an active political life as a deputy of the Iranian Parliament and became head of a literary group called Dānishkadeh (“The Place of Knowledge”). The group published a journal by the same name in which Bahār expressed his conservative literary tastes, upholding the classical style against that of the avant-garde poets. He remained engaged with politics throughout his life, including a brief period as minister of national education in 1946. He also devoted himself to teaching and cultural projects. His poetry, although written in essentially classical Persian style, was unique in his expression of modern social ideas and criticism of his country and government, often in biting satire. He also wrote a novel, essays on literary style and grammar, and treatises on the works of great Persian poets and historians. He made translations from Pahlavi, or Middle Persian, and he edited a number of important classical texts.
