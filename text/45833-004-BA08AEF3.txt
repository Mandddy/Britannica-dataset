Lucile Grahn, original name in full Lucina Alexia Grahn  (born June 30, 1819, Copenhagen, Denmark—died April 4, 1907, Munich, Germany) ballerina, ballet mistress, and choreographer who was the first Danish ballerina to attain international renown.
Grahn received her training at the Royal Danish Theatre School in Copenhagen, where her principal teacher was the ballet master August Bournonville. She made her official debut in 1834, and the following year she created the leading role in his Valdemar (1835). Bournonville took her to Paris in 1834 specifically to see Marie Taglioni in La Sylphide, and upon their return to Copenhagen he produced his own version, in which Grahn appeared in 1836. In 1837 she danced as Quitteria in his Don Quixote. Differences then soured their relationship, and she went to Paris, where she made a successful debut at the Paris Opéra in 1838.
