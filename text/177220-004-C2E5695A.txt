Stanley Kubrick,  (born July 26, 1928, Bronx, New York, U.S.—died March 7, 1999, Childwickbury Manor, near St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England) American motion-picture director and writer whose films are characterized by his dramatic visual style, meticulous attention to detail, and a detached, often ironic or pessimistic perspective. An expatriate, Kubrick was nearly as well known for his reclusive lifestyle in the English countryside as for his painstaking approach to researching, writing, photographing, and editing his infrequent but always much-debated films,
Kubrick grew up in the Bronx, the son of a physician whose interest in chess and photography he began to share at an early age. Bright but bored, Kubrick was a poor student; however, he immersed himself in the role of his high school’s photographer. At age 16 he sold an expressive photo (showing a dejected newspaper vendor surrounded by headlines announcing U.S. Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s death) to Look magazine. Kubrick aborted his studies at the City College of New York shortly after he had started them so that he could join the staff of Look at age 17, and he then traveled the county as a photojournalist for more than four years. He also became a habitué of the retrospective film screenings at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and was especially influenced by the work of Orson Welles and Sergey Eisenstein. In 1950 he shot a short documentary about the run-up to a boxing match, which was released by RKO as Day of the Fight (1951). Kubrick left Look, began auditing classes at Columbia University, became a voracious reader, and turned to full-time filmmaking.
