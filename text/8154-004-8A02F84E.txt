Border collie, breed of herding dog, typically an outstanding sheepdog, which has been used along the English-Scottish border for about 300 years. Considered among the most intelligent breeds, border collies also excel at agility competitions. The border collie stands about 20 inches (51 cm) and weighs 31 to 50 pounds (14 to 23 kg). It is usually a long-haired dog, often black and white in colour, but sometimes red and white or tricolour. The physical appearance of this dog is less important than the ability to herd; for years many breeders resisted breed recognition from groups such as the American Kennel Club (AKC) for fear of encouraging the breeding of border collies that conformed physically to type but were unsuited to their work. In 1995 the border collie became eligible to be registered with the AKC in the Regular Classes.
Border collies compete in trials under the auspices of a number of groups, the oldest being the International Sheepdog Society, which held its first international trial in Scotland in 1906. At a trial, a dog is expected to perform tasks such as bringing sheep to a handler and rounding sheep into a pen. The trial lasts for nine minutes, and each fault or error leads to a deduction from the 100 points the dog and handler have at the start of the trial (points can only be subtracted, not added). Handlers use verbal commands with the collies, such as “come bye” (move clockwise around the flock), “come away” (move counterclockwise around the flock), “look back” (shift your attention to another part of the flock), and “that’ll do” (essentially a command for the dog to come, it means the herding is finished). Border collies are known for glaring at sheep in order to intimidate the stock into doing what they want; this trait is known as “eye” and comes perhaps from the collie’s wolf ancestor who stares down a victim and establishes dominance before attacking.
