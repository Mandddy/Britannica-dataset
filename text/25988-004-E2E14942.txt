Théophraste Renaudot,  (born 1586?, Loudun, France—died  Oct. 25, 1653, Paris) physician and social-service administrator who, as the founder of France’s first newspaper, is considered the father of French journalism.
In 1612 Renaudot traveled to Paris, where he became a protégé of Armand (later Cardinal) de Richelieu, who obtained his appointment as physician to King Louis XIII and commissary general of the poor, with the task of organizing a program of public assistance. Not until 1630, however, was he able to open in Paris a bureau d’adresse, combining the services of a labour bureau, intelligence department, and charity organization that directed sick persons to physicians prepared to give them free treatment.
