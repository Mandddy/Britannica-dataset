John Howard Payne,  (born June 9, 1791, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  April 9, 1852, Tunis, Tunisia) American-born playwright and actor, who followed the techniques and themes of the European Romantic blank-verse dramatists.
A precocious actor and writer, Payne wrote his first play, Julia, or, The Wanderer, when he was 15. Its success caused him to be sent to Union College, Schenectady, N.Y., but family finances forced him to leave two years later. At 18 he made his first stage appearance in John Home’s Douglas, but he encountered much opposition from established actors, and in 1813, at the height of the War of 1812, he sailed for England. At first interned as an enemy national, he was later released and triumphed at Drury Lane in Douglas, repeating his success in other European capitals. In Paris Payne met the actor Talma, who introduced him to French drama, from which many of his more than 60 plays were adapted, and to Washington Irving, with whom he was to collaborate on two of his best plays.
