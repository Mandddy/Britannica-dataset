Achim von Arnim, byname of Karl Joachim Friedrich Ludwig von Arnim   (born Jan. 26, 1781, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]—died  Jan. 21, 1831, Wiepersdorf, Brandenburg) folklorist, dramatist, poet, and story writer whose collection of folk poetry was a major contribution to German Romanticism.
While a student at the University of Heidelberg, Arnim published jointly with Clemens Brentano a remarkable collection of folk poetry, Des Knaben Wunderhorn (“The Boy’s Magic Horn”; the title derives from the opening poem, which tells of a youth who brings the empress a magic horn). The first volume (published 1805, dated 1806) was dedicated to Goethe, who reviewed it appreciatively, though others criticized it for lacking philosophical accuracy. The collection was completed in 1808.
