Fernando Henrique Cardoso,  (born June 18, 1931, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) Brazilian sociologist, teacher, and politician who was president of Brazil from 1995 to 2003.
Cardoso became a professor of sociology at the University of São Paulo in 1958, but the military government that took power in 1964 blacklisted him from teaching in the country’s university system. He went into exile, teaching at universities in Santiago, Chile, and Paris and continuing his research into the relationship between developing countries and the West. He returned to Brazil in 1968, founded the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, and established a reputation as one of the foremost members of the left-wing opposition.
