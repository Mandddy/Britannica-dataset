Rhodochrosite, (
        from Greek: “rose-coloured”) mineral, composed of manganese carbonate (MnCO3), that is a source of manganese for the ferromanganese alloys used in steel production. It is commonly found in ore veins formed at moderate temperatures, in high-temperature metamorphic deposits, and in sedimentary deposits. Notable occurrences are at Cavnic in Romania and at Butte, Mont., and Leadville, Colo., in the United States. Magnesium, iron, and calcium are generally partially substituted for manganese, pure rhodochrosite being relatively rare; rhodochrosite forms a partial solid-solution (chemical substitution) series with calcite and with siderite in which calcium and iron, respectively, replace manganese in the crystal structure. For detailed physical properties, see carbonate mineral (table).
