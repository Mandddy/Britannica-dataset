Narra (genus Pterocarpus), also called asana, padauk, mukwa, Burmese rosewood, or Andaman redwood,  genus of timber trees of the pea family (Fabaceae), native to Asia and Africa. Narra wood is primarily used for cabinetwork; it is usually red or rose colour, often variegated with yellow. The wood is hard and heavy, and the pattern of the grain and the colouring are hardly equaled by any other timber. The name refers especially to Pterocarpus indicus, or India padauk, noted for the ability of its wood to take a high polish.
The trees bear alternate compound leaves that are typically hairy on one or both sides and feature five to nine leaflets. The orange or yellow flowers are borne in panicle clusters and produce winged one-seeded legumes. The trunks of several species are surrounded by huge buttresses extending outward and upward for about 5 metres (15 feet).
