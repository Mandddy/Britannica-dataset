Bernal Díaz del Castillo,  (born c. 1495, Medina del Campo, Castile [Spain]—died 1584, Guatemala City, Guatemala) Spanish soldier and author, who took part in the conquest of Mexico.
In 1514 he visited Cuba and five years later accompanied Hernán Cortés to Mexico. In protest against the academic chronicles of sedentary historians, he wrote his Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España (1632; “True History of the Conquest of New Spain”; Eng. trans. The True History of the Conquest of Mexico), insisting that, as actor and eyewitness, he was better situated to record the truth of the expeditions in their topographical and military details. Diaz’s account is written in an unassuming, colloquial style and has both historical and artistic value. It is also a sourcebook of idiomatic 16th-century Spanish.
