Kelp, any of numerous large coastal seaweeds growing in colder seas and belonging to the order Laminariales (about 30 genera) of brown algae. Until early in the 19th century the ash of such seaweeds was an important source of potash and iodine. Giant kelps, of the genus Macrocystis, are rich in minerals and produce algin, a complex carbohydrate (polysaccharide) useful in various industrial processes, including tire manufacture. Algin is added to ice cream before freezing to prevent ice crystallization and is also used as a suspending and emulsifying agent in other food products.
Laminaria, a large brown seaweed (1 to 3 metres [3.3 to 9.8 feet] long) abundant along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, has a stipe that superficially resembles the stem of land plants. Growth extension occurs at the meristematic region between the stipe (which is perennial) and the blade (which is shed annually).
