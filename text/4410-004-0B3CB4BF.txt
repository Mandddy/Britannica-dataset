Squawfish, also called pikeminnow,   any of several edible fishes of the genus Ptychocheilus found in the rivers of western North America. They are the largest members of the carp family (Cyprinidae) in North America. Because of the offensive connotation attributed to the word “squaw,” these animals are also referred to as pikeminnows. Squawfishes are long, large-mouthed, pikelike fishes. Voracious carnivores, they make lively sport fishes. The largest species, the Colorado River squawfish, or white salmon (P. lucius), may grow to about 1.5 metres (5 feet) with a reported weight of about 36 kilograms (79 pounds); because of changes in its habitat, this species has declined significantly and is considered endangered.
