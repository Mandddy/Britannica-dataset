Elizabeth Palmer Peabody,  (born May 16, 1804, Billerica, Massachusetts, U.S.—died January 3, 1894, Jamaica Plain [now part of Boston], Massachusetts) American educator and participant in the Transcendentalist movement, who opened the first English-language kindergarten in the United States.
Peabody was educated by her mother, who for a time operated an innovative girls’ school in the home, and from an early age she exhibited an interest in philosophical and theological questions. In 1820 she opened a school of her own in Lancaster, Massachusetts, and two years later another in Boston. She also studied Greek with the young Ralph Waldo Emerson. She opened a school in 1825 in Brookline, Massachusetts, where she made the acquaintance of William Ellery Channing, with whom she shared a remarkable intellectual intimacy. As her Socratic tutor, Channing introduced Peabody to the Romantic poets and philosophers of the day, and together they examined the emerging liberal theology of Unitarianism. She also served informally as his secretary (1825–34), recording his sermons and seeing them into print. After her school closed in 1832 Peabody supported herself until 1834 mainly through writing, principally her First Steps to the Study of History (1832), and through private tutoring, when she helped Bronson Alcott establish his radical Temple School in Boston. Her Record of a School, based on her journal of Alcott’s methods and daily interactions with the children, was published anonymously in 1835 and did much to establish Alcott as a leading and controversial thinker.
