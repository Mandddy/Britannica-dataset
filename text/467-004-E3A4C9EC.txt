Geoid, model of the figure of Earth—i.e., of the planet’s size and shape—that coincides with mean sea level over the oceans and continues in continental areas as an imaginary sea-level surface defined by spirit level. It serves as a reference surface from which topographic heights and ocean depths are measured. The scientific discipline concerned with the precise figure of Earth and its determination and significance is known as geodesy.
The geoid is everywhere perpendicular to the pull of gravity and approximates the shape of a regular oblate spheroid (i.e., a flattened sphere). It is irregular, however, because of local buried-mass concentrations (departures from lateral homogeneity at depth) and because of differences in elevation between continents and seafloors. Mathematically speaking, the geoid is an equipotential surface; that is, it is characterized by the fact that over its entire extent the potential function is constant. This potential function describes the combined effects of the gravitational attraction of Earth’s mass and the centrifugal repulsion caused by the rotation of Earth about its axis.
