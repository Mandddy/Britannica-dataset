Hal B. Wallis, in full Hal Brent Wallis  (born September 14, 1899, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died October 5, 1986, Rancho Mirage, California) American motion-picture producer, associated with more than 400 feature-length films from the late 1920s to the mid-1970s.
Wallis began work at age 14 as an office boy and later worked as a traveling salesman. In 1922 his family moved to Los Angeles, where he managed a movie theatre before joining the publicity staff of Warner Brothers in 1923. He soon headed publicity there and by 1928 was chief of production, a job temporarily taken over by Darryl F. Zanuck in 1931. Under Zanuck he produced Little Caesar (1930), which spawned a generation of Warner-produced gangster films, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), and Gold Diggers of 1933. In 1933 Wallis succeeded Zanuck as executive producer in charge of production at Warner Brothers, and in the following decade he produced some of the most popular films in the history of Hollywood, including A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Captain Blood (both 1935), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Dark Victory (1939), The Letter and The Sea Hawk (both 1940), The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), and Casablanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy (both 1942). Besides handling the finance and budgeting of motion pictures, Wallis displayed a knack for choosing the director and the actors who could most effectively exploit a given screenplay. He “discovered” the actors Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, and he significantly aided the careers of Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, Paul Muni, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Montgomery Clift, and Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.
