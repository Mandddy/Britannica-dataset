Emmentaler, also spelled Emmenthaler, also called Swiss Cheese,  cow’s-milk cheese of Switzerland made by a process that originated in the Emme River valley (Emmental) in the canton of Bern. The essential process is followed in most other dairying countries, notably Norway, where the Jarlsberg variety is outstanding, and in the United States, where the cheese is generally called “Swiss.”
Emmentaler is made in large wheel shapes, about 36 inches (90 cm) in diameter by 6 inches (15 cm) in thickness. The curd is formed by rennet. After the usual cutting, stirring, and heating to about 126° F (52° C), all the curd from 2,205 pounds (1,000 kg) of milk is lifted from the whey in one mass in a fine-mesh net and pressed into the characteristic wheel. It is shaped in blocks, salted in strong brine, and then wrapped in film to prevent drying. The cheese is held at a temperature of 72° to 80° F (22° to 27° C), so stimulating the production of carbon dioxide, which forms the characteristic glossy holes or “eyes” in six to eight weeks. Complete ripening of the cheese takes about six months. Pure cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Propionibacterium shermanii are used to control the development of acid, eyes, and flavour.
