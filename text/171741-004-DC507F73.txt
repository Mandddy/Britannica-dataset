Gene Stratton Porter, née Geneva Stratton  (born August 17, 1863, Wabash county, Indiana, U.S.—died December 6, 1924, Los Angeles, California) American novelist, remembered for her fiction rooted in the belief that communion with nature holds the key to moral goodness.
Stratton grew up in rural Indiana, where she developed a deep appreciation for nature that was to stay with her throughout her life. In 1886 she married Charles D. Porter; they settled in Geneva, Indiana, and she continued her nature studies from their luxurious home, which she called Limberlost Cabin after a nearby wild swamp area. About 1895 she began contributing a column on nature photography to Recreation magazine. Later she wrote a similar column in Outing. After a few years she attempted a new field, and, with the success of a short story published in Metropolitan magazine in 1901, she decided on a career in fiction.
