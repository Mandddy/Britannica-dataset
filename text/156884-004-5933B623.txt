Lee Iacocca, byname of Lido Anthony Iacocca   (born October 15, 1924, Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American automobile executive who, as president and chairman of the board of the foundering Chrysler Corporation, secured the largest amount of federal financial assistance ever given to a private corporation at that time.
Iacocca was the son of an Italian immigrant. He graduated from Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1945 and received a master’s degree in engineering from Princeton University in 1946. Hired as an engineer by the Ford Motor Company, he quickly proved that he was better suited for sales. By 1960 he had become general manager of the Ford division and a vice president of the company. Iacocca’s increasing influence at Ford was hastened by his successful promotion of the sporty yet inexpensive Mustang. He was named president of Ford in 1970, but his brash, unorthodox manner led to his dismissal in 1978.
