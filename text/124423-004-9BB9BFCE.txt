Chandi, (
        Sanskrit: “The Fierce”) also called Chandika,  demon-destroying form of the Hindu goddess Shakti, particularly popular in eastern India. She is known by various names, such as Mahamaya (“Great Magic”) or Abhaya (“She Who Is Without Fear”). Her representation is similar to that of Durga, another form of Shakti. She is shown with either 8 or 10 arms, seated on a lion vehicle. Hundreds of folktales and songs tell of her exploits. She is the central figure of an extensive medieval Bengali literature known as Chandi-mangal, the most famous of which is that of Mukundarama Chakravarti (c. 16th century).
