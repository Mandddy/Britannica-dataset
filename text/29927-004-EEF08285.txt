John Beresford,  (born March 14, 1738, Dublin, Ire.—died  Nov. 5, 1805, near Londonderry [now in Northern Ireland]) political leader in the struggle to preserve the political monopoly of the Protestant landowning aristocracy in Ireland. He was once called “king of Ireland” because of his great wealth and control of a vast political patronage.
Beresford served as a member of the privy councils of Ireland (from 1768) and Great Britain (from 1786). As a subordinate commissioner (1770–80) and first commissioner (1780–1802) of Irish revenue, he capably administered and reformed the taxation system, but he gave government jobs to numerous relatives and political allies. He helped to frame Prime Minister William Pitt’s abortive Anglo-Irish Trade Treaty (proposed 1784–85), which was attacked by Henry Grattan and other Irish nationalists who wanted greater commercial independence from Great Britain.
