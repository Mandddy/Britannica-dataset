Ferris State University, public, coeducational institution of higher learning in Big Rapids, Mich., U.S. An “applied polytechnic university,” Ferris State consists of the colleges of allied health sciences, arts and sciences, business, education and human services, optometry, pharmacy, and technology. It offers more than 100 undergraduate programs, several master’s degree programs, and doctoral degrees in optometry and pharmacy. A branch campus in Grand Rapids also offers associate’s and bachelor’s degree programs.
The university was founded in 1884 by educator Woodbridge Ferris, who later served as governor of Michigan and as a U.S. senator. Ferris organized the Big Rapids Industrial School, later renamed the Ferris Institute, in order to train lumberjacks for employment in other trades. The school joined the state higher-education system in 1950; in that year the school suffered a fire that nearly destroyed the campus. It became Ferris State College in 1963 and adopted its present name in 1987.
