Happy Chandler, byname of A.B. Chandler, in full Albert Benjamin Chandler  (born July 14, 1898, Corydon, Ky., U.S.—died  June 15, 1991, Versailles, Ky.) U.S. senator (1939–45), governor of Kentucky (1935–39, 1955–59), and controversial commissioner of American baseball (1945–51).
Chandler attended Transylvania College, Lexington, Ky. (A.B., 1921), and, after a year at the Harvard Law School, attended the University of Kentucky (LL.B., 1924). Turning to politics after a brief stint in private law practice, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate in 1929 and became his state’s lieutenant governor in 1932 and governor in 1935. He modernized the state’s government and then resigned so that he could be appointed to an unexpired seat in the U.S. Senate; he was elected to a full term in 1942.
