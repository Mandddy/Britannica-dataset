Srinivasa Sastri, in full Valangiman Sankarana-rayana Srinivasa Sastri  (born Sept. 22, 1869, Madras [now Chennai], Indiaâ€”died  April 17, 1946, Madras) liberal Indian statesman and founder of the Indian Liberal Federation, who served his country under British colonial rule in many important posts at home and abroad.
Sastri was born of poor Brahman parents in Madras (Chennai). He began his career as a schoolmaster, but his interest in public causes and his powers of oratory soon combined to bring him national fame. In 1907 he joined the political and reform movement of the Servants of India Society, of which he became president in 1915. He was a member of the Madras Legislative Council and was elected to the central legislature in 1916. He welcomed the Government of India Act of 1919, by which, for the first time, control over some aspects of provincial government passed to Indian ministers responsible to the Indian electorate. Elected to the new council of state established under the reforms, he found himself increasingly out of sympathy with the dominant group in the nationalist Indian National Congress party, which declined to cooperate in the reforms and preferred methods of civil disobedience. He therefore left the Congress Party and founded the Indian Liberal Federation, of which he was president, in 1922.
