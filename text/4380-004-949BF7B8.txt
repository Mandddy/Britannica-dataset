All-Star Game, in American professional baseball, a game between teams of outstanding players chosen from National and American league teams who oppose each other as league against league. Arch Ward, a Chicago Tribune sports editor, is credited with promoting the first All-Star Game, which was held in Chicago in 1933 in conjunction with the Century of Progress Exposition. The All-Star Game is held each July; two annual games were played from 1959 to 1962. Most of the gate receipts are donated to the playersâ€™ pension fund. Beginning with the 2003 contest, the winning league in the All-Star Game earned home-field advantage for its representative in the World Series. Similar contests are conducted in American professional football and basketball, as well as on various amateur levels of these and other sports.
