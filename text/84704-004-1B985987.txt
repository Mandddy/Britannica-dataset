Upon graduating from Repton school in England in 1910, Rathbone made his stage debut in Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew in 1911. A number of other Shakespearean roles followed, as well as a part in a London production of The Sin of David (1914). In 1921 Rathbone appeared in the films Innocent and The Fruitful Vine and then traveled to the United States to make his Broadway debut in The Czarina. His next Broadway play, The Swan (1923), was highly successful and established Rathbone as a star of the theatre. Though he maintained a modest career in silent films in between stage work, he was unremarked in Hollywood until his first appearance in a talking picture, The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1929).
