Brett Favre, in full Brett Lorenzo Favre  (born October 10, 1969, Gulfport, Mississippi, U.S.) American professional gridiron football player who broke all the major National Football League (NFL) career passing records as quarterback of the Green Bay Packers.
Favre grew up in Kiln, Mississippi, and attended the University of Southern Mississippi, where he became the football team’s starting quarterback while a freshman. He was drafted by the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons in 1991 but was traded to Green Bay the following year after falling out of favour with Atlanta’s coaching staff. Originally a backup quarterback, he started for an injured teammate in the third game of the 1992 season and never relinquished the position. In 1993 Favre led the Packers to their first play-off appearance in 10 years, and he established himself as one of the premier quarterbacks in the NFL. Known for his agility, competitiveness, and field presence, he was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) a record three consecutive times (1995, 1996, 1997) and led the league in touchdown passes in each MVP year.
