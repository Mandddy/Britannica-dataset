Calcite, the most common form of natural calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a widely distributed mineral known for the beautiful development and great variety of its crystals. It is polymorphous (same chemical formula but different crystal structure) with the minerals aragonite and vaterite and with several forms that apparently exist only under rather extreme experimental conditions.
The carbonate minerals calcite, aragonite, and dolomite have been calculated to make up approximately 15 percent of the Earthâ€™s sediments and sedimentary rocks and about 2 percent of the terrestrial crust. A large percentage of the calcite, the most abundant of these carbonate minerals, occurs in limestones, which constitute noteworthy proportions of many sequences of marine sediments. Calcite is also the chief component of marls, travertines, calcite veins, most speleothems (cave deposits), many marbles and carbonatites, and some ore-bearing veins.
