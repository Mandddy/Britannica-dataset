Pompano,  (Trachinotus), any of several marine fishes of the family Carangidae (order Perciformes). Pompanos, some of which are highly prized as food, are deep-bodied, toothless fishes with small scales, a narrow tail base, and a forked tail. They are usually silvery and are found along shores in warm waters throughout the world. The Florida, or common, pompano (T. carolinus), considered the tastiest, is a valued commercial food fish of the American Atlantic and Gulf coasts and grows to a length of about 45 cm (18 inches) and weight of 1 kg (2 pounds). The blue and silver great pompano (T. goodei), or permit, is found off Florida and the West Indies.
The African pompano, or threadfish, also of the family Carangidae, is Alectis crinitis of the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans. It is about 90 cm long and, especially when young, has very long, threadlike rays extending from the dorsal and anal fins.
