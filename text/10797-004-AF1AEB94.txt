Bernhard Severin Ingemann,  (born May 28, 1789, Torkildstrup, Denmark—died February 24, 1862, Sorø) historical novelist and poet whose works glorifying Denmark’s medieval past were popular for generations. Most of Ingemann’s many works have not won enduring acclaim, but his simple morning and evening songs (1837–38) are much admired in Denmark. The title of his patriotic verse cycle Holger Danske (1837; “Holger [or Ogier] the Dane”) is widely recognized, though the work itself is seldom read.
Ingemann studied at the University of Copenhagen, traveled in Germany and Italy, and later settled at Sorø Academy as a teacher (1822) and director (1843–49). There he produced an epic cycle, Valdemar den Store og hans mœnd (1824; “Waldemar the Great and His Men”), followed by five historical novels, of which the last, Dronning Margrete (1836; “Queen Margrete”), is in verse.
