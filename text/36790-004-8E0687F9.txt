Catulle Mendès,  (born May 22, 1841, Bordeaux, France—died  Feb. 9, 1909, Paris) prolific French poet, playwright, and novelist, most noted for his association with the Parnassians, a group of French poets who advocated a controlled, formal art for art’s sake in reaction to the formlessness of Romanticism.
A banker’s son, Mendès founded La Revue fantaisiste (1861), which became a vehicle for the late works of Théophile Gautier (whose daughter Mendès married in 1866 but left soon afterward) and such poets as Charles Baudelaire and Villiers de L’Isle-Adam. Mendès edited Le Parnasse contemporain (1866, 1871, 1876; “The Contemporary Parnassians”), which named their movement, and he became their historian in La Légende du Parnasse contemporain. He also encouraged members of a younger generation of poets who were to found the Symbolist movement.
