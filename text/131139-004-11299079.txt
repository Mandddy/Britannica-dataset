Niobium processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products.
Niobium (Nb) has a body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structure and a melting point of 2,468° C (4,474° F). Of the refractory metals, it has the lowest density and best workability; for this reason, niobium-based alloys are often used in aerospace applications. Because of its strengthening effect at elevated temperatures, its principal commercial use is as an additive in steels and superalloys. Niobium-titanium and niobium-tin alloys are used as superconducting materials.
