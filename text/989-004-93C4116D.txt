Artúr Görgey,  (born Jan. 30, 1818, Toporcz, Hung., Austrian Empire [now in Slovakia]—died  May 20, 1916, Budapest, Hung., Austria-Hungary) Hungarian army officer famous for his role in the Revolution of 1848–49.
Görgey served as a youth in the Austrian army but left it to study chemistry. Later, when Hungarian patriots raised a national army in 1848, he joined it and soon won a reputation for valour and leadership. After commanding a corps in the attempt to relieve Vienna on Oct. 30, 1848, he was placed in command of the Hungarian forces on the upper Danube River. Austrian armies invaded Hungary in December, but Görgey, recognizing the rawness of his troops, withdrew and refused to defend Budapest. The tension that decision created between him and the nationalist leader Lajos Kossuth was increased when on Jan. 5, 1849, Görgey issued an order to his troops that read like a defiance of the authority of the committee of national defense. Later, however, his brilliant spring offensive nearly drove the Austrians from Hungary.
