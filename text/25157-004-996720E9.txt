Edward Livingston,  (born May 28, 1764, Columbia county, N.Y. [U.S.]â€”died  May 23, 1836, Dutchess county, N.Y.) American lawyer, legislator, and statesman, who codified criminal law and procedure.
Livingston was admitted to the bar in 1785 and began to practice law in New York City. He was a Republican representative in Congress from 1795 to 1801, when he was appointed U.S. district attorney for New York state. In the same year he was elected mayor of New York City. As district attorney, he was held responsible for public funds that had been lost through the dishonesty of one of his clerks. As a consequence, he resigned both his offices in 1803 and moved to Louisiana. He established a large law practice in New Orleans, and he prepared a provisional code of judicial procedure that was in force in Louisiana from 1805 to 1825. In 1821, a year after he became a member of the state legislature, he wrote a code of criminal law and procedure. Although not adopted by the legislature, this code gained wide influence in Europe and the United States.
