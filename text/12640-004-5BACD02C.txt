Georges Courteline, pseudonym of Georges-Victor-Marcel Moineau   (born June 25, 1858, Tours, France—died  June 25, 1929, Paris) French writer and dramatist whose humorous work is a brilliant social anatomy of the late 19th-century middle and lower-middle classes.
Courteline’s father, the humorist Jules Moinaux, tried to dissuade his son from following a literary career. Courteline was obliged to serve in a cavalry regiment and then work in the offices of the Ministry of the Interior (though he seldom attended). He began to publish sketches and short stories. From 1891 he offered farces to the leading Parisian theatres, including André Antoine’s Théâtre-Libre. After 1894 he was able to devote himself entirely to literature.
