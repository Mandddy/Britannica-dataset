Coelophysis (genus Coelophysis), small carnivorous dinosaurs found as fossils from the Late Triassic Period (228 million to 200 million years ago) of North America.
Coelophysis was a primitive theropod dinosaur. Usually growing to length of about 2 metres (6.6 feet), it was very light, weighing only about 18–23 kg (40–50 pounds), and had a long, slender neck, tail, and hind legs. The head was long and narrow, and the jaws were equipped with many sharp teeth.
