Ioannis Metaxas,  (born April 12, 1871, Ithaca, Greece—died January 29, 1941, Athens) general and statesman who was dictator of Greece from 1936 to 1941.
After active service in the Greco-Turkish war of 1897, Metaxas completed his military training in Germany. He distinguished himself on the Greek general staff during the Balkan Wars (1912–13) and was appointed chief of staff in 1913 and promoted to general in 1916. During World War I he unsuccessfully fought to maintain Greek neutrality and opposed the plans of Prime Minister Eleuthérios Venizélos for the conquest of western Anatolia, accurately predicting the military catastrophe that ultimately overtook the Greek offensive in Anatolia in 1921–22. Strongly monarchist in his politics, he was exiled after the deposition of King Constantine I (1917) but returned after the king’s restoration in 1920. With the fall of the monarchy in 1923, Metaxas again temporarily left Greece, but later he held ministerial office under the republic (1928).
