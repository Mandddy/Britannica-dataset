Ogyū Sorai,  (born March 21, 1666, Edo, Japan—died February 28, 1728, Edo) one of the foremost Japanese scholars of Chinese culture and a leading Confucianist. Ogyū stressed the pragmatic application of Confucianism to promote social and political reforms by means of uniform, rational laws. He is also noted for his appreciative commentary on the revered shogunate ruler and administrative reformer Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616).
As a scholar of the Kogaku (“Ancient Learning”) school, Sorai rejected the commentarial tradition that sought to explicate the ancient texts and took the retrieval of the ancient artifact as an act of deserved reverence. He promoted the idea that the Confucian way (dao) is a human construct, the product of wisdom and culture.
