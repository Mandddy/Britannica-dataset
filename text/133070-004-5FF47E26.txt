The Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, N.Y., that is dedicated to the art and architecture of medieval Europe.
The Cloisters is located on 4 acres (1.6 hectares) in Manhattan’s Fort Tryon Park, overlooking the Hudson River. The museum was designed by architect Charles Collens and opened in 1938. It takes its name from elements of five medieval French cloisters that have been incorporated into the building design and serve as connecting points between the various galleries. It houses three medieval chapels, notably the 12th-century Spanish Fuentiduena Chapel. The building’s gothic style, evident in its terraces, galleries, gardens, arcades, and rooms, is meant to evoke the context in which the featured works were created.
