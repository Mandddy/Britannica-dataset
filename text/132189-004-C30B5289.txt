Bahāʾ Allāh, (
        Arabic: “Glory of God”) also spelled Bahāʾullāh, original name Mīrzā Ḥosayn ʿAlī Nūrī   (born November 12, 1817, Tehrān, Iran—died May 29, 1892, Acre, Palestine [now ʿAkko, Israel]) founder of the Bahāʾī Faith upon his claim to be the manifestation of the unknowable God.
Mīrzā Ḥosayn was a member of the Shīʿite branch of Islam. He subsequently allied himself with Mīrzā ʿAlī Moḥammad of Shīrāz, who was known as the Bāb (Arabic: “Gateway”) and was the head of the Bābī, a Muslim sect professing a privileged access to final truth. After the Bāb’s execution by the Iranian government for treason (1850), Mīrzā Ḥosayn joined Mīrzā Yaḥyā (also called Ṣobḥ-e Azal), his own half brother and the Bāb’s spiritual heir, in directing the Bābī movement. Mīrzā Yaḥyā later was discredited, and Mīrzā Ḥosayn was exiled by orthodox Sunnī Muslims successively to Baghdad, Kurdistan, and Constantinople (Istanbul). There, in 1863, he publicly declared himself to be the divinely chosen imām-mahdī (“rightly guided leader”), whom the Bāb had foretold. The resulting factional violence caused the Ottoman government to banish Mīrzā Ḥosayn to Acre.
