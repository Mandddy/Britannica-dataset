Dinis, also spelled Diniz, English Denis  (born Oct. 9, 1261—died Jan. 7, 1325) sixth king of Portugal (1279–1325), who strengthened the kingdom by improving the economy and reducing the power of the nobility and the church.
The son of Afonso III, Dinis was educated at a court subject to both French and Castilian cultural influences and became a competent poet. He founded the first university in Portugal—in Lisbon—in 1290. A skilled negotiator, Dinis was able to establish with Castile a definitive frontier for Portugal. At home, he made the authority of the crown supreme, intervening in local government, reducing the power of the nobility, and combating the supremacy of the clergy, particularly in regard to their territorial wealth (laws of disentail in 1286, 1291, and 1309). Concordats with the papacy (1289 and 1290) ended the struggle with the church.
