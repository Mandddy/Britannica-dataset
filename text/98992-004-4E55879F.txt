Sir Thomas Malory,  (flourished c. 1470) English writer whose identity remains uncertain but whose name is famous as that of the author of Le Morte Darthur, the first prose account in English of the rise and fall of the legendary king Arthur and the fellowship of the Round Table.
Even in the 16th century Malory’s identity was unknown, although there was a tradition that he was a Welshman. In the colophon to Le Morte Darthur the author, calling himself “Syr Thomas Maleore knyght,” says that he finished the work in the ninth year of the reign of Edward IV (i.e., March 4, 1469–March 3, 1470) and adds a prayer for “good delyueraunce” from prison. The only known knight at this time with a name like Maleore was Thomas Malory of Newbold Revell in the parish of Monks Kirby, Warwickshire. This Malory was jailed on various occasions during the period 1450–60, but it is not recorded that he was in prison about 1470, when the colophon was written.
