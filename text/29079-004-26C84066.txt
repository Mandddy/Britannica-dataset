Michelangelo Antonioni,  (born Sept. 29, 1912, Ferrara, Italy—died July 30, 2007, Rome) Italian film director, cinematographer, and producer, noted for his avoidance of “realistic” narrative in favour of character study and a vaguely metaphorical series of incidents. Among his major films are Le amiche (1955; The Girlfriends), L’avventura (1960; The Adventure), L’eclisse (1962; The Eclipse), and Blow-up (1966).
Antonioni is recognizably the product of the mild, uneventful plains of northern Italy that form the background for several of his films. Reserved and unexpansive in manner, he has said that the experience most important to his development as a filmmaker and as a man was his upbringing in a settled, bourgeois, provincial home, with a sufficiency of money; a traditional education; a code of reserve and self-discipline; and the leisure and ease necessary for a detached view of people and of life. He attended school in Ferrara and went to the university at Bologna, though he continued to live at home and commuted daily to his studies. As a child his consuming interests were architecture and painting; at the university he studied classics, then economics and commerce. He also began haunting the cinemas and writing film criticism for a newspaper in the neighbouring city of Padua. In 1939 he decided to make the cinema his career.
