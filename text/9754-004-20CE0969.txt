Jean-Baptiste Oudry,  (born March 17, 1686, Paris, France—died  April 30, 1755, Beauvais) French Rococo painter, tapestry designer, and illustrator, considered one of the greatest animal painters of the 18th century.
Oudry first studied portrait painting with Nicolas de Largillière, a portraitist of Parisian society, through whom he made many connections. His early portraits are often arcadian in setting and tender and sentimentally charming in the Rococo tradition. In his early career he executed many still lifes that were used as decorative inserts for paneled rooms. After he was made a member of the French Royal Academy in 1719, his work consisted largely of animal paintings, tapestry designs, and book illustrations.
