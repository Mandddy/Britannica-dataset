Ozzy Osbourne, byname of John Michael Osbourne  (born December 3, 1948, Birmingham, England) British musician, who gained a loyal following as vocalist for the heavy metal group Black Sabbath before embarking on a successful solo career.
Raised in a working-class family, Osbourne dropped out of school at age 15 and held several low-paying jobs. He also engaged in petty crime and at 17 was imprisoned for two months for burglary. After his release, he sang in a number of local rock groups, eventually forming the rock band Earth with guitarist Tony Iommi. To avoid confusion with another band of the same name, the group changed its name to Black Sabbathâ€”after an old Boris Karloff movie. The group developed a grinding, ominous sound, based on the blues but intensely amplified, and drew attention with its tendency to reference the occult in its lyrics. In February 1970 Black Sabbath released its eponymous first album and quickly developed a following in both Britain and the United States.
