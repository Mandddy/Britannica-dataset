Slave River,  river in northern Alberta and southern Northwest Territories, Canada, forming an integral part of the Mackenzie River waterway. Explored by Samuel Hearne in 1771â€“72, the river was named after the Slave people who inhabited its banks. From the confluence of the Peace River and several small streams draining Lake Athabasca, the Slave flows northward for 258 miles (415 km) through northeastern Alberta and southern Northwest Territories before emptying into Great Slave Lake near Fort Resolution. A portage road joins the two most important settlements, Fort Fitzgerald (Alberta) and Fort Smith (Northwest Territories), bypassing a 16-mile- (26-kilometre-) stretch of rapids. For the first half of its course the river forms the eastern boundary of Wood Buffalo National Park.
