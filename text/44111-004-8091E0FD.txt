Camilo Castelo Branco,  (born March 16, 1825, Lisbon, Portugal—died June 1, 1890, Seide) Portuguese novelist whose 58 novels range from Romantic melodramas to works of realism. He is sometimes known as the Portuguese Balzac.
Born illegitimately into a family believed to have had a hereditary tendency to insanity, Camilo was orphaned in childhood and brought up by relatives in the austere and primitive Trás-os-Montes region of northern Portugal. Allowed to grow up undisciplined and proud, he studied irregularly at Porto, first medicine and later for the priesthood, but eventually abandoned these professions for a literary career.
