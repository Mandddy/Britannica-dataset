Margaret of Parma, Spanish Margarita de Parma  (born 1522, Oudenaarde, Spanish Netherlands—died Jan. 18, 1586, Ortona, Kingdom of Naples) duchess of Parma and Habsburg regent who, as governor-general of the Netherlands (1559–67), attempted to appease the growing discontent with Spanish rule.
The illegitimate daughter of the Holy Roman emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) and Johanna van der Gheenst, Margaret was married in 1536 to Alessandro de’ Medici, Duke of Florence, who was murdered less than a year later. She then married (1538) Ottavio Farnese (Duke of Parma after 1547) and was appointed governor of the Netherlands in 1559 by her half-brother, Philip II of Spain. Opposition to Spanish rule was already strong because of the presence of Spanish troops and especially because of the creation of new bishoprics in 1559 by a papal bull challenging local religious privileges.
