Wrybill, also called Wrybill Plover,   (Anarhynchus frontalis), New Zealand bird of the plover family, Charadriidae (order Charadriiformes), with the bill curved about 20Â° to the right. This unique bill configuration is present even in the newly hatched chicks. The wrybill feeds by probing under stones and by sweeping its bill like a scythe in shallow, muddy water. It is about 15 cm (6 inches) long, gray above and white below with a black breast band. The wrybill nests along rocky rivers in South Island, laying two eggs. Sizable flocks winter along the coasts of North Island.
