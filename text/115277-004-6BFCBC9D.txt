Grain elevator,  storage building for grain, usually a tall frame, metal, or concrete structure with a compartmented interior; also, the device for loading grain into a building. Early elevators were powered by animals; modern facilities use internal-combustion engines or electric motors. One prevalent mechanism consists of a hopper, a long rectangular open trough, and an endless vertical belt or chain with flights (crosspieces) for conveying the grain to the top of the stack. The force of gravity enables elevated grain to be unloaded quickly and easily from chutes. Usually located near railway lines, most grain elevators were until the 1930s owned by railroad companies; ownership today is generally cooperative or private. The grain-storage facility on a farm is usually called the granary, or crib.
