Grand Illusion, French La Grande Illusion,  French war film, released in 1937, that was directed by Jean Renoir. Elegant, humane, and affecting, it has been recognized as a profound statement against war and is often ranked among the greatest films ever made.
During World War I, a French plane piloted by two officers—a wealthy aristocrat, Captain de Boeldieu (played by Pierre Fresnay), and a working-class mechanic, Lieutenant Maréchal (Jean Gabin)—is shot down by a German pilot, Captain von Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim). Upon learning that the surviving Frenchmen are fellow officers, von Rauffenstein, also an aristocrat, invites them to lunch before they are transported to a prisoner-of-war camp. He is especially cordial to de Boeldieu, with whom, he learns, he shares friends. Transcending national boundaries even during wartime, the two enjoy a mutual respect based on social rank; they have more in common with each other than with the lower classes of their own countries.
