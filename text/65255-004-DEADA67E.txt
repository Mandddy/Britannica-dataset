Engagement between Bonhomme Richard and Serapis, (Sept. 23, 1779), in the American Revolution, notable American naval victory, won off the east coast of England by Captain John Paul Jones. Challenged by a large combined French and Spanish fleet, the British Navy was too preoccupied to prevent American interference with its merchant marine in the Atlantic. Operating from French bases, Jones led a small fleet around the British Isles from August to October 1779.
Sighting two enemy ships of war conveying merchantmen loaded with naval stores, Jones’s Bonhomme Richard engaged the British frigate Serapis, commanded by Captain Richard Pearson, in a memorable 3 1/2-hour duel. The American commander answered a challenge to surrender early in the battle with the famous quotation, “I have not yet begun to fight!” The slaughter on both sides was great; an estimated 150 Americans and nearly as many British were killed or wounded. Despite the fact that his ship was sinking (later Jones moved his command to the Serapis), Jones outlasted his adversary and forced a surrender.
