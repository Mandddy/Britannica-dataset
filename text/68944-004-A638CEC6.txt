Léon Foucault, also called Jean Foucault, in full Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault  (born September 18, 1819, Paris, France—died February 11, 1868, Paris) French physicist whose “Foucault pendulum” provided experimental proof that Earth rotates on its axis. He also introduced and helped develop a technique of measuring the absolute speed of light with extreme accuracy.
Foucault was educated for the medical profession, but his interests turned to experimental physics. With Armand Fizeau, he began a series of investigations of light and heat. By 1850 he established that light travels slower in water than in air. In the same year he measured the speed of light, finding a value that is within 1 percent of the true figure.
