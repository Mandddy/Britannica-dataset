Ossip Zadkine,  (born July 14, 1890, Smolensk, Russia—died November 25, 1967, Paris, France) Russian-born French sculptor known for his dramatic Cubist-inspired sculptures of the human figure.
As a boy, Zadkine, the son of a professor of Greek and Latin, preferred clay modeling to his studies. In 1905 his father sent him to stay with relatives in England in order to learn “English and good manners.” He attended art school and eventually worked for a wooden-ornament maker in London. After living alternately in London and Smolensk, in 1909 Zadkine moved to Paris, where he briefly studied at the École des Beaux-Arts; he gave up academic training after a few months to work independently.
