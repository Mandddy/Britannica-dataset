Lytton Strachey, in full Giles Lytton Strachey  (born March 1, 1880, London—died  Jan. 21, 1932, Ham Spray House, near Hungerford, Berkshire, Eng.) English biographer and critic who opened a new era of biographical writing at the close of World War I. Adopting an irreverent attitude to the past and especially to the monumental life-and-letters volumes of Victorian biography, Strachey proposed to write lives with “a brevity which excludes everything that is redundant and nothing that is significant.” He is best known for Eminent Victorians—short sketches of the Victorian idols Cardinal Manning, Florence Nightingale, Thomas Arnold, and Gen. Charles “Chinese” Gordon.
After studying at Cambridge (1899–1903), Strachey lived in London, where he became a leader in the artistic, intellectual, and literary Bloomsbury group. He published critical writings, especially on French literature, but his greatest achievement was in biography. After Eminent Victorians (1918) and Queen Victoria (1921), he wrote Elizabeth and Essex (1928) and Portraits in Miniature (1931). Treating his subjects from a highly idiosyncratic point of view, he was fascinated by personality and motive and delighted in pricking the pretensions of the great and reducing them to somewhat less than life-size. His aim was to paint a portrait; and though this led to caricature and sometimes, through tendentious selection of material, to inaccuracy, he taught biographers a sense of form and of background, and he sharpened their critical acumen.
