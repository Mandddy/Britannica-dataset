Siskin, any of about 20 small brown-streaked birds, marked with yellow, that belong chiefly to the genus Carduelis (including Spinus) of the family Fringillidae. Siskins occur from cold northern regions, worldwide, to the Cape of Good Hope and to Cape Horn. All have conical bills and short forked tails. They flock in fields to feed on weeds, and they make wheezy sounds, often in flight. The 11-cm (4.5-inch) pine siskin (C. pinus) of North America has yellow wing and tail bars. The common siskin (C. spinus) of Europe has a black cap and yellow-tinged breast.
