Bedsore, also called decubitus ulcer or pressure sore,  an ulceration of skin and underlying tissue caused by pressure that limits the blood supply to the affected area. As the name indicates, bedsores are a particular affliction for persons who have been bedridden for a long time. The interference with normal blood flow is caused by the prolonged pressure of the body upon the bed and the friction against the bedclothes. Bedsores are more likely to affect the skin over the bony prominences of the body, such as the elbows, hips, and the back at the level of the hip bones. Prevention and treatment of bedsores include frequent changes of position of the bedridden person, daily bathing, and topical (local) medication.
