The Birds, American thriller film, released in 1963, that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and centres on a small northern California coastal town that is inexplicably attacked and rendered helpless by massive flocks of aggressive birds.
A chance encounter in a San Francisco bird shop between socialite Melanie Daniels (played by Tippi Hedren) and lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) leads Daniels to impulsively follow Brenner to his hometown of Bodega Bay. As they are about to meet, a seagull swoops down and wounds her forehead. This is the first in a series of escalating attacks by birds on the town. The final scene of thousands of birds watching Brennerâ€™s family and Daniels driving away is chilling, though it is unfulfilling to some viewers, as Hitchcock provides no rationale for the strange and violent events that have occurred.
