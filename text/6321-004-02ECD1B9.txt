Sigismund Báthory, Hungarian Zsigmond Báthory   (born 1572—died  1613, Prague, Bohemia, Austrian Habsburg domain [now in Czech Republic]) prince of Transylvania whose unpopular anti-Turkish policy led to civil war.
The son of Christopher Báthory (prince of Transylvania, 1575–81) and nephew of Stephen (István Báthory, king of Poland, 1575–86), Sigismund succeeded his father in 1581 and actually assumed control of government affairs in 1588. Acting on the advice of his foreign counselor Alfonso Carrillo, Báthory reversed the traditional policy of Transylvania (i.e., to play off the Ottoman sultan against the Holy Roman emperor and thereby preserve Transylvanian de facto independence) and adopted an anti-Turk position. Although this policy shift provoked a rebellion, which was not suppressed until 1595, he nevertheless joined the princes Aaron of Moldavia and Michael the Brave of Walachia in an alliance against the Turks in 1594 and conquered Walachia for Michael after defeating an Ottoman army at Giurgiu (in present-day Romania; Oct. 25–27, 1595).
