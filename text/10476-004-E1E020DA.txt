Thomas Killigrew,  (born February 7, 1612, London, England—died March 19, 1683, London) English dramatist and playhouse manager who was better known for his wit than for his plays, although some of the jokes in The Parson’s Wedding (acted c. 1640) were appropriated by the playwright William Congreve.
In 1641 Killigrew published two tragicomedies, The Prisoners and Claracilla, both probably produced before 1636. In 1647 he followed Prince Charles into exile and was favoured with court appointments after the Restoration. In 1660 he received, with Sir William Davenant, a patent for one of two new playhouses, whose performances did not have to be licensed by the master of the revels, Sir Henry Herbert. A dispute with Herbert resulted, but Killigrew made generous concessions acting independently of Davenant. Killigrew’s company became known as the King’s Men.
