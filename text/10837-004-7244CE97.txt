Ibisbill,  (Ibidorhyncha struthersii), Asian bird named for its long, red, down-curved bill (similar to that of an ibis), which it uses to probe for food under stones along streams and ponds. Rather heavyset birds about 40 centimetres (16 inches) long, ibisbills have shorter legs than their familial relatives the avocets and stilts (family Recurvirostridae, order Charadriiformes). The body is gray, with a black breast band and facial mask.
Ibisbills nest at 3,000 metres (9,840 feet) or higher in the Himalayas; they winter in the foothills.
