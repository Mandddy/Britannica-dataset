Helena Bonham Carter,  (born May 26, 1966, London, England) British actress whose dark aesthetic brought flair to roles ranging from period pieces to modern fantasy.
Bonham Carter grew up in London. Her mother, Elena, was a psychotherapist, and her father, Raymond—grandson of H.H. Asquith, who served as prime minister from 1908 to 1916—was a merchant banker who became partially paralyzed after an operation to remove a brain tumour. At age 13 Helena decided to pursue an acting career, and by16 she had landed a role in a television commercial, playing William Shakespeare’s Juliet in an advertisement for a stereo system. The part proved to be an indication of Bonham Carter’s future career, which was built on a foundation of period pieces and adaptations of works by such classic authors as E.M. Forster, Shakespeare, and Henry James.
