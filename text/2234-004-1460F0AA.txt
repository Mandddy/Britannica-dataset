Lysippus,  (flourished c. 370–c. 300 bce, Sicyon, Greece) Greek sculptor, head of the school at Árgos and Sicyon in the time of Philip of Macedon and especially active during the reign of Philip’s son Alexander the Great (336–323 bce). Lysippus was famous for the new and slender proportions of his figures and for their lifelike naturalism.
Originally a worker in metal, he taught himself the art of sculpture by studying nature and the Doryphoros (“Spearbearer”) of Polyclitus, whose canon of ideal male proportions he modified by creating a smaller head and slimmer body that increased his figures’ apparent height.
