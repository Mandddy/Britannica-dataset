Ward Hunt,  (born June 14, 1810, Utica, N.Y., U.S.—died  March 24, 1886, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1873–82).
Admitted to the bar in 1831, Ward quickly developed a successful practice. He was elected to the state legislature as a Jacksonian Democrat in 1838 and served as mayor of Utica in 1844. His opposition to the annexation of Texas and the extension of slavery led to his support of the Free-Soil ticket in 1848. In 1856 he helped organize the Republican Party in New York state.
