Marsupium, specialized pouch for protecting, carrying, and nourishing newborn marsupial young. A marsupium is found in most members of the order Marsupialia (class Mammalia). In some marsupials (e.g., kangaroos) it is a well-developed pocket, while in others (e.g., dasyurids) it is a simple fold of skin; a few species lack any type of marsupium. It contains the teats, to which the incompletely developed young remain attached for a considerable period, during which time they could not survive unprotected.
The term marsupium is sometimes used for functionally similar structures in other animals. The mammary pouch of the echidna (order Monotremata) is a simple fold of skin which develops during the breeding season. In mollusks such as oysters (class Bivalvia), the marsupium is a modified gill structure that holds the eggs and larvae. In the crustacean orders Isopoda and Amphipoda, a marsupium, or brood pouch, is formed by extensions from the thoracic limbs.
