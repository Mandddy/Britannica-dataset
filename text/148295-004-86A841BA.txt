Knee injuries, the common afflictions of the knee, a relatively fragile joint, as it is exposed to stress in daily activities and sports.
Tearing of cartilages or menisci (crescent-shaped disks of cartilage found between the bones) occurs when the knee receives a blow to the side while the leg is fixed in place with the foot on the ground. If the torn cartilage lodges in the joint, severe pain and locking of the knee occur, and surgery is necessary for repair. When the cartilage remains loose, the resulting pain and swelling may be treated by rest and protection alone.
