Peacekeeper missile, also called MX,  intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that was part of the United States’ strategic nuclear arsenal from 1986 to 2005.
The MX (for “missile experimental”) was the most-sophisticated ICBM fielded by the United States during the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Under development from 1971, it evolved into a 22-metre (71-foot) missile with a “bus,” or fourth stage, located in its front end that carried 10 or 12 independently targeted warheads (or MIRVs). This endowed each missile with several times the firepower of the two- or three-warhead Minuteman III, which it was designed to replace. In addition, the missile’s extreme accuracy—made possible by an inertial guidance system updated in flight by signals from navigation satellites—gave its 300-kiloton thermonuclear warheads greater potential to destroy reinforced missile silos and command bunkers in the Soviet Union. The MX had a range of approximately 11,000 km (7,000 miles).
