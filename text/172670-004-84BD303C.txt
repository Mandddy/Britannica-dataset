Teixeira de Pascoaes, pseudonym of Joaquim Pereira Teixeira de Vasconcelos  (born November 1877, São João de Gatão, Portugal—died December 14, 1952, São João de Gatão) Portuguese poet-philosopher who attempted to create a cult of nationalistic mystique based on saudade (“yearning”; an overtone in Portuguese and Brazilian lyric poetry that fuses hope and nostalgia). His work, together with that of António Nobre, was at the core of the Renascença Portuguesa (Portuguese Renaissance) of the early 20th century. Among Pascoaes’s representative books of poetry are Sempre (1898; “Always”), Jesus e Pan (1903; “Jesus and Pan”), and Regresso ao Paraíso (1912; “Return to Paradise”). He was among those who founded the journal of the Renascença Portuguesa, A Águia, in 1910, and he was an editor of it from 1912 to 1916.
