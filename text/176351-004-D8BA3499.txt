Touch of Evil, American film noir, released in 1958, that was written and directed by Orson Welles, who also costarred in the crime drama. The film was a box-office disappointment, but in later years it was recognized as one of the final gems of the classic film noir period of the 1940s and ’50s.
Set in a sleazy town along the U.S.-Mexico border, Touch of Evil features a Mexican narcotics officer (played by Charlton Heston) whose honeymoon is interrupted by his sudden involvement in a murder case. In attempting to run his own investigations, he establishes a confrontational relationship with a crooked police captain (played by Welles) whose methods of enforcing the law often include breaking it. Heston’s new wife (played by Janet Leigh) finds herself a liability to her husband when she is kidnapped and framed by hoodlums working for Welles’s cop.
