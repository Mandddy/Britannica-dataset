Lon Chaney, original name Alonso Chaney   (born April 1, 1883, Colorado Springs, Colo., U.S.—died Aug. 26, 1930, Los Angeles, Calif.) American film actor, called the “Man of a Thousand Faces,” whose macabre characterizations are classics of the silent screen.
Chaney’s skills as a silent-film actor were honed during his childhood, when he learned to communicate with his deaf parents through facial expression, pantomime, and sign language. As a youth, he worked several odd jobs before turning to acting at age 19 in a play he cowrote with his brother. After a few years of touring with the show to only moderate success, Chaney met actress-singer Cleva Creighton in 1905; the two married and toured together in a stage act that later included their son, Creighton. Chaney eventually found more steady work on his own as an actor, stage manager, and choreographer, but his stage career was derailed when Cleva’s suicide attempt in 1913 created a public scandal. It was in the same year that Chaney made his debut in motion pictures, the medium in which he became a legend.
