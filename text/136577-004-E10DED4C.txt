Mo’Nique, in full Mo’Nique Imes-Hicks, byname of Monique Imes  (born December 11, 1967, Woodlawn, Maryland, U.S.) American actress, stand-up comedian, and talk-show host known for her bawdy humour and dramatic gravitas.
Mo’Nique, the youngest of four children, was raised in Baltimore county. At her brother’s suggestion, she took to the stage during an open-microphone night at a comedy club in 1988. Encouraged by the success of her impromptu performance, she began performing professionally at other comedy clubs in Baltimore, Atlanta, and along the East Coast. Eventually, she left her position as a customer-service representative for a telecommunications company to pursue a full-time career in stand-up comedy, and she was soon opening for musicians and appearing in such television specials as Russell Simmons’ Def Comedy Jam and Comic View.
