Harriot Stanton was a daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and early absorbed a reformer’s zeal from her and from her father, Henry B. Stanton, an abolitionist, a politician, and a journalist. She graduated from Vassar College in 1878. After a year at the Boston School of Oratory and another traveling in Europe, she assisted her mother and Susan B.

Her principal contribution to the work was a hundred-page chapter on Lucy Stone’s American Woman Suffrage Association, rival of Stanton’s and Anthony’s National Woman Suffrage Association.
