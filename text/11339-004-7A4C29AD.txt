Madeleine Guimard,  (baptized Dec. 27, 1743, Paris, Fr.—died May 4, 1816, Paris) leading ballerina at the Paris Opéra for nearly 30 years.
Guimard was dancing at the Comédie-Française at the age of 15 but soon transferred to the Opéra. While understudying Marie Allard, she replaced her in the role of Terpsichore in Les Fêtes grecques et romaines (1762) and, with her light, delicate steps, won immediate recognition. Made premiere danseuse in 1763, she appeared in Jean-Philippe Rameau’s Castor et Pollux and, with her clear and expressive pantomime, was an ideal performer in Jean-Georges Noverre’s dramatic ballets, excelling in Les Caprices de Galatée and Médée et Jason. Nevertheless, she supported her colleague Maximilien Gardel, whose La Chercheuse d’esprit was her favourite ballet, in opposing Noverre’s engagement as ballet master at the Opéra.
