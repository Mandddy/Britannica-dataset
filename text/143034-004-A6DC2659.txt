Incunabula, singular incunabulum,  books printed during the earliest period of typography—i.e., from the invention of the art of typographic printing in Europe in the 1450s to the end of the 15th century (i.e., January 1501). Such works were completed at a time when books—some of which were still being hand-copied—were sought by an increasingly large number of readers.
The year 1500 as the limit of the period of incunabula was first adopted in 1643 by Johann Saubert in his history of the Nürnberg library (Historia Bibliothecae Noribergensis), which includes the first known catalog of a collection of such books. The limit is convenient but arbitrary, since no special development in the printing art can be connected with it.
