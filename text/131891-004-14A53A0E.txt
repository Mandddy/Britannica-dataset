Casebearing leaf beetle (subfamily Cryptocephalinae and Lamprosomatinae), any member of two groups within the leaf beetle family, Chrysomelidae (insect order Coleoptera). As she lays her eggs, the female covers each one with a layer of excrement. After the larvae hatch, they retain this covering (case) as camouflage and add to it throughout their larval life. When disturbed, the adults pull in their legs and, because of their colour and shape, resemble caterpillar droppings and are ignored by predators. The European species Clythra quadripunicata and the North American Coscinoptera dominicana live in ant nests and feed on plant debris.
