Attica, Modern Greek Attikí,  ancient district of east-central Greece; Athens was its chief city. Bordering the sea on the south and east, Attica attracted maritime trade. In early times there were several independent settlements there, centring on Eleusis, Athens, and Marathon. Athens may have been paramount in the Mycenaean age, but in the historical period it did not completely control Attica until the 7th century. The modern department (nomós) of Attica has its administrative centre at Athens (Modern Greek: Athína) and extends farther west than the ancient district, taking in Megara on the Isthmus of Corinth (Korinthiakós).
