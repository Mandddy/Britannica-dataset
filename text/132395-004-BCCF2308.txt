Hans Baldung, also called Baldung-Grien  (born c. 1484, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Württemberg [Germany]—died 1545, Imperial Free City of Strasbourg [now Strasbourg, France]) painter and graphic artist, one of the most outstanding figures in northern Renaissance art. He served as an assistant to Albrecht Dürer, whose influence is apparent in his early works, although the demonic energy of his later style is closer to that of Matthias Grünewald.
Baldung was born into a successful family of doctors and lawyers that immigrated to Strasbourg from Swabia in the 1490s. He probably received his early artistic training in Strasbourg before entering Albrecht Dürer’s workshop in Nürnberg about 1503. The “Grien” element that is sometimes seen in his name was apparently an early nickname. After moving to Halle in 1507, he received commissions to produce the altarpieces Epiphany, or Adoration of the Magi, and St. Sebastian (1507), which were later displayed in the Collegiate Church there.
