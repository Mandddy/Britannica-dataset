Kildare, Irish Cill Dara,  county in the province of Leinster, east-central Ireland. It comprises part of the lowland west of the Wicklow Mountains and part of the Irish central lowland. Naas, in east-central Kildare, is the county town (seat).
County Kildare is bounded by Counties Meath (north); Fingal, South Dublin, and Wicklow (east); Carlow (south); and Laoighis and Offaly (west). The River Liffey forms a gorge at Pollaphuca and runs west into the Kildare lowland, northwest to Newbridge, and northeast to Celbridge and Leixlip. The River Barrow forms much of the countyâ€™s western boundary. Glacial deposits cover much of the surface of Kildare, and soils are varied; more than four-fifths of the area is farmland.
