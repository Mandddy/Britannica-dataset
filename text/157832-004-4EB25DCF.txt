Roger Corman, in full Roger William Corman  (born April 5, 1926, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.) American motion picture director, producer, and distributor known for his highly successful low-budget exploitation films and for launching the careers of several prominent directors and actors, notably Francis Ford Coppola, Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, and Jonathan Demme.
In 1940 Corman’s family moved from Detroit to Beverly Hills, California, near Hollywood—a move that inspired young Roger’s love of motion pictures. After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Corman earned an engineering degree from Stanford University. He broke into the film industry in 1948, where he began working as a messenger at Twentieth Century-Fox. He was soon promoted to script reader. After a one-year hiatus during which he studied English literature at the University of Oxford, he coproduced his first film, Highway Dragnet, in 1954.
