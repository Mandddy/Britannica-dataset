Jean-Martin Charcot,  (born Nov. 29, 1825, Paris, France—died  Aug. 16, 1893, Morvan) founder (with Guillaume Duchenne) of modern neurology and one of France’s greatest medical teachers and clinicians.
Charcot took his M.D. at the University of Paris in 1853 and three years later was appointed physician of the Central Hospital bureau. He then became a professor at the University of Paris (1860–93), where he began a lifelong association with the Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris (1862); there, in 1882, he opened what was to become the greatest neurological clinic of the time in Europe. A teacher of extraordinary competence, he attracted students from all parts of the world. In 1885 one of his students was Sigmund Freud, and it was Charcot’s employment of hypnosis in an attempt to discover an organic basis for hysteria that stimulated Freud’s interest in the psychological origins of neurosis.
