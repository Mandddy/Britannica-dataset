Giant water bug,  any wide and flat-bodied aquatic insect of the family Belostomatidae (order Heteroptera). This family, although containing only about 100 species, includes the largest bugs in the order: sometimes exceeding 10 cm (4 inches) in the South American species Lethocerus grandis and ranging between 2 and 5 cm in northern climates. These insects are usually seen suspended in a quiet pond or lake, the tip of their abdomen piercing the water surface and the brown, oval body hanging below.
The front legs are adapted for grasping prey; the hind pair is flat and oarlikeâ€”adapted for swimming. Giant water bugs feed on insects, salamanders, tadpoles, snails, and even small fishes. Because they are attracted to light these insects are sometimes called electric-light bugs. When disturbed, some species play dead; others emit an odorous fluid from the anus; and still others make a soft chirping sound.
