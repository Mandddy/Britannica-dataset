Fungus weevil (family Anthribidae), any of approximately 3,000 species of weevils (insect order Coleoptera) whose adults are usually found on dead twigs or fungi and whose larvae feed on fungi, seeds, or deadwood. These insects are between 0.5 and 50 mm (0.02 and 2 inches) long, and the head is prolonged to form a short beak called a snout.
Some species have antennae that may be longer than the body, whereas others have short antennae. The antennae are not elbowed as in the true weevils (Curculionidae). Fungus weevils occur mainly in the tropics. The coffee bean weevil (Araecerus fasciculatus) is an important pest.
