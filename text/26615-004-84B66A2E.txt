Architectural rendering, branch of the pictorial arts and of architectural design whose special aim is to show, before buildings have been built, how they will look when completed. Modern renderings fall into two main categories: the quick perspective “design-study,” by which an architect records or develops his initial concept of a proposed building, and the carefully executed “presentation rendering,” which is a final design made for exhibition and publication.
In the 1st century bce, Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius referred to the use of architectural renderings in antiquity, although no examples have survived. Some architectural sketches in perspective do remain from the Middle Ages—e.g., the famous sketchbook of Villard de Honnecourt, a French master mason of the 13th century. But architectural rendering as it is known today did not begin until the Renaissance, with such Italian architects as Filippo Brunelleschi, Leon Battista Alberti, Baldassarre Peruzzi, Donato Bramante, the Sangallos, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo. In the 19th century the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris led in perfecting an academic type of rendering that involved the addition to carefully drawn plans and elevations of washes in monotone or colour, so applied as to elucidate and enhance the presentation. In the late 20th century, however, the production of these carefully hand-drawn images gave way to computer graphics that enabled highly sophisticated and realistic three-dimensional images.
