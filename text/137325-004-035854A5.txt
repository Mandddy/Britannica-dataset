Varnish tree, also called Japanese varnish tree, Chinese lacquer tree, lacquer tree, or wood oil tree,  any of various trees whose milky juice is used to make a varnish or lacquer. The term is applied particularly to an Asian tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), related to poison ivy, that is highly irritating to the skin. On being tapped, the tree exudes a thick, milky emulsion that was possibly used as the first drying oil; it has the peculiar property of drying only in a moist atmosphere. From this exudate comes the lacquer used to produce the highly polished woodenware of China and Japan with hard and durable coats unaffected by water.
