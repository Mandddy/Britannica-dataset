Henry Howard Molyneux Herbert, 4th earl of Carnarvon,  (born June 24, 1831, London—died  June 28, 1890, London) British statesman, a liberally inclined member of Conservative Party governments, who tried, with varying success, to establish federal self-government in British overseas possessions.
He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, inheriting his father’s earldom in 1849. He was undersecretary for the colonies in 1858–59 and served two terms as colonial secretary (1866–67 and 1874–78). In his first term he realized his greatest achievement—passage of the British North America Act (1867), which gave Canada its federal system and dominion status. In his second term of office, however, his 1875 proposal for a South African federation on the Canadian pattern failed. In 1878 he proposed the so-called Carnarvon Terms, which a few years later provided the settlement of a major dispute between Canada and the British that had delayed the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
