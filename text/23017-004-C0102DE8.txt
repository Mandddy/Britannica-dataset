The Smiths, one of the most popular and critically acclaimed English bands of the 1980s. The original members were lead singer Morrissey (original name Steven Patrick Morrissey; b. May 22, 1959, Manchester, England), guitarist Johnny Marr (original name John Maher; b. October 31, 1963, Manchester), bassist Andy Rourke (b. 1963, Manchester), and drummer Mike Joyce (b. June 1, 1963, Manchester).
Prime exponents of British alternative rock, the Smiths were based around the unlikely partnership of singer-lyricist Morrissey (a reclusive bookworm inspired as much by Oscar Wilde as by his glam-rock heroes the New York Dolls) and budding guitar hero Marr. With drummer Joyce and bassist Rourke completing the lineup, the band burst on the Manchester scene and quickly won a cult following with sessions recorded for British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio, live shows, and the plangent folk-punk of their debut single, “Hand in Glove.” Signed to the prominent independent label Rough Trade, the Smiths scored several U.K. hits, notably “This Charming Man” and “What Difference Does It Make?” Morrissey’s flamboyant stage presence, forlorn croon, and compellingly conflicted persona (loudly proclaimed celibacy offset by coy hints of closeted homosexuality) made him a peculiar heartthrob, and songs such as “Still Ill” sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth. But Morrissey’s “woe-is-me” posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as “miserabilists.”
