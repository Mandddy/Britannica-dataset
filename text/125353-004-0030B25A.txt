Battle of Manila Bay, (May 1, 1898), defeat of the Spanish Pacific fleet by the U.S. Navy, resulting in the fall of the Philippines and contributing to the final U.S. victory in the Spanish–American War. After the United States had declared war (April 25), its Asiatic squadron was ordered from Hong Kong to “capture or destroy the Spanish fleet” then in Philippine waters. The U.S. Navy was well trained and well supplied, largely through the energetic efforts of the young assistant secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, who had selected Commo. George Dewey for the command of the Asiatic squadron. In one morning’s engagement (May 1), the guns of Dewey’s squadron completely destroyed the Spanish ships anchored in Manila Bay. (Spanish casualties numbered 381; American, fewer than 10.) After token bombardment, Manila surrendered and was occupied by the U.S. Army on August 13. The Battle of Manila Bay made Commodore Dewey a national hero and helped establish the reputation of the United States as a major naval power.
