Volturno River, Italian Fiume Volturno, Latin Volturnus,  river, south-central Italy. It rises in the Abruzzese Apennines near Alfedena and flows southeast as far as its junction with the Calore River near Caiazzo. It then turns southwest, past Capua, to enter the Tyrrhenian Sea at Castel Volturno, northwest of Naples. The river is 109 miles (175 km) long and has a drainage basin of 2,100 square miles (5,450 square km). In the 1950s a dam was built a short distance upstream from Capua, regulating the Volturnoâ€™s discharge and creating a reliable supply of irrigation water.
Since the Volturno flows at right angles to the main roads connecting Rome and Naples, it has had considerable military importance. During the wars for Italian unity, the Italian nationalist leader Giuseppe Garibaldi defeated a Neapolitan army there in 1860. During World War II, German forces in southern Italy used the Volturno as their line of defense after the fall of Naples, until the U.S. 5th Army crossed the river on Oct. 13, 1943. The upper Volturno River valley fell into Allied hands with the capture of Isernia by the British on Nov. 8, 1943.
