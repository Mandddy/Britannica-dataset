Barbecue,  an outdoor meal, usually a form of social entertainment, at which meats, fish, or fowl, along with vegetables, are roasted over a wood or charcoal fire. The term also denotes the grill or stone-lined pit for cooking such a meal, or the food itself, particularly the strips of meat. The word “barbecue” came into English via the Spanish, who adopted the term from the Arawak Indians of the Caribbean, to whom the barbacoa was a grating of green wood upon which strips of meat were placed to cook or to dry over a slow fire.
Barbecuing is popular throughout the United States, especially in the South, where pork is the favoured meat, and in the Southwest, where beef predominates. Other foods barbecued are lamb or kid, chicken, sausages, and, along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, seafood. Basting and marinating sauces also reflect regional tastes, vinegar-based sauces in the Carolinas, tomato-based in the West and Midwest, and the spiciest versions in the Southwest.
