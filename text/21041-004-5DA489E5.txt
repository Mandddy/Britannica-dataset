Simon Kuznets, in full Simon Smith Kuznets  (born April 30 [April 17, Old Style], 1901, Kharkov, Ukraine, Russian Empire [now Kharkiv, Ukraine]—died July 8, 1985, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.) Russian-born American economist and statistician who won the 1971 Nobel Prize for Economics.
Kuznets immigrated to the United States in 1922, 15 years after the arrival there of his father (who changed the family name to Smith, though the young Kuznets preferred the original name). He was educated at Columbia University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1926. In 1927 he joined the National Bureau of Economic Research, working with its founder, Wesley Mitchell. It was there that Kuznets developed his pioneering studies of U.S. national income and his more general work on economic time series, resulting in comprehensive studies of the economic growth of nations. His study of American national income began with statistics from 1869, encompassing a long-term approach that had never been attempted. Out of this work came an understanding of how to measure gross national product (GNP). Kuznets’s research set high standards for all similar studies that would follow. After his work with the federal government, Kuznets taught at the University of Pennsylvania (1930–54), Johns Hopkins University (1954–60), and Harvard University (1960–71).
