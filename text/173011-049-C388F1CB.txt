Phobos, the inner and larger of Mars’s two moons. It was discovered telescopically with its companion moon, Deimos, by the American astronomer Asaph Hall in 1877 and named for one of the sons of Ares, the Greek counterpart of the Roman god Mars. Phobos is a small irregular rocky object with a crater-scarred, grooved surface.
A roughly ellipsoidal body, Phobos measures 26.6 km (16.5 miles) across at its widest point. It revolves once around Mars every 7 hours 39 minutes at an exceptionally close mean distance—9,378 km (5,827 miles)—in a nearly circular orbit that lies only 1° from the planet’s equatorial plane. Because the satellite’s orbital period is less than the rotational period of Mars (24 hours 37 minutes), Phobos moves from west to east in the Martian sky. The long axis of Phobos constantly points toward Mars; as with Earth’s Moon, it has a rotational period equal to its orbital period and so keeps the same face to the planet.
