Blind mole rat (subfamily Spalacinae), any of eight species of burrowing rodents living in the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea regions. Among the several rodents referred to as “mole rats” (see zokor), the blind mole rat is among the most molelike in form, having a furred, cylindrical body, short limbs, and protruding incisor teeth. The feet and claws are surprisingly small for such a highly specialized burrower. Blind mole rats appear eyeless and earless, as the functioning remnants of these structures are covered by fur and are therefore not visible. The tiny eyes are hidden beneath the skin, and the external ears are reduced to slight folds. Sensory bristles extending rearward from the flattened, padded nose toward the eyes give the head a keeled, wedgelike shape. Like the eyes and ears, the animal’s minute stub of a tail is not visible externally.
Blind mole rats are medium-sized, weighing 100 to 570 grams (3.5 ounces to 1.3 pounds), with bodies about 13 to 35 cm (5.1 to 13.8 inches) long. The dense, soft fur may be pale to reddish brown or buff gray on the upperparts; underparts are grayish or buff brown. The front of the head is usually paler than the back and may exhibit white or yellow stripes, which can extend along the sides of the head or run down the middle of it from nose to forehead.
