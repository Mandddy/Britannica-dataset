Felix Frankfurter,  (born Nov. 15, 1882, Vienna, Austria-Hungary—died  Feb. 22, 1965, Washington, D.C., U.S.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1939–62), a noted scholar and teacher of law, who was in his time the high court’s leading exponent of the doctrine of judicial self-restraint. He held that judges should adhere closely to precedent, disregarding their own opinions, and decide only “whether legislators could in reason have enacted such a law.”
Frankfurter was the son of a Jewish merchant who left Vienna for New York in 1893. Young Frankfurter was educated at the City College of New York and at the Harvard Law School, where he later taught (1914–39). He served as assistant to Henry L. Stimson when Stimson was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York (1906–09) and secretary of war under President William Howard Taft (1911–13). Frankfurter’s influence on President Franklin D. Roosevelt was largely responsible for Stimson’s return (1940) as head of the War Department during World War II.
