Battles of Cold Harbor, two engagements of the American Civil War at Cold Harbor, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital.
The first battle (June 27, 1862), sometimes called the Battle of Gaines’s Mill, was part of the Seven Days’ Battles (June 25–July 1), which ended the Peninsular Campaign (April 4–July 1), the large-scale Union effort to take Richmond. After fighting at Mechanicsville and Beaver Dam Creek, General George B. McClellan ordered Union troops to high ground between Gaines’s Mill and Cold Harbor. When Confederate General Robert E. Lee attacked on June 27, the Union troops were driven back in disorder and withdrew to the south side of the Chickahominy River.
