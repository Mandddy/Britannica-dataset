Louis Alexander Mountbatten, 1st marquess of Milford Haven, also called (until 1917) Louis Alexander, Prince Of Battenberg   (born May 24, 1854, Graz, Austriaâ€”died  Sept. 11, 1921, London, Eng.) British admiral of the fleet and first sea lord, who was responsible, with Winston Churchill, for the total mobilization of the fleet prior to World War I.
The eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse, he was naturalized as a British subject in 1868, when he entered the Royal Navy. He took part in the British invasion of Egypt in 1882, including the bombardment of Alexandria (July 11). After serving as director of naval intelligence, he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1904 and vice admiral in 1908. He commanded the Atlantic Fleet from 1908 to 1910 and became first sea lord in 1912. As such he was charged with readying the fleet for war. After a test mobilization in July 1914, he ordered (with instructions from Churchill, first lord of the Admiralty) the reserve ships to remain in full commission; thus, the fleet was wholly mobilized on Aug. 3, 1914, the day before Great Britain entered World War I.
