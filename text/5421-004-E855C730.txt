Bella Akhmadulina, in full Izabella Akhatovna Akhmadulina   (born April 10, 1937, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died Nov. 29, 2010, Peredelkino, Russia) Russian-language poet of Tatar and Italian descent, a distinctive voice in post-Stalinist Soviet literature.
Akhmadulina completed her education at the Gorky Literary Institute in 1960, after which she traveled in Central Asia. She was eventually admitted to the Soviet Writers’ Union, although her uncompromisingly individualistic work elicited official criticism and met with some difficulty in publication. Like her fellow poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, to whom she was married during the 1950s, she drew audiences of thousands at readings of her work.
