James Bruce, 8th earl of Elgin, in full James Bruce, 8th earl of Elgin, 12th earl of Kincardine  (born July 20, 1811, London—died  Nov. 20, 1863, Dharmsala, India) British statesman and governor general of British North America in 1847–54 who effected responsible, or cabinet, government in Canada and whose conduct in office defined the role for his successors.
Bruce had been elected to the British House of Commons for Southampton as a liberal Tory in 1841, but later that year he inherited his father’s title (Scottish peerage) and left the Commons. In 1842 he was appointed governor of Jamaica. In 1846 he was named governor general of British North America and given the task of implementing the policy of responsible government recommended by his father-in-law, John George Lambton, 1st earl of Durham. He worked with the existing government of the Province of Canada until its defeat in the 1848 general election, when he supported the next administration’s Rebellion Losses Act (1849), which compensated all Canadians for losses incurred during an 1837 rebellion in Lower Canada. His stand attracted strong Tory opposition; Elgin himself was stoned (though uninjured) by a mob, and the Parliament buildings in Montreal were burned.
