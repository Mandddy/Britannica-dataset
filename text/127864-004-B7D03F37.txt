Winter hazel,  any of about 10 species of the genus Corylopsis, deciduous shrubs or small trees of the witch hazel family (Hamamelidaceae). They are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayas but are planted elsewhere as ornamentals. Their bell-shaped creamy to yellow fragrant flowers appear in hanging clusters in early spring before the leaves. Especially early are the creamy flowers of the buttercup winter hazel (C. pauciflora), which appear in clusters of two or three on the densely branched shrubs up to 2 m (6 feet) tall. Spike winter hazel (C. spicata), about the same height, blooms about the same time but bears lemon-yellow flowers. The fragrant winter hazel (C. glabrescens), up to 6 m tall, is somewhat hardier than the aforementioned species.
