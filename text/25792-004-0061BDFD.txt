Francisco Gómez de Quevedo y Villegas,  (born Sept. 17, 1580, Madrid, Spain—died  Sept. 8, 1645, Villanueva de los Infantes) poet and master satirist of Spain’s Golden Age, who, as a virtuoso of language, is unequaled in Spanish literature.
Quevedo was born to a family of wealth and distinction. He studied at the universities of Alcalá and Valladolid from 1596 to 1606, was versed in several languages, and by the age of 23 had distinguished himself as a poet and wit. His elder contemporaries, Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega, both expressed their esteem for his poetry, but Quevedo was more interested in a political career. In 1613 he became a counsellor to the Duke de Osuna, viceroy of Sicily and later of Naples, whom he served with distinction for seven years. On the ascension of Philip IV of Spain, Osuna fell from favour and Quevedo was placed under house arrest. He thereafter refused political appointment and devoted himself to writing, producing a steady stream of satirical verse and prose aimed at the follies of his contemporaries. In 1639 he was again arrested, supposedly for a satirical poem, and was confined in a monastery. Released in 1643, broken in health, he died shortly after.
