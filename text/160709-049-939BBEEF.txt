Sundial, the earliest type of timekeeping device, which indicates the time of day by the position of the shadow of some object exposed to the sunâ€™s rays. As the day progresses, the sun moves across the sky, causing the shadow of the object to move and indicating the passage of time.
The first device for indicating the time of day was probably the gnomon, dating from about 3500 bce. It consisted of a vertical stick or pillar, and the length of the shadow it cast gave an indication of the time of day. By the 8th century bce more-precise devices were in use. The earliest known sundial still preserved is an Egyptian shadow clock of green schist dating at least from this period. The shadow clock consists of a straight base with a raised crosspiece at one end. The base, on which is inscribed a scale of six time divisions, is placed in an east-west direction with the crosspiece at the east end in the morning and at the west end in the afternoon. The shadow of the crosspiece on this base indicates the time. Clocks of this kind were still in use in modern times in parts of Egypt.
