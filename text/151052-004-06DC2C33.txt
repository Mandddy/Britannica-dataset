Someş River, Hungarian Szamos,  river, one of the most important in Transylvania, northwestern Romania. It has two headstreams: the Great Someş, which rises in the Rodnei Mountains and flows southwest, and the Little Someş, which rises in the Apuseni Mountains as the Someşu Cald and Someşu Rece and flows northeast. The two headstreams flow rapidly out of the mountains to meet at the town of Dej in the Transylvanian Basin. From there the river follows a zigzag course toward the northwest to enter the Tisza (Tisa) River in Hungary after a course of about 250 miles (400 km), including either headstream. Between Dej and the Tisza, the Someş is joined by several tributaries. The city of Satu Mare is located on the Someş.
