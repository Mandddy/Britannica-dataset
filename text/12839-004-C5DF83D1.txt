Clement V, original name Bertrand De Got   (born c. 1260, Bordelais region, France—died  April 20, 1314, Roquemaure, Provence) pope from 1305 to 1314 who in choosing Avignon, France, for the papal residence—where it flourished until 1377—became the first of the Avignonese popes.
Bishop of Comminges from March 1295, he became archbishop of Bordeaux in 1299. He was elected pope through the manipulation of King Philip IV the Fair of France at Perugia in 1305. By creating a majority of French cardinals, Clement assured a line of French popes. His own pontificate was marked by woe, much of it caused by Philip.
