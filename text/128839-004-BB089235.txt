Hydrolysis, in chemistry and physiology, a double decomposition reaction with water as one of the reactants. Thus, if a compound is represented by the formula AB in which A and B are atoms or groups and water is represented by the formula HOH, the hydrolysis reaction may be represented by the reversible chemical equation AB + HOH ⇌ AH + BOH. The reactants other than water, and the products of hydrolysis, may be neutral molecules—as in most hydrolyses involving organic compounds—or ionic molecules, as in hydrolyses of salts, acids, and bases.
Hydrolysis involving organic compounds may be illustrated by the reaction of water with an ester of a carboxylic acid; all such esters have the general formula RCO−OR′, in which R and R′ are combining groups (for example, if R and R′ both represent the methyl group, CH3, the ester is methyl acetate). The hydrolysis involves several steps, of which the slowest is the formation of a covalent bond between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and the carbon atom of the ester. In succeeding steps, which are very rapid, the carbon–oxygen bond of the ester breaks and hydrogen ions become detached from the original water molecule and attached to the nascent alcohol molecule. The whole reaction is represented by the equation RCO−OR′ + H2O →&nbsp;RCO−OH + R′−OH, in which RCO−OH denotes a molecule of a carboxylic acid, R′−OH denotes a molecule of an alcohol, and the dashes represent covalent bonds that are broken or formed during the reaction.
