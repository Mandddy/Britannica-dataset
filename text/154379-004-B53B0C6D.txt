Mario Draghi,  (born September 3, 1947, Rome, Italy) Italian economist who served from 2011 as president of the European Central Bank (ECB), the financial institution responsible for making monetary decisions within the euro zone, that portion of the European Union whose members have adopted the European common currency. Draghi’s appointment came at a critical time, when stability within the euro zone was being challenged by the European sovereign debt crisis.
Draghi was raised in Rome, where his father worked for the Bank of Italy (Italy’s central bank). After receiving a Jesuit secondary education and then graduating from the University of Rome, he studied economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States under Franco Modigliani, who later won the Nobel Prize for Economics, and Stanley Fischer, future head of the central bank of Israel. He received a Ph.D. from MIT in 1976, the first Italian to earn a doctorate at that institution. During the 1980s he taught economics at the University of Florence and worked for the World Bank in Washington, D.C.
