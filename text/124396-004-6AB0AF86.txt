Hanafuda, (Japanese: “flower cards”), deck of 48 cards divided into 12 suits of four cards. Each suit is named for a month of the year and pictures a flower identified with that month. The cards are tiny, only 21/8 by 11/4 inches (5.4 by 3.2 cm), but about three times thicker than Western cards.
Hanafuda evolved after the Portuguese took Western cards to Japan in the 17th century. Hanafuda cards bear no numbers or symbols, except for the flower pictures, to signify suit and rank. In most suits the first two cards show only a plain representation of the identifying flower and are worth one point. The suit’s third-ranking card adds a tanzaku, a picture of a sheet of paper for poetry writing, and is worth five points. The top card in each suit shows the flower, to which is added a picture of some animal, bird, evidence of mankind, or the Moon. These high cards are worth either 10 or 20 points.
