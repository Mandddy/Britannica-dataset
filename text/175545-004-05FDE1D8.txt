John Robert Schrieffer,  (born May 31, 1931, Oak Park, Illinois, U.S.) American physicist and winner, with John Bardeen and Leon N. Cooper, of the 1972 Nobel Prize for Physics for developing the BCS theory (for their initials), the first successful microscopic theory of superconductivity.
Schrieffer was educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where he received a Ph.D. in 1957. He was a young graduate student working under Bardeen at the University of Illinois when he helped explain why metals lose their electrical resistance at very low temperatures.
