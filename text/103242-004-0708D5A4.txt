Dublin, Irish Baile Átha Cliath,  geographic county in the province of Leinster, eastern Ireland. In 1994 it was replaced administratively by three counties—Fingal to the north, South Dublin to the southwest, and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown to the southeast—as well as by the city of Dublin itself, which was given the administrative level of both a city and a county. The limits of the former geographic county of Dublin are nearly coextensive with the Greater Dublin metropolitan area.
The area of the geographic county is bounded by Counties Kildare (west), Meath (west and north), and Wicklow (south) and by the Irish Sea (east). The central and northern parts of the region are low-lying, whereas low mountains occupy the southern reaches of it; the mountains are chiefly covered with heath and bog. The northern coast from Balbriggan to Howth has sandy shores but assumes a bolder aspect in the promontory of Howth. The chief river is the Liffey, which rises in the Wicklow Mountains a few miles southwest of Dublin city and flows through the city and into Dublin Bay.
