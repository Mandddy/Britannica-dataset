Carl Jonas Love Almqvist,  Almqvist also spelled Almquist   (born Nov. 28, 1793, Ed, near Stockholmâ€”died  Sept. 26, 1866, Bremen, Bremen) writer whose vast literary output, ranging from bizarre romanticism to bold realism, greatly influenced the development of Swedish literature. Although his work is uneven, he is a master of Swedish prose.
After studying at Uppsala, Almqvist entered the Department of Ecclesiastical Affairs in Stockholm. In 1823 he gave up his position and went to western Sweden to lead with a group of friends an idealized peasant existence patterned after the ideas of Rousseau. Two years later he returned to Stockholm, and from 1829 to 1841 was principal of an experimental secondary school. In 1851 he fled to the U.S. after being accused of fraud and the attempted murder of a moneylender. He returned to Europe in 1865.
