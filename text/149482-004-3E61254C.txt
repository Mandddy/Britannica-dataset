Orne River,  river, Basse-Normandie région, northern France. It is 94 miles (152 km) long and flows through Orne and Calvados départements to empty into the English Channel 8 miles (13 km) north-northeast of Caen. It rises in the Perche Hills, east of the city of Sées, after which it flows northwestward through Argentan and then westward through Putanges-Pont-Écrepin, below which it is dammed. Its course then runs through the Saint-Aubert gorges to Pont-d’Ouilly and Thury-Harcourt, traversing some of the most beautiful parts of a region sometimes called the Norman Switzerland. The river crosses pastureland to Caen, which is connected with the sea by a canal running parallel to the Orne and its estuary, along its left bank. Limestone from the formations that flank the lower course of the river was used to construct historic buildings in England, including the Tower of London and Norwich Cathedral.
