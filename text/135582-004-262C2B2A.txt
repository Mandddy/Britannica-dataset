Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, 2nd Baronet,  (born Sept. 4, 1843, London, Eng.—died  Jan. 26, 1911, London) British statesman and Radical member of Parliament who became a member of the Cabinet in William E. Gladstone’s second administration but was ruined at the height of his career when he was cited as corespondent in a divorce suit.
After leaving the University of Cambridge and making a world tour, Dilke was elected to Parliament in 1868 and took an extreme left-wing position, delivering a series of speeches strongly critical of the monarchy. From 1874 on, however, with the Liberals in opposition, he moved closer to his official leaders. In Gladstone’s second Liberal government, Dilke was finally promoted to the Cabinet as president of the Local Government Board in 1882.
