Elias Zerhouni, Elias Adam Zerhouni  (born April 1, 1951, Nedroma, Algeria) Algerian-born American radiologist who served as the 15th director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 2002 to 2008.
Zerhouni, who had seven siblings, was born in a small village in western Algeria. His father was a math professor. In 1953 the family moved to the city of Algiers, where Zerhouni earned Algerian and French baccalaureates before studying at the University of Algiers School of Medicine. Influenced by his maternal uncle, a well-known radiologist, Zerhouni chose radiology as his field, and after receiving his medical degree in 1975, he moved to the United States. Barely able to speak English, Zerhouni nonetheless earned a position as radiology resident at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, rising to chief resident in 1978 and joining the faculty a short time later. At Johns Hopkins, Zerhouni participated in research on computed tomography that led to a technique enabling radiologists to identify benign and malignant nodules in the lungs.
