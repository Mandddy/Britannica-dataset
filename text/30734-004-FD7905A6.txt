Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), freshwater tropical fish of the family Osphronemidae (order Perciformes), noted for the pugnacity of the males toward one another. The Siamese fighting fish, a native of Thailand, was domesticated there for use in contests. Combat consists mainly of fin nipping and is accompanied by a display of extended gill covers, spread fins, and intensified colouring.
The fish, elongated and slender, grows to a length of about 6.5 centimetres (2.5 inches). In the wild it is predominantly greenish or brown with moderately sized red fins; under domestication it has been bred with long flowing fins and in a variety of colours, such as red, green, blue, and lavender.
