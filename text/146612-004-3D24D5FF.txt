Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF), English French National Railways,  state-owned railroad system of France, formed in 1938. The first railroad in France, from Saint-Étienne to Andrézieux, opened in 1827. A line from Saint-Étienne to Lyon was completed in 1832. In 1840 France had about 300 miles (500 km) of railroad, and by 1870, 9,300 miles (15,500 km).
A highly centralized system developed with Paris as the hub, but several cross-country routes, such as Lyon to Nantes, Bordeaux to Lyon, and Calais to Basel, were also built. The system was effectively nationalized in 1938, when the Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Français (SNCF) took over the operations of the privately owned Est, Midi, Nord, Paris-Lyons-Mediterranean, and Paris-Orleans railways, as well as the railways in western France. The state was given 51 percent control and has subsidized the system heavily.
