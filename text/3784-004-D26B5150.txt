Frank Robinson,  (born Aug. 31, 1935, Beaumont, Texas, U.S.) American professional baseball player who became the first black manager in Major League Baseball.
As a youth, Robinson played sandlot and American Legion Junior League baseball in Oakland, Calif., and at McClymonds High School, where he also played football and basketball. The right-hander played third base and pitched occasionally. After graduation he was signed by the National League (NL) Cincinnati Reds and played with their minor league teams (third base and outfield) until he joined the parent club in 1956, the year he was awarded Rookie of the Year honours. Robinson won an NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1961, and he batted more than .300 in 5 of the 10 years before he was traded to the American League (AL) Baltimore Orioles in 1966. In his first season with Baltimore he won the Triple Crown—leading the league in home runs (49), runs batted in (122), and batting average (.316)—and he was named the 1966 AL MVP, becoming the first to win the award in both leagues. He remained with Baltimore through 1971 and then played with the NL Los Angeles Dodgers (1972) and the AL California Angels (1973–74) and Cleveland Indians (1974–76). With 586 career home runs, Robinson ranked fourth in home runs hit, after Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714), and Willie Mays (660) when he retired in 1976.
