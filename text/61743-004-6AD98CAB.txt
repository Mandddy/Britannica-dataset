Bonnie and Clyde, crime film, released in 1967, that pioneered a new era of filmmaking, tearing down barriers in the depiction of violence and sexuality.
The movie was based on the Great Depression-era robbery team known as Bonnie and Clyde. Clyde Barrow (played by Warren Beatty) turns a chance encounter with bored, small-town Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) into the opportunity to launch a notorious crime spree. The lovers ultimately team with Clydeâ€™s brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his timid wife, Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and a dim-witted henchman named C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard). The gang thwarts all police efforts to capture them, until a fateful encounter on a lonely country road.
