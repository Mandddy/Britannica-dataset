Chain store, any of two or more retail stores having the same ownership and selling the same lines of goods. Chain stores account for an important segment of retailing operations in the Americas, western Europe, and Japan. Together with the department store and the mail-order company, chain stores represent the first successful application of large-scale integrated methods to a form of retailing.
Regular chain stores must be distinguished from franchises and from voluntary or cooperative chains, in which the retail units preserve their individual ownership. The latter get to keep their own profits and bear their own financial losses, while in regular chains the central organization assumes full responsibility for the financial condition of its selling units.
