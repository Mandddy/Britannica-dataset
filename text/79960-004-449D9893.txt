Sir Jacob Epstein,  (born Nov. 10, 1880, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 21, 1959, London, Eng.) one of the leading portrait sculptors of the 20th century, whose work, though seldom innovative, was widely heralded for its perceptive depiction of the sitter’s character and its modeling technique.
Epstein’s early ambition was to be a painter, and he spent his adolescence sketching the teeming ghetto life of New York City, showing even then the obsession with human personality that distinguishes much of his mature work. Faulty eyesight forced him to abandon painting for sculpture, and, after studying for two years in Paris, he set up a sculpture studio in London in 1905. He soon began to make his way as a portrait sculptor, despite the public scandals caused by the nudity of his so-called Strand Statues (1907–08; destroyed 1937) and the debauched-looking angel on his memorial (1912) for the Irish writer Oscar Wilde.
