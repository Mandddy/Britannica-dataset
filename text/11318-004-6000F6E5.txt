Gwalior, city, northern Madhya Pradesh state, central India. It is situated about 75 miles (120 km) south of Agra. Gwalior is a cultural, industrial, and political centre and takes its name from the historic rock fortress that forms the centre of the city. It has been referred to as Gopa Parvat, Gopachal Durg, Gopagiri, and Gopadiri, all which mean “cowherd’s hill.” Pop. (2001) 827,026; (2011) 1,069,276.
The area in which Gwalior is situated was the core of Gwalior princely state. That state was once the domain of the Sindhia family, a Maratha dynasty that controlled much of northwestern India during the second half of the 18th century. The foundations of the Gwalior state were laid by Ranoji Sindhia about 1745, and the state reached its greatest extent under Sindhia Mahadaji (reigned 1761–94). Mahadaji was the ruler of a vast territory that included parts of central India and Hindustan proper (northern India), while his officers exacted tribute from the principal Rajput rulers, including those of Jaipur and Jodhpur. Under Mahadaji’s grandnephew, Daulat Rao, the Gwalior state lost considerable territory to the British in 1803 and 1818 after losing wars to them. The state came completely under British domination in the 1840s. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857–58, the Sindhia ruler of Gwalior remained loyal to the British, but his army joined the mutineers and temporarily occupied Gwalior city before being defeated.
