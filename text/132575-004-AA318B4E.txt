J. Paul Getty Museum, museum and research centre established by J. Paul Getty to house his large collection of artworks. The original museum occupied a wing added to his ranch house in Malibu, Calif., U.S. His collections soon outgrew that location, and in 1974 they were moved to a new building in Malibu, a lavish re-creation of a Roman villa uncovered at Herculaneum. This museum, known as the Getty Villa, was designed by the Boston-based architects Rodolfo Machado and Jorge Silvetti as a research centre and to hold Getty’s arts of the ancient world. On Getty’s death (1976) the museum became the most richly endowed in the world. Getty’s major collections now are housed in the Getty Center, a striking six-building complex in Los Angeles designed by Richard Meier, which opened with great publicity in 1997. The Getty Museum at the Getty Center includes European paintings, sculpture, drawings, and decorative arts to 1900, illuminated manuscripts, and photographs. The collections reflect Getty’s preference for paintings of the Renaissance and the Baroque period and for French furniture.
