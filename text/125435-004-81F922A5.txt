Drina River, river, central Balkans, southeastern Europe. It originates with the confluence of the Tara and Piva rivers and follows a northerly course 215 miles (346 km) to enter the Sava. Its upper course is through canyons and gorges, while its lower course is wider. The Drina constitutes a large part of the boundary that separates Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west from Serbia to the east. Two large man-made lakes, at Bajina Bašta and Zvornik, supply the power for hydroelectric stations. The Drina Basin, taking in 7,556 square miles (19,570 square km), has considerable hydroelectric potential. The upper Drina and tributaries are noted for freshwater fishing. Major cities are Višegrad and Zvornik, site of a hydroelectric plant; the former is the locale of the historical novel Na Drini ćuprija (1945; The Bridge on the Drina) by the Serbo-Croatian writer Ivo Andrić, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1961. Višegrad is also where the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge crosses the Drina River. Designed by the Ottoman architect Sinan in the 16th century, the bridge was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007.
