Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), radio telescope system located on the Chajnantor plateau in Chileâ€™s Atacama Desert at an altitude of 5,000 metres (16,500 feet). When completed in 2013, ALMA will consist of 66 parabolic dishes, 54 of which are 12 metres (39 feet) in diameter and 12 of which are 7 metres (23 feet) in diameter. ALMA began observations in 2011 with 16 12-metre dishes. Its frequency coverage ranges between 84 and 720 gigahertz (or wavelengths between 0.42 and 3.6 mm). The radio telescope is an international partnership operated by the U.S. National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the European Southern Observatory, and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. The radio signals received by the individual dishes can be integrated to give a resolving power equal to that of a single dish as large as 16 km (10 miles) in diameter. Its high angular resolution and large collecting area will allow observation of radiation at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths emitted by distant galaxies formed shortly after the big bang. The array will also be able to detect radiation emitted by dust and gas at the time of formation of extrasolar planets.
