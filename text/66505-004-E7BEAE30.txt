Clifford Odets,  (born July 18, 1906, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died August 14, 1963, Hollywood, California) leading dramatist of the theatre of social protest in the United States during the 1930s. His important affiliation with the celebrated Group Theatre contributed to that company’s considerable influence on the American stage.
From 1923 to 1928 Odets learned his profession as an actor in repertory companies; in 1931 he joined the newly founded Group Theatre as one of its original members. Odets’s Waiting for Lefty (1935), his first great success, used both auditorium and stage for action and was an effective plea for labour unionism; Awake and Sing (1935) is a naturalistic family drama; and Golden Boy (1937; filmed 1939) concerns an Italian youth who rejects his artistic potential to become a boxer. Paradise Lost (1935) deals with the tragic life of a middle-class family. In 1936 Odets married the Austrian actress Luise Rainer.
