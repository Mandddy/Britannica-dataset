Frank Borzage,  (born April 23, 1893, Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.â€”died June 19, 1962, Los Angeles, California) American motion-picture director and producer noted for his romantic transcendentalism and technically impeccable filmmaking.
He was the son of a master stonemason. Borzage began acting in his teens with a theatrical troupe, doubling as a prop boy before entering films as an actor in 1912 for producer and director Thomas Ince. After appearing in a number of westerns and comedies, he began directing films at the American Film Manufacturing Company in 1915. He worked as an actor and director primarily for Triangle Film Corporation from 1917 to 1919, where in 1918 he switched to directing exclusively. In the early 1920s he worked at Paramount Pictures, First National Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). He finally landed at Fox Film Corporation, the scene of his greatest triumphs, in 1925. There he began with Lazybones, a melancholy romance set in a small town in the American West, though he soon moved over to domestic comedies such as Wages for Wives (1925) and Early to Wed (1926).
