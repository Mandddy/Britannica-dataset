Merritt Lyndon Fernald,  (born Oct. 5, 1873, Orono, Maine, U.S.—died Sept. 22, 1950, Cambridge, Mass.) American botanist noted for his comprehensive study of the flora of the northeastern United States.
The publication of Fernald’s first paper, at age 17, brought him to the attention of Sereno Watson, then head of the Gray Herbarium at Cambridge, Mass. Watson invited Fernald to work as a helper in the herbarium while he attended the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University (B.S., 1897). Fernald remained at Harvard throughout his professional career as instructor, professor, and the curator and director of the Gray Herbarium.
