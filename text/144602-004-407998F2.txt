Pat Summitt, née Patricia Head  (born June 14, 1952, Clarksville, Tennessee, U.S.—died June 27, 2016, Knoxville, Tennessee) American collegiate women’s basketball coach at the University of Tennessee (1974–2012) who led the squad to eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships (1987, 1989, 1991, 1996–98, and 2007–08) and compiled more wins (1,098) than any other Division I college basketball (men’s or women’s) coach in NCAA history.
She grew up on a dairy farm, where she developed the toughness that would become her trademark. She first played basketball in a hayloft, and her aggressive and instinctive play at the University of Tennessee at Martin (B.S., 1974; M.S., 1975) earned her spots on national teams. In 1975 she won gold at the Pan-American Games and the following year overcame a serious knee injury to cocaptain the U.S. Olympic team to a silver medal in Montreal. Soon afterward she retired as a player to concentrate on coaching.
