Leopold Kronecker,  (born December 7, 1823, Liegnitz, Prussia [now Legnica, Poland]—died December 29, 1891, Berlin, Germany) German mathematician whose primary contributions were in the theory of equations and higher algebra.
Kronecker acquired a passion for number theory from Ernst Kummer, his instructor in mathematics at the Liegnitz Gymnasium, and earned his doctor’s degree at the University of Berlin with a dissertation (1845) on those special complex units that appear in certain algebraic number fields. He managed the family mercantile and land business until age 30, when he was financially able to retire. While in business he pursued mathematics as a recreation. From 1861 to 1883 Kronecker lectured at the University of Berlin, and in 1883 he succeeded Kummer as professor there.
