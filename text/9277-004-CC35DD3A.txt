Sir Henry Morton Stanley, original name John Rowlands, Congolese byname Bula Matari (“Breaker of Rocks”)  (born January 28, 1841, Denbigh, Denbighshire, Wales—died May 10, 1904, London, England) British American explorer of central Africa, famous for his rescue of the Scottish missionary and explorer David Livingstone and for his discoveries in and development of the Congo region. He was knighted in 1899.
Stanley’s parents, John Rowlands and Elizabeth Parry, gave birth to him out of wedlock. He grew up partly in the charge of reluctant relatives, partly in St. Asaph Workhouse. Modern research has shown his own account of ill treatment and a dramatic escape to be almost entirely a fantasy. There seem to have been no extraordinary events attending his departure from the workhouse at age 15, after receiving a reasonable education. The humiliations of institutional life and his mother’s consistent neglect did, however, leave deep marks on his personality. After an interlude of dependence on relatives, he sailed from Liverpool as a cabin boy and landed at New Orleans in 1859.
