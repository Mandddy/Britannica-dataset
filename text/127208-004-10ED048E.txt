Christian Bale, in full Christian Charles Philip Bale  (born January 30, 1974, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales) Welsh-born English actor who was known for his portrayal of complex, psychologically tormented characters.
Bale made his big-screen debut, with little formal training as an actor, at age 13 in Empire of the Sun (1987). He received an overwhelming amount of attention for his role, and thereafter he became intensely private, striving to keep his personal life out of the media limelight. Bale appeared in such popular youth-oriented films as Newsies (1992), Swing Kids (1993), and Little Women (1994), for which actress Winona Ryder handpicked him to play Laurie. Bale also provided the voice of Thomas for the Disney animated movie Pocahontas (1995) and played Jesus of Nazareth in the made-for-television movie Mary, Mother of Jesus (1999). His performance as serial killer Patrick Bateman in American Psycho (2000) brought Bale additional attention.
