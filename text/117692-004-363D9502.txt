Giorgio Armani,  (born July 11, 1934, Piacenza, Italy) Italian fashion designer whose signature style of relaxed yet luxurious ready-to-wear and elegant, intricately beaded evening wear helped introduce ease and streamlined modernity to late 20th-century dressing.
The son of a shipping manager, Armani intended to become a doctor but left medical school to pursue a career in fashion. Beginning in 1957 he worked as a buyer for the Milan department store La Rinascente. After a seven-year stint in that position, he began to pursue a career in fashion design, training in the atelier of Nino Cerruti. In 1975, with the help of his friend and business partner Sergio Galeotti, Armani launched his own label of ready-to-wear for men and women.
