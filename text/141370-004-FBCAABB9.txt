James J. Hill, in full James Jerome Hill  (born September 16, 1838, near Guelph, Ontario, Canada—died May 29, 1916, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.) American financier and railroad builder who helped expand rail networks in the northwestern United States.
After settling in St. Paul, Minnesota, about 1870, he established transportation lines on the Mississippi and Red rivers and arranged a traffic interchange with the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. On that line’s failure in 1873, Hill interested Canadian capitalists and reorganized it as the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway Company, becoming its president in 1882.
