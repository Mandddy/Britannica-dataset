Arna Bontemps, in full Arna Wendell Bontemps   (born October 13, 1902, Alexandria, Louisiana, U.S.—died June 4, 1973, Nashville, Tennessee) American writer who depicted the lives and struggles of black Americans.
After graduating from Pacific Union College, Angwin, California, in 1923, Bontemps taught in New York and elsewhere. His poetry began to appear in the influential black magazines Opportunity and Crisis in the mid-1920s. His first novel, God Sends Sunday (1931), about a jockey who was good with horses but inadequate with people, is considered the final work of the Harlem Renaissance. The novel was dramatized as St. Louis Woman (1946), in collaboration with the poet Countee Cullen. Bontemps’s next two novels were about slave revolts—in Virginia in Black Thunder (1936) and in Haiti in Drums at Dusk (1939). In 1943 he went to Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee, where he served as head librarian for more than two decades.
