Christchurch, city, Canterbury regional council, eastern South Island, New Zealand, on the Avon River. It was the last and most successful colonizing project inspired by Edward Gibbon Wakefield and his New Zealand Company.
Christchurch was founded by the Canterbury Association, which was formed in 1848 largely through the efforts of John Robert Godley and planned to establish a model Church of England settlement. The original immigrants arrived on five ships in 1850â€“51. Their settlement, known as Canterbury, was renamed for Christ Church, Oxford, the college Godley had attended. Proclaimed a city in 1862 and made a borough in 1868, Christchurch was expanded in 1903, and it is now the most populous city on South Island and the second largest city (after Auckland) in New Zealand.
