Georges de Porto-Riche,  (born May 20, 1849, Bordeaux, Fr.—died  Sept. 5, 1930, Paris) French playwright who began as a writer of historical dramas but made his most original contribution with psychological plays produced at the new realistic Théâtre-Libre of André Antoine in the 1890s.
Porto-Riche came to public notice when La Chance de Françoise became the first of his plays to be produced at the Théâtre-Libre, in 1888. His subsequent works were acute psychological studies of what he considered to be the inevitable conflict between the sexes. His theme was sensual love, which he studied mainly in the maladjusted married couple. This is the subject of his best plays, Amoureuse (1891), Le Passé (1897), and Le Vieil Homme (1911), all of which examine the eternal triangle of the wife, the husband, and the lover. The so-called théâtre d’amour that Porto-Riche innovated was highly influential and was much imitated for some years. He was elected to the Académie Française in 1923.
