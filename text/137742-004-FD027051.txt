After receiving the Itararé, it forms part of the São Paulo–Paraná estado (state) border. There are numerous rapids along its course, which is navigable only for the last 50 mi.

Tributaries include the Rio das Cinzas and Rio Tibagi, the latter having an important hydroelectric station near Monte Alegre.
