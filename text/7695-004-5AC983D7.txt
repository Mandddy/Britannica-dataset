Caterpillar, larva of a butterfly or moth (Lepidoptera). Most caterpillars have cylindrical bodies consisting of multiple segments, with three pairs of true legs on the thorax and several pairs of short, fleshy prolegs on the abdomen. The head has six small eyes (stemmata) on each side that function in light detection but not in image formation. They have short segmented antennae and strong jaws. Many caterpillars within the order Lepidoptera are called worms, such as the measuring worm, silkworm, and armyworm.
Caterpillars are known for their voracious appetites. They generally eat leaves of various types of plants, though some species eat insects or other small animals. Leaf-eating species can cause extensive damage to fruit trees, crops, ornamental plants, hardwood trees, and shrubs. For example, caterpillars of the cabbage looper moth (Trichoplusia ni) can consume three times their body weight in leaf matter daily. In addition to the damage these caterpillars cause by eating the leaves of cabbages and allied crops, the fecal matter they produce, known as frass, can stain leaves and render the plants unsaleable. Examples of insect-eating caterpillars include those of harvester butterflies (Feniseca tarquinius), which prey on woolly aphids, and the butterfly Alesa amesis, which feeds on the nymphs of insects in the order Homoptera. The snail-eating Hyposmocoma molluscivora is the only lepidopteran known to feed on a type of gastropod.
