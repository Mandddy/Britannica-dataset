Samuel Rogers,  (born July 30, 1763, Stoke Newington, near London—died  Dec. 18, 1855, London) English poet, best remembered as a witty conversationalist and as a friend of greater poets.
Rogers attained eminence with the publication of his popular discursive poem The Pleasures of Memory (1792). On his father’s death (1793) he inherited a banking firm, and for the next half century he maintained an influential position as a leading figure in London society and as a generous host to brilliant company. His acquisition of paintings and objets d’art made his home a centre for anyone ambitious to be thought a man of taste. The amusing, though often unkind, conversations held at his breakfast and dinner parties were recorded by Alexander Dyce and published as Recollections of the Table-Talk of Samuel Rogers (1856; edited by Morchard Bishop, 1952). In spite of his sharp tongue, he performed many kind offices for his friends. He aided Richard Sheridan in his dying days and helped to secure a pension for Henry Cary, translator of Dante. He secured a position for William Wordsworth as distributor of stamps for Westmorland. He also continued to write poetry, including an epic, The Voyage of Columbus (1810); a collection of verse tales, Italy (1822–28); and a miscellaneous collection titled Poems (1834). In his own lifetime, his poetry was widely admired. On Wordsworth’s death, in 1850, Rogers was offered the laureateship, which he refused.
