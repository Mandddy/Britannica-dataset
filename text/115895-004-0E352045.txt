Christian, baron von Wolff, Wolff also spelled Wolf   (born January 24, 1679, Breslau, Silesia [now Wrocław, Poland]—died April 9, 1754, Halle, Prussia [Germany]) philosopher, mathematician, and scientist who worked in many subjects but who is best known as the German spokesman of the Enlightenment.
Wolff was educated at the universities of Breslau, Jena, and Leipzig and was a pupil of the philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. On the recommendation of Leibniz he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Halle in 1707, but he was banished in 1723 as a result of theological disputes with Pietists, who were followers of the German movement for an increase of piety in Lutheran churches. He became professor of mathematics and philosophy at the University of Marburg, Hesse (1723–40), and, as science adviser to Peter the Great (1716–25), he helped found the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in Russia. After returning to the University of Halle, at the request of the king of Prussia, Frederick II the Great, he became chancellor (1741–54).
