William Whiston,  (born Dec. 9, 1667, Norton, Leicestershire, Eng.—died Aug. 22, 1752, Lyndon, Rutland) Anglican priest and mathematician who sought to harmonize religion and science, and who is remembered for reviving in England the heretical views of Arianism.
Ordained in 1693, Whiston served from 1694 to 1698 as chaplain to John Moore, Anglican bishop of Norwich. During this period he wrote A New Theory of the Earth (1696), in which he claimed that the biblical stories of the creation, flood, and final conflagration could be explained scientifically as accounts of events with historical bases. After three years as vicar of Lowestoft (1698–1701), he returned to Cambridge, his alma mater, as assistant to the mathematician Isaac Newton, whom he succeeded as professor in 1703.
