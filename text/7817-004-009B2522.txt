Jacob Dolson Cox,  (born Oct. 27, 1828, Montreal, Que., Can.—died  Aug. 8, 1900, Magnolia, Mass., U.S.) U.S. political leader who became one of the great “civilian” Union generals during the American Civil War and one of the country’s foremost military historians.
After dipping into the fields of theology and education, Cox was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1853 and served in the state senate (1859–61). Appointed by the governor as one of three generals of militia (1860), he studied tactics, strategy, and military history. He subsequently raised troops for the Union and was commissioned brigadier general, U.S. volunteers. Cox took part in the West Virginia campaign (1861), and he was in supreme command of the Kanawha region from spring to August 1862. His troops were then ordered to Virginia to join General Ambrose E. Burnside’s IX Corps, which he commanded during the Battle of Antietam (September). In April–December 1863 he headed the Department of Ohio, and he also participated in the Atlanta campaign (1864).
