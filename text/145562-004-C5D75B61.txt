Sealab, experimental program sponsored by the U.S. Navy intended to determine whether humans could live and work successfully for long periods of time at the bottom of the ocean. The name of the program also refers to any of the three experimental underwater habitats deployed in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans between 1964 and 1969 as part of the program. Elaborate underwater dwellings called habitats were placed on the ocean floor at depths up to 180 metres (600 feet) in which divers, called aquanauts, lived under the pressures existing at these depths for various lengths of time, often leaving the habitat for several hours to work on the ocean floor. The program was terminated in 1969 after the death of a diver from carbon monoxide asphyxiation during a mission to repair a leak in one of the helium tanks.
