Joseph Furphy, pseudonym Tom Collins   (born Sept. 26, 1843, Yering, near Yarra Glen, Vic., Australia—died  Sept. 13, 1912, Claremont, W. Aus., Australia) Australian author whose novels combine an acute sense of local Australian life and colour with the eclectic philosophy and literary ideas of a self-taught workingman.
The son of Irish immigrants, Furphy worked as a thresher, teamster, and gold miner before settling down in 1884 at his brothers’ foundry at Shepparton. There he wrote a picaresque novel, Such Is Life (1903), written as excerpts from the diary of Tom Collins. Furphy’s other major works, Rigby’s Romance (serialized 1905; published in book form, 1921) and The Buln Buln and the Brolga (published posthumously in 1948), were written from chapters cut from the original of Such Is Life. His Poems were published in 1916.
