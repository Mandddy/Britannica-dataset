Eta Carinae, also called Homunculus Nebula,  peculiar red star and nebula about 7,500 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Carina and now known to be a binary star system. It is one of a small class of stars called luminous blue variables. The English astronomer Sir Edmond Halley noted it in 1677 as a star of about fourth magnitude. In 1838 Sir John Herschel observed it as a first-magnitude star. By 1843 it had reached its greatest recorded brightness, approximately âˆ’1 magnitude, or as bright as the brightest stars. Unlike the common types of exploding stars called novae and supernovae, it remained bright for several years. From about 1857 it faded steadily, disappearing to the unaided eye only about 1870. Since then it has varied irregularly about the seventh magnitude. The nebula around the star was formed during its 19th-century brightening and is an expanding shell of gas and dust, shaped like an hourglass with a disk at its centre.
In 2005 astronomers studying far-ultraviolet spectral observations of Eta Carinae made by spacecraft found that it is a binary star system with an orbital period of 5.54 years. Its A component has a temperature of about 15,000 K; its B component, about 35,000 K. The main star in Eta Carinae is about 100 times more massive than the Sun and is expected to become a supernova in the next several thousand years.
