José Maria de Eça de Queirós, shared pseudonym Carlos Fradique Mendes  (born November 25, 1845, Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal—died August 16, 1900, Paris, France) novelist committed to social reform who introduced naturalism and realism to Portugal. He is considered to be one of the greatest Portuguese novelists and is certainly the leading 19th-century Portuguese novelist. His works have been translated into many languages.
Eça de Queirós was the illegitimate son of a prominent magistrate. He received a degree in law in 1866 from the University of Coimbra and then settled in Lisbon. There his father helped the young man make a start in the legal profession. Eça de Queirós’s real interest lay in literature, however, and soon his short stories—ironic, fantastic, macabre, and often gratuitously shocking—and essays on a wide variety of subjects began to appear in the Gazeta de Portugal.
