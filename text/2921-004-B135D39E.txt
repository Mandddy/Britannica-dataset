Muskellunge,  (species Esox masquinongy), solitary and somewhat uncommon pike valued as a fighting game fish and, to a lesser extent, as a food fish. It inhabits weedy rivers and lakes of the North American Great Lakes region. Largest of the pike family (Esocidae) the muskellunge averages about 9 kg (20 pounds) in weight but may be 1.8 m (6 feet) long and weigh 36 kg (80 pounds) or more. It is recognized by the elongate body and by the absence of scales on the lower part of the cheeks and gill covers. See also pike.
