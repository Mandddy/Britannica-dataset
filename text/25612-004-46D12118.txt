Diego Portales , in full Diego José Víctor Portales  (born June 26, 1793, Santiago, Viceroyalty of Peru [now in Chile]—died June 6, 1837, Valparaíso, Chile) Chilean politician and for seven years virtual dictator who was instrumental in establishing political order and instituting economic progress in Chile. Disliked by some Chileans during his lifetime, he became a symbol of Chilean unity after his death.
Born into a middle-class family, Portales amassed a small fortune early in life. In 1824 he was awarded a monopoly on tobacco, tea, and liquors that proved immensely profitable but aroused the anger of the Chilean landowners. Upon termination of the monopoly after a few years, Portales founded two newspapers to expound his authoritarian doctrines. When the Conservative Party entered office in 1830, he was, as chief minister, the real power in the land. Disdainful of political freedoms, he imprisoned his pipiolo (liberal) opponents, silenced the opposition press, and subdued the army. Portales ruled through the constitution of 1833, a document that created a centralized state dominated by the conservative oligarchy. Liberals and military leaders were barred from participation in the government.
