Sea pen, any of the 300 species of the order Pennatulacea, colonial invertebrate marine animals of the class Anthozoa (phylum Cnidaria). The name sea pen derives from their resemblance to quill pens. They occur in shallow and deep waters from polar seas to the tropics.
The central stalk of the animal consists of a lower part, the peduncle, which anchors the colony in mud or sand, and an upper part, the rachis, which bears polyps (hollow stalks with a mouth and tentacles at the free end) or branches bearing several polyps. The central stalk is known as the primary, or axial, polyp. Those branching from it are the secondary polyps. Colonies of some genera—e.g., Chunella—bear few polyps. Others bear as many as 35,000. The mouth and tentacles of the primary polyp are degenerate, consisting of little more than a fleshy stem strengthened by a central horny rod.
