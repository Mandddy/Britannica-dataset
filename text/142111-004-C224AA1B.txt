Fernández was sent to the Castilian court at the age of 13 and distinguished himself in the fighting following Isabella I’s accession (1474), and he played an increasingly important role in the war against the Muslim kingdom of Granada. He was one of the two commissioners who conducted the final negotiations for the surrender of Granada (1492).
