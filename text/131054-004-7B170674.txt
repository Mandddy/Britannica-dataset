Monarch, also called monarch flycatcher,  any of nearly 100 bird species constituting the family Monarchidae. The term monarch is usually reserved for members of the Australian and Asian genera Monarcha and Hypothymis; the members of the approximately 16 other Asian and African genera of monarchids are called flycatchers, with various modifiers.
In all monarchids the bill is markedly broad-based and flat, and the feet are quite small. Males of some species are strikingly coloured. Found from Africa through Southeast Asia to northern China and Melanesia, monarchids live chiefly in warm forest, where they feed on insects, more often gleaned from foliage than taken in the air.
