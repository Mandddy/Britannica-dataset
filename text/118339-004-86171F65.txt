Hydrofoil,  underwater fin with a flat or curved winglike surface that is designed to lift a moving boat or ship by means of the reaction upon its surface from the water through which it moves. Ships that use hydrofoils, or foils, are themselves called hydrofoils. Hydrofoils can lift a boat’s hull clear of the water as speed increases, and the resultant reduction in drag yields higher speeds without expending more horsepower.
The two main foil systems now in use are the surface-piercing and submerged types. Surface-piercing foils just break the surface of the water and are usually arranged in a V-shape. Foils that stay fully submerged project down into the water vertically. When at rest or steaming slowly, a hydrofoil ship supports its weight by its own buoyance, but as speed is increased, the foils carry progressively more weight until the ship’s hull is raised clear of the water. Hydrofoil ships are faster than ships of conventional design but are limited to moderate sizes.
