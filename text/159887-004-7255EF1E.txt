Cutlass fish, any of several species of fishes in the family Trichiuridae (order Perciformes). All species are marine; representatives occur in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Cutlass fishes have a distinctive appearance with a long eel-like body and a low dorsal fin that extends the length of the back. The tail is greatly reduced in size. The tail is forked in some forms and tapers to a point in others. They are carnivorous, feeding primarily on other fishes, and have enlarged mouths and sharp, pointed teeth. One species (Trichiurus lepturus) attains a maximum length of 1.5 metres (5 feet). The family consists of 10 genera and about 45 species.
