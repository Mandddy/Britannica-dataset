Giovanni Battista Belzoni,  (born Nov. 5, 1778, Padua, Republic of Venice—died  Dec. 3, 1823, Gwato, Benin) excavator of Egyptian archaeological sites.
Originally planning to join a religious order, Belzoni went to England in 1803 where he turned his powerful six-foot seven-inch physique to earning a living as a circus strong man. He also exhibited models of hydraulic engines and in 1815 he went to Cairo to offer to Muḥammad ʿAlī Pasha, the founder of modern Egypt, hydraulic engines for use in irrigation. Two years later he had embarked on a new career, excavating Egyptian tombs and temples for their treasures with scant regard for incidental damage to less desirable items. Many of his archaeological feats might today be regarded as pillage.
