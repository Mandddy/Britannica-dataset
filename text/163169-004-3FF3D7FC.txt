Martin Agricola, original name Martin Sore, Sore also spelled Sohr  (born Jan. 6, 1486, Schwiebus, Silesia [now in Poland]—died  June 10, 1556, Magdeburg, Archbishopric of Magdeburg [Germany]) composer, teacher, and writer on music, one of the first musicians to concern himself with the needs of the Reformed churches and to publish musical treatises in the vernacular.
Agricola was self-taught, called to music “from the plough,” as his chosen surname suggests. He worked at Magdeburg from roughly 1519 and by 1527 became choirmaster at the first Protestant school there, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He published several treatises on music theory, most notably his Musica instrumentalis deudsch (1529). Much of the German musical vocabulary that he invented is still in use. His books give a valuable picture of the musical life of his time, particularly his descriptions of early 16th-century musical instruments. His printed volumes include sacred music and many instrumental pieces that are transcriptions of vocal part-songs. Unfortunately, most of his unpublished compositions are lost.
