Adam Jerzy, Prince Czartoryski,  (born January 14, 1770, Warsaw, Pol.—died July 15, 1861, Montfermeil, France) Polish statesman who worked unceasingly for the restoration of Poland when Russia, Prussia, and Austria had partitioned his country’s former lands among themselves.
Czartoryski was the most renowned member of a princely family, descended from the Lithuanian royal house, which wielded great power in Poland in the 18th century. He received a thorough education in his native country and traveled widely in western Europe. On returning to Poland in 1791, he played a distinguished part in the anti-Russian 1792 campaign that precipitated the second partition of Poland (1793). Although neither he nor his father took an active part in the 1794 insurrection that resulted in the third partition of Poland (1795), their palace at Puławy was destroyed and the family estates confiscated.
