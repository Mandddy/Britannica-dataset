Mademoiselle Rachel, original name Élisa Félix   (born Feb. 28, 1820/21, Mumpf, Switz.—died  Jan. 3, 1858, Le Cannet, France) French classical tragedienne who dominated the Comédie-Française for 17 years.
Mlle Rachel sang on the streets of Lyon and Paris, where her acting ability was quickly discovered by Isidore Samson, who taught her the acting techniques that he had learned from François-Joseph Talma. Mlle Rachel studied classical statuary for posture, practiced vocal intonations and gestures, performed in many academy plays, and at 17 made her debut at the Comédie-Française as Camille in Pierre Corneille’s Horace. Press and public at once acclaimed the new star, who, although thin and less than 5 feet (150 cm) tall, dominated the stage with her regal bearing, fiery glances, and intense concentration.
