Johann Nestroy, in full Johann Nepomuk Eduard Ambrosius Nestroy   (born Dec. 7, 1801, Vienna, Austria—died  May 25, 1862, Graz) one of Austria’s greatest comic dramatists, and a brilliant character actor who dominated the mid-19th-century Viennese popular stage.
After a career as an opera singer (1822–31) in several European cities, Nestroy returned to Vienna and began writing and acting. His 50 plays, which are virtually all adaptations of plots from earlier plays or novels, characteristically revolve around a brilliant, detached central character (played by Nestroy himself ) whose part requires a virtuoso performance in language, diction, and timing in order to convey its sharp nuances. Nestroy made use of satire, irony, and parody to dissect the newly rich bourgeoisie, as well as a number of the leading figures of Viennese society. From 1854 until he retired in 1860 he managed the Carl-Theater in Vienna.
