Manicouagan River, also spelled Manikuagan River, French Rivière Manicouagan,  river in the Côte-Nord (North Shore) region, eastern Quebec province, Canada. Rising near the Labrador border, the river drains lakes Muskalagan and Manicouagan southward into the mouth of the St. Lawrence River near Baie-Comeau and Hauterive. It is more than 340 miles (550 km) long from the source of its longest headstream. The Manicouagan drains more than 16,000 square miles (41,000 square km) of the heavily forested region, hence its Indian name meaning “where there is bark.” Long an important lumbering artery supporting the huge pulp and paper factories at Baie-Comeau, the river has become a major source of hydroelectric power; Hydro-Quebec has built several plants—including Daniel-Johnson Dam, one of the world’s largest multiarch dams—which together have a generating capacity in the millions of kilowatts. A submarine cable, laid in 1954, carries electric power under the St. Lawrence to the copper-mining regions in the Gaspé Peninsula. Iron ore is mined in the upper Manicouagan Valley.
