E. Kirby-Smith, in full Edmund Kirby-smith   (born May 16, 1824, St. Augustine, Fla., U.S.—died  March 28, 1893, Sewanee, Tenn.) Confederate general during the American Civil War (1861–65) who controlled the area west of the Mississippi River for the Confederacy for almost two years after it had been severed from the rest of the South.
Born Edmund Kirby Smith, he later signed his name E. Kirby Smith; the hyphenated form of the name was adopted by his family after his death. Graduated from the U.S. Military Academy, West Point, N.Y., in 1845, Kirby-Smith fought in the Mexican War (1846–48) and in Indian warfare on the frontier before he reached the rank of major in 1860. When Florida seceded from the Union (January 1861), he entered the Confederate Army and was made a brigadier general in June. Commanding a brigade at the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas; July 1861), he was seriously wounded. In 1862 he led the advance in the Kentucky campaign, defeated the Union forces at Richmond, Ky., and fought at Perryville, Ky., and Stones River (Murfreesboro) in Tennessee. He was promoted to lieutenant general in October and the following February was given command of the Trans-Mississippi Department.
