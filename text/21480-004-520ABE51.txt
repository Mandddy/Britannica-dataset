Dorothy Thompson,  (born July 9, 1893, Lancaster, N.Y., U.S.—died Jan. 30, 1961, Lisbon, Port.) American newspaperwoman and writer, one of the most famous journalists of the 20th century.
The daughter of a Methodist minister, Thompson attended the Lewis Institute in Chicago and Syracuse University in New York (A.B., 1914), where she became ardently committed to woman suffrage. After World War I she went to Europe as a freelance correspondent and became famous for an exclusive interview with Empress Zita of Austria after Emperor Charles’s unsuccessful attempt in 1921 to regain his throne. In 1925 she became head of the Berlin bureau of the New York Evening Post and met the novelist Sinclair Lewis. She married him in London in 1928 (her second of three marriages). On their return to America, Thompson led a domestic life for a few years but, back in Europe, she began reporting about the Nazi movement, infuriating Adolf Hitler so much that, by his own personal order in 1934, she became the first American correspondent to be expelled from Germany. In 1936, for the New York Herald Tribune, she began her newspaper column “On the Record,” which became hugely popular and eventually was syndicated to as many as 170 daily papers (1941–58). On network radio and in popular speeches, she warned against Hitler, and Time magazine rated her the country’s second most popular woman (after Eleanor Roosevelt).
