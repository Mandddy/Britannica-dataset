North American monsoon, a seasonal reversal of wind affecting Central America. It is characterized by winds that blow northerly off the Pacific Ocean during warmer months and southerly from the land during cooler months of the year. Although the Gulf Coast of the United States is prone to weather patterns with monsoonal tendencies, consistent winds characteristic of true monsoons are not established there.
In Central America a true monsoonal cycle occurs over a small area facing the Pacific Ocean between 5° and 12° N. Not only is there a complete seasonal reversal of the wind, but the rainfall regime is typically monsoonal. The winter period, from November to January and from March to April according to latitude and other factors, is very dry. The rainy season begins earlier (May) in the south and progressively later farther north, coming at the end of June in southern Mexico. It concludes at the end of September in the north and as late as early November in the south. The result is a rainy season that increases in duration with decreasing latitude; it lasts three months in southern Mexico and from six to seven months in Costa Rica. Latitude for latitude, this is a subdued replica of the Indian monsoon.
