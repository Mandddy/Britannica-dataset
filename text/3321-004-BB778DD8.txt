Paddle wheel,  method of ship propulsion that was once widely employed but is now almost entirely superseded by the screw propeller. Early experiments with steam-driven paddles acting as oars led several inventors, including Robert Fulton, to mount the paddles in a wheel form, either at the stern or at the sides of the vessel.
The device is highly efficient and is competitive even with modern propellers; it was supplanted by the latter because of the paddle wheelâ€™s vulnerability to damage in storms and its emergence from the water when the ship rolled heavily, which made steering difficult. For inland navigation these defects were insignificant, and paddle-wheel steamers long continued to operate on many rivers.
