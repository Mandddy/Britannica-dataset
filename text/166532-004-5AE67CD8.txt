Alain Chartier,  (born c. 1385, Bayeux, Normandy, Franceâ€”died c. 1433, Avignon, Provence?) French poet and political writer whose didactic, elegant, and Latinate style was regarded as a model by succeeding generations of poets and prose writers.
Educated at the University of Paris, Chartier entered the royal service, acting as secretary and notary to both Charles VI and the dauphin, later Charles VII. He carried out various diplomatic missions for Charles VII, and in 1428 he was sent to Scotland to negotiate the marriage of Margaret of Scotland with the future Louis XI.
