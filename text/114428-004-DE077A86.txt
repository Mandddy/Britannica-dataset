Bamiyan, also spelled Bāmīān or Bāmyān,  town located in central Afghanistan. It lies about 80 miles (130 km) northwest of Kabul, the country’s capital, in the Bamiyan valley, at an elevation of 8,495 feet (2,590 metres).
Bamiyan is first mentioned in 5th-century-ce Chinese sources and was visited by the Chinese Buddhist monks and travelers Faxian (c. 400 ce) and Xuanzang (630); it was by that time a centre of commerce and of Buddhism. Two enormous figures of the Buddha were created there in the 4th and 5th centuries; the larger was 175 feet (53 metres) high, and the smaller was 120 feet (about 40 metres). The statues were carved from the living rock and were once finished with fine plaster and painted. When Xuanzang saw the figures, they were also decorated with gold and fine jewels. The two Buddha figures, together with numerous ancient man-made caves in the cliffs north of the town, made Bamiyan a major Afghan archaeological site. However, in early 2001 the country’s then-ruling Taliban regime had the statues destroyed, despite worldwide pleas to save them. During the subsequent search for a colossal reclining Buddha—also reported by Xuanzang and thought to be some 980 feet (300 metres) long—in 2008 an additional Buddha was discovered nearby. The 3rd-century statue, which was badly damaged, represented the Buddha in a sleeping position and measured 62 feet (19 metres) in length.
