Greyhound, also spelled grayhound ,  fastest of dogs, one of the oldest of breeds, and long symbolic of the aristocracy. Its likeness appears on an Egyptian tomb dating from about 3000 bc. Streamlined and slender but strong, the greyhound can attain a speed of about 45 miles (72 km) per hour. It has a narrow head, long neck, deep chest, long, muscular hindquarters, and a long, slim tail. Its coat is short and smooth and of various colours. The greyhound stands 25 to 27 inches (64 to 69 cm) and weighs 60 to 70 pounds (27 to 32 kg). It hunts by sight and is used mainly to pursue hares, but it can also hunt deer, foxes, and small game. Greyhounds are also raced for sport, chasing a mechanical rabbit.
The Italian greyhound is a breed of toy dog apparently derived from the greyhound. It has existed in its present form for more than 2,000 years and has been a favourite of the aristocracy. A miniature version of the greyhound, it stands 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm) and weighs 7 to 10 pounds (3 to 4.5 kg). It has large eyes and a thin, glossy coat that may be red-brown, fawn- or cream-coloured, white, blue-gray, or gray. The Italian greyhound is usually an active, gentle dog.
