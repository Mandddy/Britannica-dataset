Blimp,  nonrigid or semirigid airship dependent on internal gas pressure to maintain its form. The origin of the name blimp is uncertain, but the most common explanation is that it derives from “British Class B airship” plus “limp”—i.e., nonrigid. Blimps were used by navies during World War I in convoy and antisubmarine patrol duty, became attractions at fairs and expositions, and later carried advertising messages.
The U.S. Navy’s ZPG-3W airship—403 feet (123 metres) long, 85 feet in diameter, with a capacity of more than 1,500,000 cubic feet (42,450 cubic metres)—was the world’s largest nonrigid blimp. Four of them were commissioned in 1958. One exploded and crashed two years later, and the Navy retired the others by 1962.
