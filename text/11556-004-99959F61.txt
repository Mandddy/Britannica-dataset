Erik Gustaf Geijer,  (born Jan. 12, 1783, Ransäter, Värmland, Sweden—died  April 23, 1847, Stockholm) Swedish poet, historian, philosopher, and social and political theorist who was a leading advocate, successively, of the conservative and liberal points of view.
A trip to England directly after his university days made a great impression on Geijer and gave him political insight into the life of a major European power. A collection of his diaries and letters was published as Geijer i England (1814; Impressions of England). The defeat that Sweden suffered in 1809 through the loss of Finland to Russia led him to a rather extreme nationalism. He was one of the founders, in 1811, of the Götiska Förbundet (“Gothic Society”), which aimed at furthering national feeling through historical study. In 1817 Geijer became professor of history at Uppsala University where he was in close contact with the New Romantic Group, which briefly led him into a political conservatism. His main historical works are Svea rikes räfder (1825; “The Annals of the Kingdom of Sweden”) and Svenska folkets historia, 3 vol. (1832–36; The History of the Swedes). Geijer’s historical investigations, however, rather than furthering his conservatism, brought him to radically new political ideas: universal suffrage, equal educational opportunities for all, and elimination of poverty.
