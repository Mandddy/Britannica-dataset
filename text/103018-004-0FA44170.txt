River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland, rising in northwestern County Cavan and flowing for about 161 miles (259 km) in a southerly direction to enter the Atlantic Ocean via a 70-mile (113-kilometre) estuary below Limerick city. It drains an area of 6,060 square miles (15,695 square km). As the main river draining the central lowland of Ireland, it is surrounded by marshes and bogs for much of its course and widens at various points into lakes, many with islands.
The source of the Shannon is generally considered to be the pools at the foot of Tiltinbane Mountain. After a few miles it enters Lough Allen and then flows south through a wide belt of marshes and water meadows. It is crossed by a bridge at Leitrim and at Carrick-on-Shannon, above which it is joined by the Boyle from the west. From north of Carrick south to Roosky, it flows through a landscape dominated by hills of glacial drift (drumlins) interspersed with bogs and marshes. Near Termonbarry, at Richmond Harbour, the river is joined by the Royal Canal; and at Lanesborough it enters Lough Ree.
