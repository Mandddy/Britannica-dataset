Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla), evergreen timber and ornamental conifer of the family Araucariaceae, native to Norfolk Island, situated in the South Pacific Ocean between New Caledonia and New Zealand. The wood of large trees is used in construction, furniture, and shipbuilding. The plant is grown as an outdoor ornamental in regions with a Mediterranean climate, and the attractive saplings are cultivated throughout the world as houseplants. The Norfolk Island pine was discovered on the second expedition of Capt. James Cook (1772â€“75) and was introduced to cultivation shortly thereafter. Despite its common name, the plant is not a true pine.
In nature the Norfolk Island pine can grow to a height of 60 metres (200 feet), with a trunk sometimes reaching 3 metres (10 feet) in diameter. The branches are arranged in symmetric whorls, and the trunks are characteristically straight. The leaves of young plants are needlelike and curve upward to a point, while those of mature trees are scalelike and densely overlapping. The round female cones are spiny and reach up to 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter. An unusual feature of this species is that lateral branches cut from a tree and rooted in soil continue to grow horizontally and never produce an erect stem.
