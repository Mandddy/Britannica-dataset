Mount Osutaka airline disaster, crash of a Japan Air Lines (JAL) passenger jet on Aug. 12, 1985, in southern Gumma prefecture, Japan, northwest of Tokyo, that killed 520 people. The incident is one of the deadliest single-plane crashes in history.
Domestic flight JAL 123 departed Tokyo’s Haneda airport at 6:12 pm and was scheduled to land in Ōsaka one hour later. The Boeing 747 was completely booked; it was the eve of the Japanese holiday Bon, and many people were going home to see relatives or going on vacation. The plane had left Tokyo airspace and had ascended to 24,000 feet (7,300 metres) when the first distress calls came from the plane’s pilot, who initially reported losing altitude and then reported difficulty controlling the plane. The plane fell to around 10,000 feet (3,000 metres). The pilot continued to send distress calls and asked to be rerouted to the Tokyo airport. But about 45 minutes after takeoff, the plane crashed into Mount Takamagahara near Mount Osutaka (the latter mountain was the first reported crash site and became the popular name for the crash) in the Kantō Range.
