Fibroblast, the principal active cells of connective tissue. Fibroblasts are large, flat, elongated (spindle-shaped) cells possessing processes extending out from the ends of the cell body. The cell nucleus is flat and oval. Fibroblasts produce tropocollagen, which is the forerunner of collagen, and ground substance, an amorphous gel-like matrix that fills the spaces between cells and fibres in connective tissue.
Fibroblasts appear to play an important role in wound healing, and this activity is thought to be regulated by cells known as fibrocytes residing in the tissue stroma. Following tissue injury, fibroblasts migrate to the site of damage, where they deposit new collagen and facilitate the healing process.
