Chutney,  relish that accompanies an Indian meal. Chutneys may be highly spiced or bland and may be prepared from fruits, vegetables, or herbs. The commercially made chutneys of Great Britain, which have remained popular since the height of the Empire, are usually stewed from mangoes or other fruits, onions, raisins, sugar, and spices. Indian curry dishes are accompanied by one or more chutneys, and in the West chutneys are also eaten with cold meats.
