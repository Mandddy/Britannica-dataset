Saint Gerard, Hungarian Szent Gellért  (born c. 980, Venice [Italy]—died Aug. 29, 1046; feast day Sept. 24) Venetian Benedictine monk, one of the chief Christian evangelizers of Hungary. He was a scion of the Morosini family and served as bishop of Csanád in southern Hungary. In the struggle for the throne that followed the death of Stephen I, Gerard became a martyr.
In his youth Gerard studied at the Benedictine monastery at San Giorgio Maggiore near Venice. In 1015 he was chosen to be abbot of the monastery. He soon retired from this position, however, first to live in seclusion in Istria, then to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. During his travels he arrived in Hungary, where at the request of Stephen I he undertook the education of the king’s only son, the young prince Emeric (Imre). In 1030 the king appointed Gerard first bishop of Marosvár (Csanád), where Gerard founded a monastery, a cathedral, and a school for priests. Gerard converted many Hungarians to Christianity. It was probably in this period that Gerard wrote his Deliberatio supra hymnum trium puerorum (“Meditation on the Hymn of the Three Young Men”), the oldest surviving work of Hungarian theological literature.
