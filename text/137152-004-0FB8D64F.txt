Sava River, also spelled Save, German Sau, Hungarian Száva,  river in the western Balkans. Its basin, 36,960 square miles (95,720 square km) in area, covers much of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and northern Serbia. It rises in the Triglav group of the Julian Alps as two rivers, the Sava Bohinjka and the Sava Dolinka, which join at Radovljica. It then flows mainly east-southeastward through Slovenia, just north of Ljubljana, through Croatia touching Zagreb, and then forms the border between Croatia and Bosnia before entering Serbia and joining the Danube River at Belgrade after a course of 584 miles (940 km). The Sava River is navigable upstream to Sisak, 362 miles (583 km) from the Danube, for small freight vessels. Its tributaries are the Soča, Savinja, Krka, Kupa, Lonja, Una, Vrbas, Bosna, Drina, and Kolubara rivers. Major towns along the river are Kranj, Zagreb, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Bosanski Šamac, Sremska Mitrovica, and Šabac.
