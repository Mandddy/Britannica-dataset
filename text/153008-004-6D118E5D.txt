After graduating she began working in repertory theatres as an actress and stage manager. She was discovered by Peter Brook for his Theatre of Cruelty revue, in which her career was established. In 1964 she had a stunning personal triumph when she portrayed Charlotte Corday in the London production of The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat…, better known as Marat/Sade. She repeated this role in the New York production of Marat/Sade in 1965 and in the film version (1967) of the play.
