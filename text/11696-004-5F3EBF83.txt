Augustin-Jean Fresnel,  (born May 10, 1788, Broglie, France—died July 14, 1827, Ville-d’Avray) French physicist who pioneered in optics and did much to establish the wave theory of light advanced by English physicist Thomas Young.
Beginning in 1804 Fresnel served as an engineer building roads in various departments of France. He began his research in optics in 1814. He lost his post temporarily during the period following Napoleon’s return from Elba in 1815. At the beginning of the 19th century, the scientific community championed Isaac Newton’s corpuscular, or particle, theory of light. However, in 1802 Young showed that an interference pattern is produced when light from two sources overlaps, which could happen only if light was a wave. Fresnel initially did not know about Young’s experiment, but his experiments with various devices for producing interference fringes and diffraction convinced him that the wave theory of light was correct. As a starting point for his mathematical description of diffraction, Fresnel used Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens’s principle that every point on a wave front can be considered a secondary source of spherical wavelets.
