Yinchuan, Wade-Giles romanization Yin-ch’uan, conventional Yinchwan,  city and capital of the Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia, north-central China. It is located in northern Ningxia in the south-central section of the Helan Mountains (which define the western extent of the Ordos Desert), near the western end of the Great Wall of China. The city lies west of the upper course of the Huang He (Yellow River), where the river makes its great bend to flow north along the western edge of the Ordos Plateau.
Yinchuan originally was a county under the name of Lian in 119 bce; its name was changed to Huaiyuan in the 6th century ce. After the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907, it was occupied by Tangut tribespeople in the 10th century; they later established the Xi (Western) Xia dynasty (1038–1227), of which Yinchuan was the capital. After the destruction of the Xi Xia dynasty by the Mongols in 1227, Yinchuan came under the rule of the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty. Under the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, it was the seat of the prefecture of Ningxia. In 1929, when the province of Ningxia was formed from parts of Gansu and Inner Mongolia, it became the capital city. In 1954, when Ningxia province was abolished, the city was put in Gansu province; but, with the establishment of the Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia in 1958, Yinchuan once again became the capital.
