Norman Thomas,  (born Nov. 20, 1884, Marion, Ohio, U.S.—died  Dec. 19, 1968, Huntington, N.Y.) American socialist, social reformer, and frequent candidate for political office.
Following his graduation from Union Theological Seminary, New York City, about 1911, Thomas accepted the pastorate of the East Harlem Church and the chairmanship of the American Parish, a settlement house in one of the poorest sections of New York City. He became a pacifist and opposed U.S. participation in World War I. Then, in 1918 Thomas joined the Socialist Party, and, leaving his East Harlem posts the same year, was appointed secretary of the newly formed Fellowship of Reconciliation, an international pacifist organization. In 1921 he became associate editor of the influential liberal weekly The Nation, and the following year he was made executive codirector of the League for Industrial Democracy—a position he held for more than 10 years. He was also one of the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union.
