The Hutchinson Family, American singing group of the mid-19th century, significant figures in the development of native popular music tradition. In contrast to the prevailing sentimental and minstrel songs of the period, their music confronted social issues and embraced causes including woman suffrage, prohibition of alcohol, and opposition to slavery and to the Mexican-American War.
Born and raised in Milford, N.H., U.S., three brothers—Judson, who sang tenor (b. March 14, 1817—d. Jan. 10, 1859, Lynn, Mass.); John, a baritone who could sing falsetto (b. Jan. 4, 1821—d. Oct. 29, 1908, Lynn); Asa, who sang bass (b. March 14, 1823—d. Nov. 25, 1884, Hutchinson, Minn.)—and their youngest sister, Abby, a contralto (b. Aug. 29, 1829—d. Nov. 24, 1892, New York City), formed a quartet and began giving concerts in New England in 1841. Initially their repertoire was centred around conventional melodramatic songs, but the Hutchinsons’ contacts with Frederick Douglass and with the Washingtonian movement of reformed alcoholics led a fourth brother, Jesse, to invent original lyrics with abolitionist and temperance themes to familiar hymns and folk songs. The quartet sang at antislavery rallies, including a Boston rally that drew 20,000 people, as well as in concerts in the eastern and midwestern United States and spent much of 1845–46 touring the British Isles. Despite a decline in popularity after the departure of Abby in 1849, the trio of brothers continued to tour together, sometimes attracting controversy, even violence, until 1855.
