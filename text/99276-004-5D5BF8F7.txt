Neville Marriner, in full Sir Neville Marriner  (born April 15, 1924, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England—died October 2, 2016, London) British violinist, teacher, and conductor who had one of the most prolific recording relationships in classical music history with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, a London chamber ensemble that he founded (1958) and for which he served as the music director (1958–2011; life president from 2011 until his death).
Marriner graduated from the Royal College of Music in London in 1946 and went on to study with René Benedetti at the Paris Conservatory. He then taught violin at the Royal College of Music from 1949 to 1959. During his early career as a violinist, he played with a number of small ensembles, including the Jacobean Ensemble, where he performed with the early-music specialist Thurston Dart. Marriner also played in the London Philharmonia (1952–56) and the London Symphony Orchestra (1956–68).
