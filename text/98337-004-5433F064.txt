Robert Altman,  (born February 20, 1925, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.—died November 20, 2006, Los Angeles, California) unconventional and independent American motion-picture director, whose works emphasize character and atmosphere over plot in exploring themes of innocence, corruption, and survival. Perhaps his best-known film was his first and biggest commercial success, the antiwar comedy M*A*S*H (1970).
Altman, the son of a well-to-do insurance man, was a member of a prominent family in Kansas City, Missouri. From his junior year of high school through the beginning of his college education, he attended the Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri. In 1945 he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces, serving as a pilot until 1947. After a failed attempt as an entrepreneur and a sojourn in Los Angeles, Altman took a job with the Calvin Company in Kansas City, where he directed dozens of industrial films. In 1957 he shot The Delinquents, a drama about juvenile delinquency, in Kansas City with a cast that included Tom Laughlin (later the star of the 1970s cult film Billy Jack). Altman also codirected, with George W. George (son of cartoonist Rube Goldberg), the documentary The James Dean Story (1957). That film, released two years after the actor’s death, brought Altman to the attention of the television industry, in which he would work for years, directing episodes of Combat, Bonanza, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents, among many other programs.
