Gerard Butler, in full Gerard James Butler  (born November 13, 1969, Glasgow, Scotland) Scottish actor distinguished by his rugged masculinity and charm, who often appeared as larger-than-life literary and historical figures.
Butler grew up in Paisley, Scotland, where he acted with the Scottish Youth Theatre before earning a law degree at the University of Glasgow. After an unsatisfying stint at a law firm, he abandoned that career path for the stage and was soon cast in Shakespeare’s tragedy Coriolanus and in an adaptation of the 1996 film Trainspotting; in the latter he starred as the young heroin addict Mark Renton (played onscreen by Ewan McGregor). In 1997 Butler moved to film with a supporting role in Mrs. Brown, a historical drama about Queen Victoria (played by Judi Dench) and her relationship with a Scottish servant. He had a small part in the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and appeared in several British films in the next few years, notably in a 1999 adaptation of Russian playwright Anton Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard.
