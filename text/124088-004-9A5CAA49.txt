Wang Anshi, Wade-Giles romanization Wang An-shih, courtesy name (zi) Jiefu, literary name (hao) Banshan  (born 1021, Linchuan, Jiangxi province, China—died 1086, Jiangning [now Nanjing], Jiangsu province) Chinese poet and prose writer, best known as a governmental reformer who implemented his unconventional idealism through the “New Laws,” or “New Policies,” of 1069–76. The academic controversy sparked by his reforms continued for centuries.
Wang emerged from a rising new group of southern bureaucrats with a strong utilitarian bent, who challenged their more conservative, large-landholding colleagues from the north. At age 21 Wang earned his jinshi (“advanced scholar”) degree in the civil service examinations, and for nearly two decades he served ably as a local administrator in various posts in the south.
