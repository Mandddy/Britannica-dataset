Pachyrhinosaurus, genus of horned ceratopsid dinosaurs that roamed northwestern North America from 71 million to 67 million years ago, near the end of the Cretaceous Period. It is closely related to Styracosaurus and Centrosaurus and more distantly related to Triceratops. Like other ceratopsids, it possessed a prominent skull characterized by a narrow but massive beak and a bony frill. The Greek name Pachyrhinosaurus means “reptile with a thick nose.”
Pachyrhinosaurus was both large and quadrupedal. It grew to 6 metres (20 feet) in length and weighed about 1,800 kg (almost 2 tons). A herbivore, Pachyrhinosaurus used the batteries of teeth in its jaws to slice open and consume plants. Some of its horns grew in unicorn fashion between and slightly behind the eyes, whereas others decorated the top edge of the frill. Pachyrhinosaurus also sported thickened knobs of bone; the largest of these knobs covered the top of the nose. The function of these knobs, horns, and frill is unknown, but they may have been used for species recognition, competition between males, or defense against predators.
