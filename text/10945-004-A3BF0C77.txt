Theodore Edward Hook,  (born Sept. 22, 1788, London—died  Aug. 24, 1841, London) prolific English playwright and novelist, best remembered as a founder of the “silver-fork” school of novelists who, in the early 19th century, aimed to describe fashionable English society from the inside for those on the outside.
Hook was the son of the composer and organist James Hook (1746–1827), and, while a schoolboy at Harrow, he wrote the words for his father’s comic operas. After leaving Oxford, he wrote farces and melodramas, ran into debt, and became a favourite wit in Regency high society. In 1813 his friend the prince regent procured him the post of accountant general to Mauritius.
