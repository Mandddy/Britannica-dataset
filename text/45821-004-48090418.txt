Tamara Platonovna Karsavina,  (born March 9/10, 1885, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  May 26, 1978, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, Eng.) Anglo-Russian ballerina whose partnership with Vaslav Nijinsky in Michel Fokine’s avant-garde ballets helped to revive interest in ballet in western Europe.
The daughter of a famous dancer, Platon Karsavin, she was educated at the Imperial Ballet School, St. Petersburg, under such teachers as Cecchetti, Christian Johansson, and Paul Gerdt, graduating in 1902. As ballerina at the Mariinsky Theatre she included in her repertoire Giselle and Odette-Odile in Swan Lake. Karsavina is best known as the leading ballerina of Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes from its beginning in 1909 until 1922. Between 1909 and 1914 (paired with Nijinsky until 1913) she created the majority of famous roles in Fokine’s Neoromantic repertoire, including Les Sylphides, Le Spectre de la Rose, Carnaval, Firebird, Petrushka, and Thamar. She also created leading roles in Léonide Massine’s The Three-Cornered Hat and Pulcinella. She came out of semiretirement in the early 1930s to revive some of her more famous roles for the Ballet Rambert and to create new ones for Frederick Ashton.
