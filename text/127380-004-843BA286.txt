Abdullah II, in full ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ḥusayn  (born January 30, 1962, Amman, Jordan) king of Jordan from 1999 and a member of the Hāshimite dynasty, considered by pious Muslims to be direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad (see Ahl al-Bayt).
Abdullah, the eldest son of King Ḥussein, served as the crown prince until age three, when unrest in the Middle East prompted Ḥussein to name Abdullah’s adult uncle, Prince Ḥassan, heir to the throne. Abdullah was educated in Great Britain and the United States, and in 1980 he graduated from the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, England. He later served in the British armed forces as well as in Jordan’s armed forces. In 1993 he was appointed deputy commander of the country’s elite Special Forces. He became commander of the Special Forces in 1994 and held that post until assuming the throne. Abdullah married a Palestinian, Rania al-Yasin, in 1993.
