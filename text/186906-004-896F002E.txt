Edward Kienholz,  (born October 23, 1927, Fairfield, Washington, U.S.â€”died June 10, 1994, Hope, Idaho) American self-taught sculptor known for his elaborate found-object assemblages, which convey a harsh scrutiny of American society.
Kienholz grew up in a working-class family on a farm in Washington state and learned auto repair, carpentry, and metalwork skills that served his art well later in life. He briefly attended Eastern Washington College of Education (now Eastern Washington University) in Cheney, Washington, and Whitworth College in Spokane, but he did not earn a degree. He did not study art in school, but he pursued painting on his own until he moved to Los Angeles in 1953 and began producing large wooden reliefs composed of found objects and industrial paints (procured from auto shops and the like). While living in Los Angeles, Kienholz opened two galleries, first the Now Gallery (opened 1956), which he closed in 1957 to partner that year with artist Walter Hopps in opening the Ferus Gallery, which became a successful space for avant-garde exhibitions through 1966.
