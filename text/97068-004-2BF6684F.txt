George Clooney, in full George Timothy Clooney  (born May 6, 1961, Lexington, Kentucky, U.S.) American actor and filmmaker who emerged in the 1990s as a popular leading man, known for his good looks and versatility, and who later became a respected director and screenwriter.
Although his family had a show-business background—his father, Nick Clooney, was a broadcast journalist, and Rosemary Clooney, his aunt, was a famous singer and actress—Clooney initially wanted to be a baseball player. After an unsuccessful tryout with the Cincinnati Reds, he moved to Los Angeles at age 21 to pursue an acting career. Two years later he began appearing in television sitcoms. Although Clooney soon had recurring roles on the popular series The Facts of Life and Roseanne, most of his early television work was forgettable. In 1994, however, he earned his big break when he was cast as Dr. Doug Ross on the drama ER.
