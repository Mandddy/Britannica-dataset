Essex, county, northeastern New York state, U.S. It comprises a mountainous region bounded by the Ausable River to the northeast, Vermont to the east (Lake Champlain constituting the border), Lake George to the southeast, and the Hudson River to the southwest. Other waterways include the Cold, Chubb, Bouquet, and Boreas rivers and Schroon and Paradox lakes; Lake Tear of the Clouds is regarded as the source of the Hudson River. The county, in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains, is entirely occupied by Adirondack Park (1892), which is one of the largest parks in the United States and the nation’s first forest preserve. Mount Marcy, in the central part of the county, is the highest point in the state (5,344 feet [1,629 metres]); surrounding peaks include Haystack, Skylight, Basin, Little Marcy, and Colden. The county is predominantly forested with spruce and fir trees, with stands of pine along Lake Champlain.
From the early 17th to the early 19th century, control over Lake Champlain was the prize in a struggle between the Indians, the French, the British, and the Americans. At the fortifications in Crown Point, the British dislodged the French (August 4, 1759), who in turn were ousted by the Green Mountain Boys (May 11, 1775). Similarly, Fort Ticonderoga was held by the French (1755–59) and the British (1759–75) until it was captured by Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys (May 10, 1775), after which it was recaptured but later released by the British (1777). The county was created in 1799 and named for Essex, England.
