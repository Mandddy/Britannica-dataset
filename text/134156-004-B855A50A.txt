Italo Svevo, pseudonym of Ettore Schmitz   (born Dec. 19, 1861, Trieste, Austrian Empire [now in Italy]—died  Sept. 13, 1928, Motta di Livenza, Italy) Italian novelist and short-story writer, a pioneer of the psychological novel in Italy.
Svevo (whose pseudonym means “Italian Swabian”) was the son of a German-Jewish glassware merchant and an Italian mother. At 12 he was sent to a boarding school near Würzburg, Ger. He later returned to a commercial school in Trieste, but his father’s business difficulties forced him to leave school and become a bank clerk. He continued to read on his own and began to write.
