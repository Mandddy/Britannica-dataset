Michael, Hebrew Mikhaʾel, Arabic Mīkāl or Mīkhāʾīl,  in the Bible and in the Qurʾān, one of the archangels. He is repeatedly depicted as the “great captain,” the leader of the heavenly hosts, and the warrior helping the children of Israel. Early in the history of the Christian church he came to be regarded as helper of the church’s armies against the heathen. He holds the secret of the mighty “word” by the utterance of which God created heaven and earth and was “the angel who spoke [to Moses] at Mount Sinai” (Acts 7:38). The numerous representations of Michael in art reflect his character as a warrior: he is shown with a sword, in combat with or triumph over a dragon, from the story in the Book of Revelation (Apocalypse).
The feast of St. Michael, which originated in Phrygia, is kept in both East and West on September 29. In the Roman Catholic Church the feast of the Appearing (or Apparition) of St. Michael the Archangel is kept on May 8. According to legend, this appearance took place on Mount Gargano, in Apulia, about 492, and the mountain became an important medieval pilgrimage site.
