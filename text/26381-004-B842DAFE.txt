Duncan Campbell Scott,  (born Aug. 2, 1862, Ottawa, Canada West [now Ontario, Can.]—died Dec. 19, 1947, Ottawa) Canadian administrator, poet, and short-story writer, best known at the end of the 20th century for advocating the assimilation of Canada’s First Nations peoples.
In 1879 Scott joined the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs; he reached the highest levels of this agency before retiring in 1932. During this period, Scott firmly supported the assimilationist policies of the Canadian government and advocated a policy of tribal termination, under which the indigenous peoples of Canada were to lose legal recognition and the protections and guarantees of their treaties with the government. The objective of these policies, he told a committee of the House of Commons in 1920, was “to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department.” He was also responsible for the supervision of Canada’s Residential Schools, a system of off-reservation boarding schools for indigenous children. Scott allowed school staff to use a variety of inhumane punishments to implement and enforce the assimilation of these children.
