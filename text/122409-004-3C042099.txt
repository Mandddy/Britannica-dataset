Bathythermograph,  any of various oceanographic devices containing temperature- and pressure-sensitive elements and producing a continuous record of underwater temperature and pressure. Recoverable bathythermographs, lowered from a ship at rest or in motion, produce this record on a coated glass slide. Expendable types, often dropped from aircraft, radio back information from depths up to 300 m (1,000 feet) and are frequently employed in making surveys of large areas.
