Baltasar Brum,  (born June 18, 1883, Salto, Uruguay—died  March 31, 1933, Montevideo) statesman noted for his reform of the educational and welfare systems in Uruguay and for his proposal of an American league of nations. His dedication to democracy was so firm that he committed suicide to protest the suspension of the Uruguayan constitution and assumption of dictatorial powers by President Gabriel Terra.
Brum’s first major posts were as minister of public education (1913–15) and minister of foreign affairs (1914–15). He served on the commission that revised the Uruguayan constitution (April–June 1917) and was the first president of the country under the new constitution (March 19, 1919–March 19, 1923). He became director of the prominent publication El Día (1923–29; “The Day”) and was president of the Council of National Administration (1929–31).
