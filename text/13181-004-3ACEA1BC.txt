Karl Barth,  (born May 10, 1886, Basel, Switzerland—died December 9/10, 1968, Basel) Swiss Protestant theologian, probably the most influential of the 20th century. Closely supported by his lifelong friend and colleague, the theologian Eduard Thurneysen, he initiated a radical change in Protestant thought, stressing the “wholly otherness of God” over the anthropocentrism of 19th-century liberal theology. Barth recovered the centrality of the doctrine of the Trinity within the dynamic and rational structure of Christian dogmatics; of particular importance was his reappropriation of the Christology of the ancient church. His vigorous opposition to German National Socialism led to his suspension as professor of theology at the University of Bonn. Subsequently, at Basel, he continued work on his monumental Church Dogmatics (completing four volumes) and delivered more than 500 sermons.
Barth was born in Basel, the son of Fritz Barth, a professor of New Testament and early church history at Bern, and Anna Sartorius. He studied at the universities of Bern, Berlin, Tübingen, and Marburg. At Berlin he attended the liberal theologian Adolf von Harnack’s seminar, and at Marburg he came under the influence of Wilhelm Herrmann and became deeply interested in the thought of the early 19th-century German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher and in the nature of scientific method. After serving a curacy in Geneva from 1909 to 1911, he was appointed to the working-class parish of Safenwil, in Aargau canton. In 1913 he married Nelly Hoffman, a talented violinist; they had one daughter and four sons.
