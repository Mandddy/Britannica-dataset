Karl Philipp, prince von Wrede,  (born April 29, 1767, Heidelberg, Palatinate—died  Dec. 12, 1838, Ellingen, Bavaria) Bavarian field marshal, allied with Napoleon until 1813, when he joined the coalition against France.
Educated for the career of a civil official in the Palatinate, he raised a volunteer corps that served with the Austrians, beginning in 1799. After the Treaty of Lunéville (1801) he was made lieutenant general in the Bavarian army and opposed the Austrian invasion of 1805. The Bavarians were for several years the active allies of Napoleon, and Wrede was engaged in a number of campaigns, notably in Prussia and the Tirol, even though the French were contemptuous of the Bavarian troops. In 1813 he returned to Bavaria in time to reorganize the Bavarian army when the nation finally resolved to join Napoleon’s enemies. In 1814 he led a corps in the invasion of France and supported field marshal Blücher’s vigorous policy. Made a prince in 1814, he played no part in subsequent campaigns but entered Bavarian politics as the opponent of Montgelas, whom he succeeded in 1817.
