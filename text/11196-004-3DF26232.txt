Nicolai Hartmann,  (born Feb. 20, 1882, Riga, Latvia, Russian Empire—died  Oct. 9, 1950, Göttingen, W.Ger.) one of the dominant figures in German philosophy during the first half of the 20th century.
After serving Germany in World War I, Hartmann taught philosophy at the universities of Marburg (1920–25), Cologne (1925–31), Berlin (1931–45), and Göttingen (1945–50). His first work, Platos Logik des Seins (1909; “Plato’s Logic of Being”), reflects his early Kantianism.
