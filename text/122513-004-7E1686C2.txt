Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella,  (born 1st century ad, Gades, Spain) Roman soldier and farmer who wrote extensively on agriculture and kindred subjects in the hope of arousing a love for farming and a simple life. He became in early life a tribune of the legion stationed in Syria, but neither an army career nor the law attracted him, and he took up farming in Italy.
The De re rustica, in 12 books, his second and fuller treatment of farming and country life, has survived, as has De arboribus (“On Trees”), which was part of an earlier work. Both are written in a lucid, nontechnical style. Of Husbandry (1745) is an English translation of De re rustica and De arboribus.
