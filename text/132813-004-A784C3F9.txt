Daniel Inouye, in full Daniel Ken Inouye  (born September 7, 1924, Honolulu, Hawaii [U.S.]—died December 17, 2012, Bethesda, Maryland) American Democratic politician who was the first U.S. representative of Hawaii (1959–63) and who later served as a U.S. senator (1963–2012). He was the first Japanese American to serve in both bodies of Congress.
Inouye was born to working-class parents of Japanese ancestry. His father had moved to Hawaii as a child, and his mother was born there. Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Inouye, who was a Red Cross medical aide, assisted in caring for victims of the raid. Intending to become a surgeon, he enrolled in the premedical program at the University of Hawaii. However, he left in March 1943 to join the 442nd Regimental Combat Team of the U.S. Army, a unit composed solely of Nisei (second-generation Japanese Americans), and he eventually attained the rank of second lieutenant. Inouye was seriously wounded in Italy in 1945, and his injuries necessitated the amputation of his right arm. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and several other honours as well as a promotion to captain.
