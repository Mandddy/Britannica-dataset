Mikhail Baryshnikov, in full Mikhail Nikolayevich Baryshnikov  (born January 28, 1948, Riga, Latvia, U.S.S.R.) Soviet-born American ballet dancer who was the preeminent male classical dancer of the 1970s and ’80s. He subsequently became a noted dance director.
The son of Russian parents in Latvia, Baryshnikov entered Riga’s opera ballet school at age 12. The success that he achieved there convinced him to devote himself to dancing. In 1963 he was admitted to the Vaganova ballet school (the training school for the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet in Leningrad [St. Petersburg]), where he was instructed by Aleksandr Pushkin. In 1966 he joined the Kirov Ballet as a soloist without having to serve the customary apprenticeship as a member of the corps de ballet. As the Kirov Ballet’s premier danseur noble, Baryshnikov appeared in the leading roles in Gorianka (1968) and Vestris (1969), two original ballets that had been especially choreographed for him.
