Gerard Swope,  (born Dec. 1, 1872, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.—died  Nov. 20, 1957, New York, N.Y.) president of the General Electric Company (1922–39; 1942–44) in the United States. He greatly expanded the company’s line of consumer products and pioneered profit-sharing and other benefits programs for its employees.
Fascinated by electricity early in life, Swope graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1895 and went to work for the Western Electric Company, becoming a director of the company in 1913. In 1919 he was appointed the first president of General Electric’s international subsidiary. An excellent salesman, he substantially increased the company’s foreign business and was made president of General Electric in 1922. At the time of his promotion the company primarily sold industrial electrical products, but under Swope’s direction it began to develop and market such household appliances as refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.
