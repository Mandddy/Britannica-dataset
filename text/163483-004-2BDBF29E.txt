Leonid Nikolayevich Andreyev,  Andreyev also spelled Andreev   (born Aug. 21 [Aug. 9, Old Style], 1871, Oryol, Russia—died  Sept. 12, 1919, Kuokkala, Fin.) novelist whose best work has a place in Russian literature for its evocation of a mood of despair and absolute pessimism.
At the age of 20 Andreyev entered St. Petersburg University but lived restlessly for some time. In 1894, after several attempts at suicide, he transferred to the University of Moscow, where he studied law. He became a barrister and then a law and crime reporter, publishing his first stories in newspapers and periodicals. Encouraged by Maksim Gorky, who became a close friend, he was at first regarded as Gorky’s successor as a Realist. His “Zhili-byli” (“Once There Lived . . .”) attracted attention and was included in his first collection of short stories (1901). Two stories of 1902, Bezdna (“The Abyss”) and V tumane (“In the Fog”), caused a storm by their candid and audacious treatment of sex. Andreyev’s work became widely discussed, and he acquired fame and wealth with a series of novels and short stories that, at their best, resemble Tolstoy in their powerful themes and ironic sympathy for suffering humanity. Among his best tales are Gubernator (1905; His Excellency the Governor) and Rasskaz o semi poveshennykh (1908; The Seven That Were Hanged).
