Thomas Tompion,  (baptized July 25, 1639, Ickwell Green, Northill, Bedfordshire, Eng.—died Nov. 20, 1713, London) English maker of clocks, watches, and scientific instruments who was a pioneer of improvements in timekeeping mechanisms that set new standards for the quality of their workmanship.
Nothing is known of Tompion’s formative years, and his father’s blacksmithing is the only known link with a metalworking trade prior to his admission to the Clockmakers’ Company in 1671, initially as a brother (apprentice) before gaining his freedom (journeyman status) in 1674. He was appointed clock maker for the new Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1676. Elected to the livery of the Clockmakers’ Company in 1691, he served as junior warden in 1700 and rose to master in 1703.
