Point Blank, American crime thriller film, released in 1967, that overcame weak box-office results to become a cult favourite, especially known for Lee Marvin’s lead performance as an emotionless man seeking revenge and for John Boorman’s stylish direction.
On the deserted prison island of Alcatraz, career criminal Walker (played by Marvin) is robbed by his partner Mal Reese (John Vernon) and left for dead. Walker returns to the mainland and remorselessly and violently works his way through the corporate criminal organization so he can kill Reese and get his money back.
