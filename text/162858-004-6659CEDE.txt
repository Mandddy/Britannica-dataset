Ruth Page,  (born March 22, 1899, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.—died April 7, 1991, Chicago, Illinois) American dancer and choreographer, who reigned as the grand dame of dance in Chicago from the 1920s to the 1980s.
Page’s father was a brain surgeon and her mother a pianist, and both encouraged her desire to dance, sending her to study with local teachers and, in 1914, introducing her to the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, a house guest. The young Page appeared briefly with Pavlova’s company that year. She moved to Chicago, appeared in Adolph Bolm’s The Birthday of the Infanta (1919), and for several years toured as premiere danseuse with Bolm’s Ballet Intime company, appearing in his Le Coq d’Or (1925) and in the premiere of Apollon Musagète (1928). She performed with Serge Diaghilev’s avant-garde Ballets Russes and had ballets choreographed for her by George Balanchine.
