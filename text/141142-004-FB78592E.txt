Wi-Fi, networking technology that uses radio waves to allow high-speed data transfer over short distances.
Wi-Fi technology has its origins in a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that released the bands of the radio spectrum at 900 megahertz (MHz), 2.4 gigahertz (GHz), and 5.8 GHz for unlicensed use by anyone. Technology firms began building wireless networks and devices to take advantage of the newly available radio spectrum, but without a common wireless standard the movement remained fragmented, as devices from different manufacturers were rarely compatible. Eventually, a committee of industry leaders came up with a common standard, called 802.11, which was approved by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1997. Two years later a group of major companies formed the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA, now the Wi-Fi Alliance), a global nonprofit organization created to promote the new wireless standard. WECA named the new technology Wi-Fi. Subsequent IEEE standards for Wi-Fi have been introduced to allow for greater bandwidth. The original 802.11 standard allowed a maximum data transmission rate of only 2 megabits per second (Mbps); 802.11n, introduced in 2007, has a maximum rate of 600 Mbps.
