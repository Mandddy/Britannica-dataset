Canary, (species Serinus canaria), popular cage bird of the family Fringillidae (order Passeriformes). It owes its coloration and sustained vocal powers to 400 years of selective breeding by humans. Varieties called rollers trill almost continuously, the notes running together; choppers have a loud trill of distinct notes. Well-known breeds include Hartz Mountain, Norwich, and Yorkshire. The average life span of a caged canary is 10â€“15 years; some have survived for more than 20 years.
The canary is native to the Canary, Azores, and Madeira islands. The wild form is streak-backed and mostly greenish brown. Among other members of the genus are the serin of Europe and the brimstone canary, or bully seedeater (S. sulphuratus) of Africa, which is also kept as a pet.
