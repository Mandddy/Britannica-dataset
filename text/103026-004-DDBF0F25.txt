Meath, Irish An Mh√≠, originally Mide, or Midhe,  county in the province of Leinster, northeastern Ireland. It is bounded by Counties Monaghan (north), Louth (northeast), Fingal (southeast), Kildare (south), Offaly (southwest), Westmeath (west), and Cavan (northwest); the Irish Sea lies on the east coast. Navan, in central Meath, is the county town (seat).
Crops and pasture cover almost the entire county, and there are a few patches of woodland, some peat bogs in the southwest, and small areas of hill pasture around Slieve na Calliagh in the northwest. The landscape of the county consists almost entirely of glacial drift. Rivers include the Blackwater and the Boyne. Many eskers, or long glacial gravel ridges, and deep deposits of rich glacial loam extend over a great part of Meath and north Kildare, giving the area rich agricultural and grazing lands.
