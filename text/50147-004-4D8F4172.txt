Electric potential, the amount of work needed to move a unit charge from a reference point to a specific point against an electric field. Typically, the reference point is Earth, although any point beyond the influence of the electric field charge can be used.
The diagram shows the forces acting on a positive charge q located between two plates, A and B, of an electric field E. The electric force F exerted by the field on the positive charge is F = qE; to move the charge from plate A to plate B, an equal and opposite force (F′ = −qE) must then be applied. The work W done in moving the positive charge through a distance d is W = F′d = −qEd.
