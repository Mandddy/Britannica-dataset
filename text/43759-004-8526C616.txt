Castor oil, also called Ricinus Oil,  nonvolatile fatty oil obtained from the seeds of the castor bean, Ricinus communis, of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). It is used in the production of synthetic resins, plastics, fibres, paints, varnishes, and various chemicals including drying oils and plasticizers. Castor oil is viscous, has a clear and colourless to amber or greenish appearance, a faint characteristic odour, and a bland but slightly acrid taste, with a usually nauseating aftertaste.
Castor oil is obtained from castor beans either by pressing or by solvent extraction. Both beans and oil are produced principally by India and Brazil and consumed primarily in the United States, largely in industry.
