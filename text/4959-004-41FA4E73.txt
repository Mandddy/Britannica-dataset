Benjamin F. Wade, in full Benjamin Franklin Wade   (born Oct. 27, 1800, Springfield, Mass., U.S.—died  March 2, 1878, Jefferson, Ohio) U.S. senator during the Civil War whose radical views brought him into conflict with presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.
In 1821 Wade’s family moved to Andover, Ohio. He studied law, was admitted to the bar, and formed a successful partnership in 1831 with the outspoken antislavery advocate Joshua R. Giddings. After a term as prosecuting attorney, Wade was elected in 1837 to the state Senate as a Whig. His determined antislavery stand cost him reelection in 1839, but he won another term in 1841. In 1847 he was elected by the legislature as president judge of the third judicial district. His businesslike, forceful methods won him popular attention, and the Whig-controlled legislature in 1851 elected him to the U.S. Senate. He was reelected to the Senate as a Republican in 1857 and 1863.
