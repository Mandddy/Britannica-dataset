Walther von der Vogelweide,  (born c. 1170—died c. 1230, Würzburg? [Germany]) the greatest German lyric poet of the Middle Ages, whose poetry emphasizes the virtues of a balanced life, in the social as in the personal sphere, and reflects his disapproval of those individuals, actions, and beliefs that disturbed this harmony. He was no respecter of persons: whoever came between him and his ideals, even the pope himself, received the full force of his anger.
The place of Walther’s birth has never been satisfactorily identified, though the title hêr, which he is given by other poets, indicates that he was of knightly birth. It is clear from his poetry that he received a formal education at a monastery school. He learned the techniques of his art at the Viennese court of Leopold V, duke of Austria, but, when one of the latter’s successors, Leopold VI, took up residence in Vienna, Walther failed to win his favour (for reasons perhaps connected with his rivalry with Reinmar von Hagenau, the most sophisticated of the earlier minnesingers, who was resident at the Viennese court). Instead, he gained the patronage of the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia, by writing in support of the Hohenstaufen cause against the Welf faction during their struggle for the kingship following the emperor Henry VI’s death in 1197. Pope Innocent III came out on behalf of the Welfs, and from this time dates the antipapal feeling that runs through much of Walther’s political poetry.
