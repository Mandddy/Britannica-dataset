Brattishing, also called cresting,  decorative architectural repeat motif applied to the top of a wall, screen, or roof. Widely used during the Gothic period (the 12th through the 15th century), it was frequently found on the bressummer, or superstructure, of a church and on the cornice of the church rood screen, a partition separating the east end of the nave from the chancel, or area around the altar.
Various ornamental designs have been used for brattishing. A continuous series of finials, for example, or small finishing spires, was often used; and the Tudor rose, as seen in the Henry VII Chapel (1503â€“19) at Westminster Abbey, was a favourite pattern in late medieval England.
