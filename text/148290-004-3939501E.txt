Horse show,  exhibition of horses and horsemanship, derived from the medieval tournaments and agricultural fairs of Europe. Horse shows range from small, informal affairs to elaborate week-long displays. Horses may be classed and judged by breed, by function (as hunting, jumping, polo, riding, or harness), or by such qualifications of horse or rider as age or number of ribbons previously won. In equitation classes only the skill of the rider is judged.
The Fédération Équestre Internationale and such member national organizations as the American Horse Shows Association regulate and promote the shows.
