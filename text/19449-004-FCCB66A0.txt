Tofu, also called bean curd,  soft, bland, custardlike food product made from soybeans. It is an important source of protein in the cuisines of China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Tofu is believed to date from the Han Dynasty (206 bc–ad 220).
Tofu is made from dried soybeans that are soaked in water, crushed, and boiled. The mixture is separated into solid pulp (okara) and soy “milk.” Coagulants such as calcium and magnesium chlorides and sulfates are added to the soy milk to separate the curds from the whey. The soy milk is poured into molds to allow the carbohydrate-laden whey to drain off. The resultant soft cakes are cut into squares and stored under water until sold, in bulk or in individual water-filled tubs.
