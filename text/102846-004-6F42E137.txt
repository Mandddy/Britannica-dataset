PJ Harvey, in full Polly Jean Harvey  (born October 9, 1969, Corscombe, near Yeovil, England) British singer-songwriter and guitarist whose mythically pitched, fanatically intense recordings and concerts set new standards for women in rock.
Harvey, born to countercultural parents in rural England, seems to have grown up with a sense of rock as simply another elemental force within the landscape. “Sheela-na-gig,” for instance, a single from her first album, Dry (1992), took as its central image the female exhibitionist carvings with gaping genitals found throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom, whose origins are the subject of debate. The song, like many others by Harvey, treats female sexuality as a ravaging, haunted force, but, instead of acting the victim, she theatrically embodies her obsessions, equates them with the alluring menace of rock and the blues, and builds herself into an archetype. In other hands—for example, those of the postpunk rocker Nick Cave, one of her major influences—such moves would run the risk of absurdity. But Harvey controls her self-presentation with extraordinary care: a skeletal figure with brightly reddened lips and an enigmatic smile, she uses polished diction even as the narrative takes her from teasing murmur to throttled scream.
