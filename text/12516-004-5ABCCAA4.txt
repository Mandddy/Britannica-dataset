Curassow,  any of numerous tropical American birds of the family Cracidae (order Galliformes). Strictly, it refers to 7â€“12 species in which the male is glossy black (often with white belly) and has a curled crest of feathers and a brightly coloured bill ornament; the female, lacking the ornament, is smaller and brownish. Curassows are game birds with delicious flesh. Large examples (to nearly 100 cm [40 inches]) are the great curassow (Crax rubra), from Mexico to Ecuador; the helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi), of the mountains of Venezuela and Colombia; and the razor-billed curassow (C. mitu), of the Amazon, which is critically endangered.
The chachalacas comprise 11 species and are the smallest and least arboreal members of the family. Typical is the plain chachalaca (Ortalis vetula), a 50-centimetre species, ranging from the Texas border to Nicaragua. Weighing about 0.5 kg (1 pound), it is brownish with a long green-glossed, white-tipped tail. At dawn and sundown, flocks call together from the treetops with regular, almost metronomic beat.
