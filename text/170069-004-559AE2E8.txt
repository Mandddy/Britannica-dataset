Plant hopper,  any member of several insect families of the order Homoptera, easily recognized because of the hollow, enlarged head extension that may appear luminous (see lanternfly). Plant hoppers feed on plant juices and excrete honeydew, a sweet by-product of digestion.
Plant hoppers, ranging in size from 1 cm (0.4 inch) in cooler climates to about 5 cm in the tropics, are not considered serious economic pests. Some species are covered with either a mealy substance or waxy filaments. Members of this family are variously known as fulgorid, lightning leafhopper, and mealy flata.
