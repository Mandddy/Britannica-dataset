Fairy bluebird (genus Irena), two species of birds in the family Irenidae (order Passeriformes), both of striking blue coloration and both confined to semi-deciduous forests in Asia. The blue-backed, or Asian, fairy bluebird (Irena puella) lives in the wetter parts of India, the Himalayas, southwestern China, and Southeast Asia. The Philippine fairy bluebird (I. cyanogaster) is found on Luzon, Polillo, Leyte, Samar, Mindanao, Dinagat, and Basilan. The two species are notable for the very long upper and lower tail coverts that almost conceal the tail. Males are brilliant blue and black; females are a duller turquoise. In both sexes the eyes are bright red. Fairy bluebirds call loudly at rest and in flight. (The blue-backed fairy bluebird has a distinct double whistle.) Fairy bluebirds are 27 cm (11 inches) long, with short legs, small feet, and slender bills. They eat insects, nectar, and fruit, especially figs.
Fairy bluebird is also commonly used as a name for numerous other bird species of Irenidae, a taxonomic grouping of disputed composition that is generally considered to include the leafbirds (Chloropsis) and ioras (Aegithina), as well as the fairy bluebirds. Some authors group the fairy bluebirds with the Old World orioles (family Oriolidae) and place the leafbirds and ioras in the family Chloropseidae. Others place all or most of these birds in the bulbul family (Pycnonotidae).
