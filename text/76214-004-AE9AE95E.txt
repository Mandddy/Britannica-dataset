Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, rugged wilderness area in southern Alaska, U.S., on the western shore of Cook Inlet, southwest of Anchorage. It was proclaimed a national monument in 1978, and the boundaries and name were altered in 1980 when it became a national park and preserve; the preserve adjoins the park to the west and southwest. The area of the park is 4,094 square miles (10,603 square km), and that of the preserve is an additional 2,204 square miles (5,708 square km).
Lake Clark is more than 40 miles (65 km) long and is the largest of more than a score of glacial lakes on the rim of the Chigmit Mountains, a range located where the Alaska and Aleutian ranges meet. The lake is the headwaters for the most important spawning ground for sockeye, or red, salmon in North America. The parkâ€™s great geologic diversity includes jagged peaks, granite spires, dozens of glaciers, and hundreds of waterfalls. There are two active volcanoes, Redoubt and Iliamna, in the Chigmit Mountains; both rise to more than 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) above sea level.
