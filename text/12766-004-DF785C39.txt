Henry Compton,  (born 1632, Compton Wynyates, Warwickshire, Eng.—died  July 7, 1713, Fulham, Middlesex) staunchly Protestant bishop of London (1675–1713) who played a leading part in English politics during the crisis of King James II’s reign.
Educated at Queen’s College, Oxford, Compton was ordained in 1666 and became bishop of Oxford in 1674 and of London in 1675. His Protestantism brought him into disfavour with the Roman Catholic James II, who in 1685 deprived him of his seat in the privy council. The next year, for refusing to suspend John Sharp, rector of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, whose antipapal sermons had offended the king, Compton was himself suspended. He gave his support to the seven bishops who made a petition against the king’s Declaration of Indulgence (1687), and he was the only ecclesiastic to sign the invitation to William of Orange to come to England to overthrow James.
