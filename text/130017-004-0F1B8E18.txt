Harpers Ferry, town, Jefferson county, in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, U.S. It lies at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland converge. When the town was part of Virginia, it was the site of the Harpers Ferry Raid, one of the major incidents precipitating the American Civil War, and of several battles of the war.
The town was settled in 1734 by Robert Harper, who established a ferry across the Potomac and a grist mill on the Shenandoah. The site was selected by President George Washington for a federal armoury because of its waterpower potential and was purchased from Harperâ€™s heirs in 1796. The town developed as an important U.S. arsenal and centre for the manufacture of rifles. In the 1830s the arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal turned the town into a commercial hub for a time.
