Discus fish, two species of the genus Symphysodon of fishes in the family Cichlidae (order Perciformes), characterized by a compressed, disk-shaped body. The two species (S. discus and S. aequifasciata) occur naturally in tributaries of the Amazon River in South America. Discus fish have an unusual form of parental care: the adults secrete a mucuslike substance onto their skin that provides nourishment for the young. Some reports indicate that both parents are involved in the care of the young, taking turns “nursing the babies.” Discus fish are difficult to keep in aquariums because of the strict water quality requirements necessary to keep them alive. Because of their spectacular wavy markings of blue and green, however, aquarium hobbyists persist in efforts to breed and raise them.
