Main-Danube Canal, also called Europa Canal, German Main-Donau-Kanal or Europa-Kanal,  commercial waterway in the southern German state of Bavaria. Completed in 1992, the canal is 171 km (106 miles) long and runs from Bamberg on the Main River (a tributary of the Rhine River) to Kelheim on the Danube River, permitting traffic to flow between the North Sea and the Black Sea. It thus creates a 3,500-km (2,200-mile) waterway that runs through 15 countries and can accommodate barges carrying up to 2,425 tons of bulk cargo. The canal, one of the largest civil engineering projects ever undertaken, has a total of 16 locks, each about 190 metres (625 feet) long, 12 metres (40 feet) wide, and up to 30 metres (100 feet) deep. It reaches a height of more than 406 metres (1,332 feet) over the Swabian Alps, south of Nürnberg.
The idea for such a canal dates back to 793, when Charlemagne, wishing to open a route through the centre of Europe for his battle fleet, had a channel excavated between two rivers in Bavaria: the Altmühl, a tributary of the Danube, and the Schwäbische Rezat, a tributary of the Main. Heavy rains caused the banks of the channel to collapse, however, and the project was abandoned. In 1837, under Ludwig I of Bavaria, work began on a canal between Bamberg and Kelheim, following much the same route as the modern canal. The Ludwig Canal remained in use until World War II, but it was never able to compete with the railways. In 1921 the German government and the state of Bavaria formed a company to build the much larger Main-Danube Canal. Before World War II the company enlarged the locks on the Main River, many locks also having hydroelectric power stations installed. Most of the construction of the canal itself took place between 1960 and 1992.
