Guggenheim Museum, international museum that collects and exhibits modern and contemporary art in New York City and other locations under the aegis of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. The Guggenheim’s component museums are the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City; the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy; the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain; and the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin in Germany.
The Guggenheim Museum grew out of the art-collecting activities of Solomon R. Guggenheim (1861–1949), who was part-heir to a fortune made in the American mining industry by his father, Meyer Guggenheim. Solomon began collecting abstract art in the 1920s, and in 1939 he founded the Museum of Non-Objective Painting to display his collection in New York City. This museum, which was owned and operated by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952.
