Panama disease, also called Banana Wilt,  a devastating disease of bananas caused by the soil-inhabiting fungus species Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. Panama disease, a form of Fusarium wilt, is widespread throughout the tropics and can be found wherever susceptible banana cultivars are grown. Notoriously difficult to control, the disease decimated global plantations of the Gros Michel banana in the 1950s and â€™60s, which had dominated the commercial industry until its downfall. Its replacement, the modern Cavendish, has been threatened with a strain of the disease known as Tropical Race (TR) 4 since the 1990s.
The Fusarium fungus invades young roots or root bases, often through wounds. Some infections progress into the rhizome (rootlike stem), followed by rapid invasion of the rootstock and leaf bases. Spread occurs through vascular bundles, which become discoloured brown or dark red, and finally purplish or black. The outer edges of older leaves turn yellow. Within a month or two all but the youngest leaves turn yellow, wilt, collapse, and hang downward, covering the trunk (pseudostem) with dead brown leaves. All aboveground parts are eventually killed, although fresh shoots may form at the base. These later wilt and the entire plant dies, usually within several years. The Fusarium fungus then continues to thrive in surrounding soil, preventing the success of future plantings.
