Rijsttafel, (
        Dutch: “rice table”) an elaborate meal of Indonesian dishes developed during the Dutch colonial era. The Dutch were likely inspired by a similar Indonesian multiple-dish meal known as nasi padang. While it remains popular in the Netherlands, many native Indonesians eschew rijsttafel because of its political overtones.
When the colonial Dutch returned home from Indonesia, they brought with them an affection for satay (spicy peanut) sauce, a handful of Indonesian stir-fry standards, and the practice of serving many small Indonesian dishes revolving around rice at once to best show off the archipelago’s diverse and flavourful cuisine. Born from this was the rijsttafel, consisting of rice and an array of such foods as curried meats, fish, chicken, vegetables, fruits, relishes, pickles, sauces, condiments, nuts, eggs, and so on. The diner is served a plate of rice and then chooses from among the side dishes to achieve a balance of salty, spicy, sweet, and sour flavours. A rijsttafel of 40 dishes was not uncommon, the meal sometimes taking three to four hours to consume.
