Papillon, breed of toy dog known from the 16th century, when it was called a dwarf spaniel. A fashionable dog, it was favoured by Madame de Pompadour and Marie-Antoinette, and it appeared in paintings by some of the Old Masters. The name papillon (French: “butterfly”) was given to the breed in the late 19th century, when a variety with large, flaring ears resembling the wings of a butterfly came into vogue. There is another variety of papillon with drooping ears. A slender, graceful dog with a plumed tail, the papillon stands 11 inches (28 cm) or less and weighs up to 11 pounds (5 kg). The coat is soft, full, and usually white with patches of black or of pale tan to dark reddish brown.
