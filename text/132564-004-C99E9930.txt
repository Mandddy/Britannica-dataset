Joyce C. Hall,  (born Dec. 29, 1891, David City, Neb., U.S.—died  Oct. 29, 1982, Leawood, Kan.) American businessman, cofounder and chief executive (1910–66) of Hallmark Cards, Inc., the largest greeting-card manufacturer in the world.
Using $3,500 that he had earned during high school, Hall established a wholesale greeting-card business in Kansas City, Mo., in 1910. Hall’s brother Rollie (d. 1968) later joined him, and the two began printing their own cards in 1916. A third brother, William (d. 1971), joined the firm in 1921. In many respects the Halls helped create the modern greeting-card industry, pioneering the sale of the inexpensive card-plus-envelope to replace the postcards and elaborate Valentines common prior to World War I. Other innovations by the Hall Brothers Co. (the “Hallmark” brand name, introduced in 1923, did not become part of the company’s name until 1954) included eye-catching display stands and radio and television advertising. The firm had achieved a national reputation by the 1920s, although it experienced its greatest growth after World War II.
