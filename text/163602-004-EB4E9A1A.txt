Bohemia, Czech Čechy, German Böhmen,  historical country of central Europe that was a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire and subsequently a province in the Habsburgs’ Austrian Empire. Bohemia was bounded on the south by Austria, on the west by Bavaria, on the north by Saxony and Lusatia, on the northeast by Silesia, and on the east by Moravia. From 1918 to 1939 and from 1945 to 1992, it was part of Czechoslovakia, and since 1993 it has formed much of the Czech Republic.
Bohemia’s name comes from a Celtic people known as the Boii, though the Slavic Czechs were firmly established in the region by the 5th or 6th century. Bohemia was briefly subordinated to Greater Moravia in the late 9th century. Saints Cyril and Methodius introduced Christianity into Bohemia from Moravia in the 9th century, and by the 10th century Bohemia had been Christianized and consolidated by the princes of the ruling Přemyslid dynasty. Although they gradually became dependent on the Holy Roman Empire, the Přemyslid rulers were able to attach Moravia to Bohemia and transform them into a viable kingdom. The Přemyslid prince Vratislav II (reigned 1061–92) was the first to obtain from the Holy Roman emperors the title of king of Bohemia as a personal (nonhereditary) privilege, and in 1198 the greatest of the Přemyslids, Otakar I, was named hereditary king of Bohemia, which became a kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire.
