Cenozoic Era, third of the major eras of Earth’s history, beginning about 66 million years ago and extending to the present. It was the interval of time during which the continents assumed their modern configuration and geographic positions and during which Earth’s flora and fauna evolved toward those of the present.
The term Cenozoic, originally spelled Kainozoic, was introduced by English geologist John Phillips in an 1840 Penny Cyclopaedia article to designate the most recent of the three major subdivisions of the Phanerozoic Eon. Derived from the Greek for recent life, it reflects the sequential development and diversification of life on Earth from the Paleozoic (ancient life) through the Mesozoic (middle life). Today, the Cenozoic is internationally accepted as the youngest of the three subdivisions of the fossiliferous part of Earth history.
