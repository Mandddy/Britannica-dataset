Ansett Transport Industries Limited, former Australian conglomerate founded in 1936 (as Ansett Airways Proprietary Ltd.) by Reginald Ansett. It ceased operations in 2001.
Ansett (Sir Reginald since 1969) began in 1931 with a motorcar passenger service in the Western District of the state of Victoria. In 1936 he founded the airline company for service between Melbourne and Hamilton. After World War II the company began new interstate services and manufacturing and in 1946 changed its name to Ansett Transport Industries Limited. By 1951 the company had extended its activities into hotels and was operating some 200 motor coaches. In 1957 it purchased Australiaâ€™s largest privately owned airline, Australian National Airways (renamed Ansett Airlines of Australia), and later acquired other regional airlines in Australia and New Guinea. The company secured a license for a television station in Melbourne in 1963 and another one in Brisbane in 1964. Further diversification in that era extended into motels, resorts, freight services, industrial equipment manufacturing, automotive sales, aircraft sales, etc. In 1979 media entrepreneur Rupert Murdoch gained control through majority interest in Ansett. Although Air New Zealand had acquired full ownership of the Australian air carrier in 2000, Ansett ceased operations in 2001.
