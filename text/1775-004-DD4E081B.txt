Mahalia Jackson,  (born Oct. 26, 1911, New Orleans, La., U.S.—died Jan. 27, 1972, Evergreen Park, near Chicago, Ill.) American gospel music singer, known as the “Queen of Gospel Song.”
Jackson was brought up in a strict religious atmosphere. Her father’s family included several entertainers, but she was forced to confine her own musical activities to singing in the church choir and listening—surreptitiously—to recordings of Bessie Smith and Ida Cox as well as of Enrico Caruso. When she was 16 she went to Chicago and joined the Greater Salem Baptist Church choir, where her remarkable contralto voice soon led to her selection as a soloist.
