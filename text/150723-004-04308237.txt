Grand Prix racing, automobile racing on closed highways or other courses somewhat simulating road conditions. Such racing began in 1906 and, in the second half of the 20th century, became the most popular kind of racing internationally.
From the beginning, Grand Prix racing was national and controlled by automobile manufacturers under the supervision of what came to be called the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA), which sets the specifications for all racing-car classes, including the Formula One for Grand Prix racing. The Formula One is generally smaller than the car used in speedway racing and is more maneuverable. All Grand Prix racing is for open-wheeled, single-seater (after 1924) cars, the engine size, fuel, and other elements being controlled by the FIA.
