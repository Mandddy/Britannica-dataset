Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), also called American antelope,  North American hoofed mammal, the sole living member of the old ruminant family Antilocapridae (order Artiodactyla). It is the only animal that has branching horns and sheds them annually. This graceful denizen of open plains and semideserts is reddish brown and white in colour, with a short, dark brown mane, white underparts, two white bands on the throat, and a large circular white patch of long hair on the rump. The rump patch can be suddenly erected to warn other pronghorns of danger; the flash of white from the rump patch can be seen by a human for 3–4 km (2–2.5 miles). Its common name to the contrary, it is not closely related to the antelopes.
Pronghorns stand about 80–100 cm (2.5–3.25 feet) at the shoulder; large northern males weigh about 40 kg (90 pounds) and the females slightly less. They are highly evolved runners. Faster than any Old World antelope, they can attain a speed of 70 km (40 miles) per hour and leap 6 metres (20 feet) at a bound. With eyes as large as those of elephants, pronghorns have astonishingly acute vision and can readily identify predators at distances of up to 1 km (0.6 mile). Their extreme adaptations reflect the severe predation on pronghorns during the Ice Age.
