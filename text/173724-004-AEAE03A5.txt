Bernardino Ochino,  (born 1487, Siena [Italy]—died 1564, Austerlitz, Moravia [now Slavkov u Brna, Czech Republic]) Protestant convert from Roman Catholicism who became an itinerant Reformer and influenced other radical Reformers by his controversial anti-Catholic views.
Taking his surname from the Sienese district dell’Oca, Ochino joined the Franciscan order in the Roman Catholic church about 1504, but in 1534 he left for the stricter Capuchin order, of which he became vicar-general (1538–42). His renown as a preacher soon prompted papal regulation of his appearances.
