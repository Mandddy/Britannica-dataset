Drury Lane Theatre, in full Theatre Royal Drury Lane,  oldest London theatre still in use. It stands in the eastern part of the City of Westminster.
The first theatre was built by the dramatist Thomas Killigrew for his company of actors as the Theatre Royal under a charter from Charles II. It opened May 7, 1663, in the propitious era of Restoration drama, and produced plays by John Dryden, among others. It was closed in 1665â€“66 but then prospered until being destroyed by fire (1672). Rebuilt on its present site in Drury Lane in 1674 with Sir Christopher Wren as its probable architect, the second Theatre Royal soon featured the works of William Congreve.
