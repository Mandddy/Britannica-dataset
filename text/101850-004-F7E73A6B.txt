Bremen, in full Free Hanseatic City-State of Bremen, German Freie Hansestadt Bremen,   city and Land (state), northwestern Germany. An enclave within the state of Lower Saxony, the state of Bremen comprises the German cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven. Bremen, the capital, is situated on the Weser River some 43 miles (70 km) from the North Sea. It is one of the largest ports of Germany and also one of the major industrial cities of northern Europe. Together with the port of Bremerhaven, situated 37 miles (60 km) to the north, it forms the smallest (in area and population) of the states of Germany but is of vital economic importance. This article describes both the state and the city that dominates it. Area city, 125 square miles (325 square km); state, 156 square miles (404 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) city, 547,934; state, 663,979.
Located at the first ford above the river estuary, the Old Town of Bremen grew on a sand dune, sited above flood level on the Weser spillway, the glacially widened river channel. The windblown sand accumulated, in the postglacial period, up to a height of 45 feet (15 metres) above the flat marshes and moors of the Bremer Becken (lowlands). Because of the effect of North Sea tides and of the high subterranean water level, 71 miles (114 km) of dikes, associated with a complicated drainage system, play an important role in the Bremen urban area. The dune—25 miles (40 km) long and 2 miles (3 km) wide—has thus decisively influenced the northward and southward expansion of the city. The territorial possessions of the city also include large sections of swampy cultivated lowlands and stretches along the Weser, which became associated with the rise of further smaller settlements. The gradual incorporation of these rural communities—which had always had close economic relations with Bremen—started in 1849 and in 1945 brought the administrative area of the city of Bremen to its contemporary size.
