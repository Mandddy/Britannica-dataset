Julius Streicher,  (born February 22, 1885, Fleinhausen, Germany—died October 16, 1946, Nürnberg) Nazi demagogue and politician who gained infamy as one of the most virulent advocates of the persecution of Jews during the 1930s.
Streicher served in the German army during World War I and afterward taught elementary school in Nürnberg. He joined the Nazi Party in 1921, becoming one of the earliest Nazis in southern Germany and a close friend of Adolf Hitler. In 1925 Streicher was appointed gauleiter (district leader) of Franconia, which, after the Nazis came to power in 1933, he administered from his chief bailiwick, Nürnberg. As the founder (1923) and editor of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper Der Stürmer, Streicher achieved a position of great wealth and influence in Nazi Germany. Der Stürmer’s crude anti-Jewish invective provided a focus for Hitler’s persecutory racial policies; the newspaper initiated the general campaign that led to the passage of the Nürnberg laws in 1935.
