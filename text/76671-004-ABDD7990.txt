Indiana Dunes, area of sand dunes, woodlands, wetlands, and other environments, located on the southern shore of Lake Michigan, northwestern Indiana, U.S. Much of the region is within Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which includes Indiana Dunes State Park. The national lakeshore extends almost 25 miles (40 km) between Gary and Michigan City and consists of a discontinuous band of parkland interrupted by steel mills, power plants, small communities, and a major harbour.
The state park, established in 1923 and opened in 1926, comprises 3.4 square miles (8.8 square km) of shoreline, marshland, dunes, and forests near Chesterton. In addition to a 3-mile (5-km) sandy beach, it has facilities for camping, picnicking, fishing, and hiking. An outstanding feature is the Big Blowout in the east end of the park, where lake winds have exposed a “tree graveyard” created by sands constantly drifting over a wooded area. Shifting dunes, such as Mount Tom, may reach heights of almost 200 feet (60 metres). Mount Baldy, 125 feet (38 metres) high, is moving inland at a rate of some 4 feet (1.2 metres) per year.
