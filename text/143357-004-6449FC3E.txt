Breyten Breytenbach, , pseudonym Jan Blom   (born Sept. 16, 1939, Bonnievale, S.Af.) exiled South African writer who was a leading Afrikaner poet and critic of apartheid. He became a naturalized French citizen.
Born into an Afrikaner Cape Province family, Breytenbach attended the English-language University of Cape Town but left school at age 20 for travel in Europe. In 1961 he settled in Paris. His first book of poetry, Die ysterkoei moet sweet (“The Iron Cow Must Sweat”), was published in 1964. Several books of poetry followed that were highly acclaimed in South Africa. He was allowed to travel with his Vietnamese wife (who was classified as Coloured by the South African government) to South Africa in 1973. He returned there in 1975 under an assumed name and was arrested as a terrorist and jailed for seven years. While incarcerated, Breytenbach continued to write; ’n Seisoen in die Paradys (A Season in Paradise) was published in 1976, and other prison writings were published as Mouroir: Bespieelende notas van ’n roman (Mouroir: Mirrornotes of a Novel) in 1983. In 1982 he was freed and allowed to leave South Africa. The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist (1984), his account of his arrest and detention, cemented his international reputation.
