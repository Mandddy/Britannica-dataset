Thermionic power converter, also called thermionic generator, thermionic power generator, or thermoelectric engine,  any of a class of devices that convert heat directly into electricity using thermionic emission rather than first changing it to some other form of energy.
A thermionic power converter has two electrodes. One of these is raised to a sufficiently high temperature to become a thermionic electron emitter, or “hot plate.” The other electrode, called a collector because it receives the emitted electrons, is operated at a significantly lower temperature. The space between the electrodes is sometimes a vacuum but is normally filled with a vapour or gas at low pressure. The thermal energy may be supplied by chemical, solar, or nuclear sources. Thermionic converters are solid-state devices with no moving parts. They can be designed for high reliability and long service life. Thus, thermionic converters have been used in many spacecraft.
