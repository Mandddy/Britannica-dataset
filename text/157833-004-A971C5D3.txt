David Fincher, in full David Leo Fincher  (born August 28, 1962, Denver, Colorado, U.S.) American music video and film director known for his stylish movies, which usually trended toward the dark and atmospheric.
Fincher was raised in San Anselmo, California, where he became interested in movies at a young age, in part because he was a neighbour of filmmaker George Lucas. Fincher was still a teenager when he became an assistant cameraman at Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Lucas’s special-effects studio. In the mid-1980s Fincher began directing commercials, which quickly led to a successful career as a music video director. He made some of the most iconic music videos of the 1980s and ’90s—including those for Madonna’s “Express Yourself” (1989) and “Vogue” (1990), as well as Aerosmith’s “Janie’s Got a Gun” (1989)—which were noted for their pronounced cinematic qualities, such as elaborate sets and deft camerawork.
