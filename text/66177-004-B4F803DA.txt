Mister Roberts, American comedy film, released in 1955, featuring acclaimed performances by Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, William Powell, and James Cagney.
Mister Roberts traces the misadventures of the frustrated crew of the USS Reluctant, a cargo ship operating in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. Fonda, who won a Tony Award for his performance in the Broadway production, reprised the role of Doug Roberts, an officer who wants to transfer to a fighting ship. The tyrannical captain (played by Cagney), however, keeps the capable and respected Roberts aboard in hopes of securing a promotion.
