Thomas Stanley, 1st earl of Derby, also called (1459–85) 2nd Baron Stanley   (born c. 1435—died July 29, 1504, Lathom, Lancashire, England) a prominent figure in the later stage of England’s Wars of the Roses.
Great-grandson of Sir John Stanley (died c. 1414), who created the fortunes of the Stanley family, Thomas Stanley began his career as a squire to King Henry VI in 1454. At the Battle of Blore Heath in August 1459, Stanley, though close at hand with a large force, did not join the royal army, while his brother William fought openly for York. In 1461 Stanley was made chief justice of Cheshire by Edward IV, but 10 years later he sided with his brother-in-law Warwick in the Lancastrian restoration. Nevertheless, after Warwick’s fall, Edward IV made Stanley steward of his household. About 1482 he married Margaret Beaufort (as his second wife), mother of the exiled Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII).
