Paula Radcliffe,  (born December 17, 1973, Northwich, Cheshire, England) British distance runner who set world records in the marathon.
Radcliffe was born into an athletic family. Her great-aunt Charlotte Radcliffe won an Olympic silver medal in the 4 Ã— 100-metre freestyle swimming relay in 1920, and Paula cheered on her father, a recreational runner, when he ran in the 1985 London Marathon. By the time she was a teenager, Radcliffe had emerged as a running talent. She won the world junior cross-country title in 1992 and then entered a period of steady but sometimes frustrating progress in global track championships. She finished seventh in the world championship 3,000 metres in 1993 and fifth in the 5,000 metres in the 1995 world championships and the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. In 1997 Radcliffe advanced to fourth in the 5,000 metres. Two years later, with her characteristic head-bobbing gait and eyes rolling back with the effort, she set the pace in the world championship 10,000 metres in Sevilla, Spain. However, she was passed on the last lap by Gete Wami of Ethiopia and finished second in 30 min 27.13 sec. At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, she pushed the pace again in the 10,000 metres, setting up an Olympic record for winner Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia but finishing fourth herself. Later that year Radcliffe won the world half marathon title, which signaled that her future might lie in the longer distances.
