Buenaventura Carles Aribau,  (born Nov. 4, 1798, Barcelona, Spain—died  Sept. 17, 1862, Barcelona) economist and author whose poem Oda a la patria (1832; “Ode to the Fatherland”) marked the renaissance of Catalan literature in the 19th century in Spain.
After working in Madrid at the banking establishment of Gaspar Remisa (1830–41), Aribau became the director of the treasury and financial secretary to the royal household. Animated by a deep patriotism, Aribau’s work is marked by the early Romanticist concern with history. He was one of the editors of El Europeo and El vapor, two of the most important periodicals of the Romantic movement, the latter heavily reflecting the medievalist influence of the British novelist Sir Walter Scott. His Oda a la patria, upon which his fame rests, was a defense of regional feeling, written in the vernacular of Catalan, which attempted to unite contemporary intellectual trends with native tradition. Aribau also edited, along with Manuel de Rivadeneyra, the first four volumes of the famous Biblioteca de autores españoles (“Library of Spanish Authors”), a monumental attempt to bring together all the important literature of Spain. (It filled 71 volumes upon completion in 1880.)
