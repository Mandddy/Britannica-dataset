Vascular system, in plants, assemblage of conducting tissues and associated supportive fibres. Xylem tissue transports water and dissolved minerals to the leaves, and phloem tissue conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant.
The condition of the xylem, the woody elements in the stem, defines several categories. The protostele has a solid xylem core; the siphonostele has an open core or one filled with generalized tissue called pith. The discontinuous vascular system of monocots (e.g., grasses) consists of scattered vascular bundles; the continuous vascular system of dicots (e.g., roses) surrounds the central pith.
