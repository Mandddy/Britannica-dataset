Rothschild family, the most famous of all European banking dynasties, which for some 200 years exerted great influence on the economic and, indirectly, the political history of Europe. The house was founded by Mayer Amschel Rothschild (b. Feb. 23, 1744, Frankfurt am Main—d. Sept. 19, 1812, Frankfurt) and his five sons, Amschel Mayer (b. June 12, 1773, Frankfurt—d. Dec. 6, 1855, Frankfurt), Salomon Mayer (b. Sept. 9, 1774—d. July 27, 1855, Vienna), Nathan Mayer (b. Sept. 16, 1777—d. July 28, 1836, Frankfurt), Karl Mayer (b. April 24, 1788—d. March 10, 1855, Naples), and Jakob, or James (b. May 15, 1792—d. Nov. 15, 1868, Paris). Starting out in a Frankfurt banking house, Mayer and his sons became international bankers, establishing branches in London, Paris, Vienna, and Naples by the 1820s.
The founder of the house was Mayer Amschel. The family’s name derived from the red (rot) shield on the house in the ghetto in which Mayer’s ancestors had once lived. Intended for the rabbinate, Mayer studied briefly, but his parents’ early death forced him into an apprenticeship in a banking house. Soon after becoming court factor to William IX, landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Mayer set the pattern that his family was to follow so successfully—to do business with reigning houses by preference and to father as many sons as possible who could take care of the family’s many business affairs abroad.
