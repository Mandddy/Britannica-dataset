Bonaventura Cavalieri,  (born 1598, Milan [Italy]—died  Nov. 30, 1647, Bologna, Papal States) Italian mathematician who made developments in geometry that were precursors to integral calculus.
As a boy Cavalieri joined the Jesuati, a religious order (sometimes called “Apostolic Clerics of St. Jerome”) that followed the rule of St. Augustine and was suppressed in 1668 by Pope Clement IX. Euclid’s works stimulated his interest in mathematics, and, after he met Galileo, Cavalieri considered himself a disciple of that great astronomer.
