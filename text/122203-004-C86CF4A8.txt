Pius VII, original name Luigi Barnaba Gregorio Chiaramonti  (born Aug. 14, 1742, Cesena, Papal States [Italy]—died Aug. 20, 1823, Rome) Italian pope from 1800 to 1823, whose dramatic conflicts with Napoleon led to a restoration of the church after the armies of the French Revolution had devastated the papacy under Pius VI.
He became a Benedictine at Cesena in 1758 and was made cardinal and bishop of Imola, Papal States, in 1785 by Pius VI, whose death in French captivity marked a collapse of the church’s central administration. Under Austrian protection at Venice, a 14-week conclave elected Chiaramonti on March 14, 1800.
