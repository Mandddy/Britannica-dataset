Palolo worm,  any of various segmented marine worms of the families Eunicidae and Nereidae (class Polychaeta, phylum Annelida). The palolo worm exhibits unique breeding behaviour: during the breeding season, always at the same time of year and at a particular phase of the Moon, the worms break in half; the tail section (the “epitoke”), bearing reproductive cells, swims to the surface, where it releases eggs and sperm. Tens of thousands of epitokes swarm and release gametes simultaneously, attracting predatory fish and humans. The front section of the worm (the “atoke”) remains below in the substrate.
Adults of the family Eunicidae are about 40 cm (16 inches) long and are divided into ringlike segments, each with paddlelike appendages bearing gills. Several sensory tentacles grow from the head. A pharynx that may be thrust forward is armed with teeth. Males of this family are reddish brown; females are bluish green.
