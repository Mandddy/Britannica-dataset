Boar, also called Wild Boar, or Wild Pig,  any of the wild members of the pig species Sus scrofa, family Suidae. The term boar is also used to designate the male of the domestic pig, guinea pig, and various other mammals. The term wild boar, or wild pig, is sometimes used to refer to any wild member of the Sus genus.
The wild boar—which is sometimes called the European wild boar—is the largest of the wild pigs and is native to forests ranging from western and northern Europe and North Africa to India, the Andaman Islands, and China. It has been introduced to New Zealand and to the United States (where it mixed with native feral species). It is bristly haired, grizzled, blackish or brown in colour, and stands up to 90 cm (35 inches) tall at the shoulder. Except for old males, which are solitary, wild boars live in groups. The animals are swift, nocturnal, and omnivorous and are good swimmers. They possess sharp tusks, and, although they are normally unaggressive, they can be dangerous.
