Henry-François Becque,  (born April 18, 1837, Neuilly, Fr.—died May 12, 1899, Paris) dramatist and critic whose loosely structured plays, based on character and motivation rather than on closely knit plots, provided a healthy challenge to the “well-made plays” that held the stage in his day. Although Becque disliked literary theory and refused identification with any school, he has been remembered as a forerunner of the Naturalist movement, whose chief exponent was the novelist Émile Zola.
From 1867 Becque tried his hand at various types of drama, including vaudeville and a play on a socialist theme. Les Corbeaux (1882; The Vultures, 1913), his masterpiece, describes a bitter struggle for an inheritance. The unvaried egotism of the characters and the realistic dialogue were unfavourably received, except by the Naturalist critics, and the play had only three performances. La Parisienne (1885; Parisienne, 1943) scandalized the public by its treatment of the story of a married woman and her two lovers. Its importance, like that of Les Corbeaux, was not recognized until a decade after its appearance. In his last years, a withdrawn and somewhat misanthropic figure, Becque devoted himself to journalism and to a drama of the financial world that he never completed.
