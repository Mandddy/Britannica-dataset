Floyd Mayweather, Jr., bynames Money and Pretty Boy  (born February 24, 1977, Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.) American boxer whose combination of speed, power, and technical prowess made him one of the best pound-for-pound fighters of his generation.
Mayweather earned the nickname “Pretty Boy” during his amateur career because of his unmarked face. He won the national Golden Gloves in 1993, 1994, and 1996 but ended his amateur career on a sour note at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where he lost a controversial decision to Serafim Todorov of Bulgaria in the semifinals and had to settle for a bronze medal in the featherweight division. He turned pro on October 11, 1996, scoring a second-round knockout of American Roberto Apodaca. Despite a bitter feud between his two trainers—his father, former boxer Floyd Mayweather, Sr., and his uncle Roger Mayweather, a former holder of the World Boxing Council (WBC) super featherweight (junior lightweight) and super lightweight (junior welterweight) titles—Mayweather flourished, winning the WBC junior lightweight title on October 3, 1998, in his 18th bout by stopping veteran American titleholder Genaro Hernandez in the eighth round. Mayweather also won Ring magazine’s Fighter of the Year award in 1998.
