Gardner Museum, in full Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum,  art collection located chiefly in Fenway Court, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. The main building, designed in the style of a 15th-century Venetian palace and built between 1899 and 1903, houses a collection that includes Asian art and Classical, medieval, and Renaissance sculpture and decorative arts, as well as masterpieces of European painting from the Middle Ages to the late 19th century. Many of the art objects in the collection were acquired for Isabella Stewart Gardner by the famed connoisseur Bernard Berenson.
 In 2012 the museum expanded to include a building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano. The new space, connected to the original building by an enclosed glass corridor, includes conservation laboratories, a music performance hall, greenhouses, and an exhibition space.
