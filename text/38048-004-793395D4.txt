Aleksandr Popov, in full Aleksandr Stepanovich Popov   (born March 4 [March 16, New Style], 1859, Turinskiye Rudniki [now Krasnoturinsk], Perm, Russia—died  Dec. 31, 1905, [Jan. 13, 1906], St. Petersburg) physicist and electrical engineer acclaimed in Russia as the inventor of radio. Evidently he built his first primitive radio receiver, a lightning detector (1895), without knowledge of the contemporary work of the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi. The genuineness and the value of Popov’s successful experiments are not seriously doubted, but Marconi’s priority is usually conceded.
Popov was the son of a village priest. He received his early education in an ecclesiastical seminary school and planned to enter the priesthood. But in 1877 his interests changed to mathematics, and he entered the University of St. Petersburg, from which he was graduated with distinction in 1883. Joining the teaching faculty of the university, he lectured in mathematics and physics in preparation for a professorship.
