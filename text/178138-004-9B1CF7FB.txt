Zhoukoudian, Wade-Giles Chou-k’ou-tien,  archaeological site near the village of Zhoukoudian, Beijing municipality, China, 26 miles (42 km) southwest of the central city. The site, including some four residential areas, has yielded the largest known collection of fossils of the extinct hominin Homo erectus—altogether some 40 incomplete skeletons, which are commonly known as the Peking man fossils. Remains of anatomically modern humans (H. sapiens) have also been excavated there. The discoveries at Zhoukoudian have proved vital to advancing the study of human evolution.
The hominin remains were found within a series of scree- and loess-filled clefts (inaccurately referred to as “caves”) in a limestone cliff. In 1921 the Swedish geologist and fossil hunter J. Gunnar Andersson became intrigued by tales of “dragon bones” that local people found in the clefts and used for medicinal purposes. Andersson explored the clefts and discovered some quartz pieces that could have been used as early cutting tools. This discovery lent credence to his theory that the bones were actually human fossils. In 1927 the Canadian anthropologist Davidson Black retrieved a hominin molar from the site. On the basis of that finding, he identified a previously unknown hominin group, which he named Sinanthropus pekinensis (i.e., Peking man). Large-scale excavations began in 1929.
