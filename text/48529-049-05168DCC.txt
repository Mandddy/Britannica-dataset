Ron Toomer, in full Ronald Valentine Toomer  (born May 31, 1930, Pasadena, California, U.S.—died September 26, 2011, Bedford, Texas) American engineer and roller coaster designer who could be considered the sovereign of steel coasters. His work with Arrow Dynamics (founded as Arrow Development Company in 1946) brought to life such influential steel thrillers as the tubular track Runaway Mine Ride (1966), the inverted helix-shaped Corkscrew (1975), and the first suspended coasters of the 1980s.
A mechanical engineering graduate of the University of Nevada–Reno (1961, B.S.), Toomer was involved in the first U.S. satellite launches and served on the team that designed the heat shield for the Apollo spacecraft. During his stint in the space program, Toomer met a coworker who had previously been a welder for the Arrow Development Company. In 1965 Toomer joined the company and was hired to work on the design of the Runaway Mine Ride, the world’s first all-steel coaster.
