George Steinbrenner, in full George Martin Steinbrenner III  (born July 4, 1930, Rocky River, Ohio, U.S.—died July 13, 2010, Tampa, Fla.) American businessman and principal owner of the New York Yankees (1973–2010). His exacting methods and often bellicose attitude established him as one of the most controversial personalities in major league baseball. Though he was often criticized, under his ownership the Yankees became one of the dominant teams in baseball and one of the most valuable franchises in sports.
Steinbrenner was raised in a suburb of Cleveland, Ohio. After attending Culver Military Academy (1944–48), a preparatory school in Indiana, he earned a bachelor’s degree in English (1952) from Williams College in Massachusetts. Upon graduation he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and served for two years. He later received a master’s degree in physical education from The Ohio State University (1955) and was an assistant coach for the football teams at Northwestern and Purdue universities.
