Pole vault, sport in athletics (track and field) in which an athlete jumps over an obstacle with the aid of a pole. Originally a practical means of clearing objects, such as ditches, brooks, and fences, pole-vaulting for height became a competitive sport in the mid-19th century. An Olympic event for men since the first modern Games in 1896, a pole-vault event for women was added for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
In competition, each vaulter is given three chances to clear a specified height. A bar rests on two uprights so that it will fall easily if touched. It is raised progressively until a winner emerges by process of elimination. Ties are broken by a “count back” based on fewest failures at the final height, fewest failures in the whole contest, or fewest attempts throughout the contest. The pole may be of any material: bamboo poles, introduced in 1904, quickly became more popular than heavier wooden poles; glass fibre became the most effective and popular by the early 1960s. The poles may be of any length or diameter.
