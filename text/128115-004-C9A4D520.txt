Coral snake, any of about 90 species of small, secretive, and brightly patterned venomous snakes of the cobra family (Elapidae). New World coral snakes range in size from 40 to 160 cm (16 to 63 inches) and are classified in three different genera; they are found mainly in the tropics. Five additional genera of related snakes live in Asia and Africa. Most species are tricoloured (rarely bicoloured), with various combinations of red, black, and yellow or white rings; width of the rings varies. All have thin cylindrical bodies, smooth scales, and a short tail. Short hollow fangs deliver a potent neurotoxic venom.
Sixty-five species of American coral snakes (genus Micrurus) range from the southern United States to Argentina. Only two species live in the United States. The eastern coral snake, or harlequin snake (M. fulvius), is about a metre (3.3 feet) long and has wide red and black rings separated by narrow rings of yellow. The Arizona coral snake (Micruroides euryxanthus) is a small (40–50-cm) inhabitant of the American Southwest. The rhyme “Red on yellow, kill a fellow, red on black, venom lack” distinguishes coral snakes from similar North American snakes. There are 50 genera of coral snake mimics such as false coral snakes (see king snake and scarlet snake), and nearly one-third of all American species have some coral snake pattern.
