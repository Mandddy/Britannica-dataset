High jump, sport in athletics (track and field) in which the athlete takes a running jump to attain height. The sport’s venue  includes a level, semicircular runway allowing an approach run of at least 15 metres (49.21 feet) from any angle within its 180° arc. Two rigid vertical uprights support a light horizontal crossbar in such a manner that it will fall if touched by a contestant trying to jump over it. The jumper lands in a pit beyond the bar that is at least 5 by 3 metres (16.4 feet by 9.8 feet) in size and filled with cushioning material. The standing high jump was last an event in the 1912 Olympics. The running high jump, an Olympic event for men since 1896, was included in the first women’s Olympic athletics program in 1928.
The only formal requirement of the high jumper is that the takeoff of the jump be from one foot. Many styles have evolved, including the now little-used scissors, or Eastern, method, in which the jumper clears the bar in a nearly upright position; the Western roll and straddle, with the jumper’s body face-down and parallel to the bar at the height of the jump; and a more recent backward-twisting, diving style often termed the Fosbury flop, after its first prominent exponent, the 1968 American Olympic champion Dick Fosbury.
