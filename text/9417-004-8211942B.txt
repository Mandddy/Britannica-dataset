Mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa), also called sewellel,  a muskrat-sized burrowing rodent found only in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Unlike the American and Eurasian beavers (genus Castor), the mountain beaver has an extremely short tail and is less than a half metre (1.6 feet) in length; weight is less than 2 kg (4.4 pounds).
It is characterized by small rounded ears, small eyes, short and robust limbs with five digits on each foot, and a white spot under the ears. All digits except the thumb (pollex) end in long, curved, sharp claws; the thumb is partially opposable and bears a nail. The animal is dark grayish to reddish brown on the upperparts and gray beneath, its short coat composed of a dense underfur with scattered guard hairs. Mountain beavers are solitary and have acute tactile and olfactory senses but limited ability to see and hear. Their vocalizations are limited to a soft whining, sobbing sound when in pain, grating produced by the teeth, and a high squeal when fighting.
