Joachim du Bellay,  (born c. 1522, Liré, Fr.—died  Jan. 1, 1560, Paris) French poet, leader with Pierre de Ronsard of the literary group known as La Pléiade. Du Bellay is the author of the Pléiade’s manifesto, La Défense et illustration de la langue française (The Defence &amp; Illustration of the French Language).
Du Bellay was born into a noble family of the Loire River valley, and he studied law and the humanities in Poitiers and Paris.  He published The Defence &amp; Illustration of the French Language in 1549. In it he asserted that French is capable of producing a modern literature equal in quality and expressiveness to that of ancient Greece and Rome. He argued that French writers should look not only to Classical texts but also to contemporary Italy for literary models. In 1549–50 du Bellay published his first sonnets, inspired by the Italian poet Petrarch.
