Semiautomatic pistol, handgun that utilizes either recoil or blowback to discharge the empty cartridge, reload, and cock the piece after each shot. The semiautomatic pistol dates from the very late 19th century, when developments in ammunition made possible cartridges and bullets that would feed or cycle smoothly through an autoloading mechanism
There are few pistols that are fully automatic—that is, capable of cycling and discharging a magazine of cartridges with a single squeeze of the trigger. Though often termed “automatic,” the common semiautomatic pistol fires only one shot at each pull of the trigger. Unlike semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, semiautomatic pistols are virtually never operated by combustion gases. Rather, they most often employ the blowback mode of operation in which the breechblock or bolt is locked in firing position but is free to be thrust backward by the same burst of energy that propels the bullet forward. The rearward thrust ejects the spent cartridge from the chamber, while storing energy in a spring which in turn projects the bolt assembly forward and injects a fresh cartridge into the chamber.
