Slave code, in U.S. history, any of the set of rules based on the concept that slaves were property, not persons. Inherent in the institution of slavery were certain social controls, which slave owners amplified with laws to protect not only the property but also the property owner from the danger of slave violence. The slave codes were forerunners of the black codes of the mid-19th century.
Slave rebellions were not unknown, and the possibility of uprisings was a constant source of anxiety in the American colonies—and, later, in the U.S. states—with large slave populations. (In Virginia during 1780–1864, some 1,418 slaves were convicted of crimes; 91 of the convictions were for insurrection and 346 for murder.) Slaves also ran away. In the British possessions in the New World, the settlers were free to promulgate any regulations they saw fit to govern their labour supply. As early as the 17th century, a set of rules was in effect in Virginia and elsewhere; but the slave codes were constantly being altered to adapt to new needs, and they varied from one colony—and, later, one state—to another.
