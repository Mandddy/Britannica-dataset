Giotto, European space probe that came within 596 km (370 miles) of the nucleus of Halley’s Comet on March 13, 1986.
Giotto was named after the 14th-century Italian painter Giotto di Bondone, whose 1305–06 fresco The Adoration of the Magi includes a realistic depiction of a comet as the Star of Bethlehem in the Nativity scene; this image is believed to have been inspired by the artist’s observation of the passage of Halley’s Comet in 1301.
