Tahr (genus Hemitragus), any of three wary and sure-footed wild goatlike mammals of the family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), native to Asia. Tahrs live in herds and frequent steep, often wooded mountainsides. They range in shoulder height from 60 to 106 cm (24 to 42 inches), depending on the species. Both sexes have short, flattened horns that curve backward.
The Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), found from Kashmir to Sikkim, is reddish brown to dark brown. The male has a full mane covering the neck and forequarters. An adult male can weigh up to 120–140 kg (260–310 pounds), while females weigh about 60 kg (130 pounds). The Nilgiri tahr, or Nilgiri ibex (H. hylocrius, or, by some classifications, Nilgiritragus hylocrius), of southern India, is dark brown with a grizzled saddle-shaped patch on its back; its body size is comparable to that of the Himalayan species. The Arabian tahr (H. jayakari) is the smallest of the three species; an adult male weighs about 40 kg (90 pounds), while females are 17–20 kg (37–44 pounds). It is gray brown (females and subadult males) or blonde (fully adult males), with a brittle, relatively short coat. It is found in small, scattered populations throughout a 600-km (400-mile) crescent of northern Oman and a very small area of the United Arab Emirates. The rut is in autumn and early winter for all three species.
