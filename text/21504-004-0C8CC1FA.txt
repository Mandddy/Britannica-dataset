Anna Howard Shaw,  (born Feb. 14, 1847, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, Eng.—died July 2, 1919, Moylan, Pa., U.S.) American minister, lecturer, and, with Susan B. Anthony, one of the chief leaders of the National American Woman Suffrage Association.
Shaw moved with her parents to the United States from her native England in 1851. She grew up from 1859 on an isolated frontier farm near Big Rapids, Michigan. Her father’s absence, her mother’s nervous breakdown, and her elder brother’s illness forced 12-year-old Anna to undertake the tasks of clearing the land, planting crops, finishing the poor cabin, and caring for the family. She received a year or two of schooling, which she supplemented with reading on her own, and at age 15 she became a teacher in a frontier schoolhouse. At the end of the Civil War she moved to the home of a married sister in Big Rapids and enrolled in the local high school.
