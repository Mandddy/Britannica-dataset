Common frog,  (species Rana temporaria), largely terrestrial frog (family Ranidae), native to Europe, from Great Britain to central Russia. It is known in continental Europe as either grass frog or russet frog. The common frog is smooth-skinned, and adults are 7 to 10 cm (2.8 to 3.9 inches) long. Colour and markings vary from gray to greenish, brown, yellowish, or red with few to many spots of reddish brown or black.
The common frog frequents damp, shaded areas. It breeds in the spring, when water temperature reaches about 14 °C (57 °F). The females lay 1,000 to 4,000 eggs. The eggs hatch quickly, and tadpoles metamorphose in roughly three months.
