William Cobbett, pseudonym Peter Porcupine   (born March 9, 1763, Farnham, Surrey, Eng.—died  June 18, 1835, London) English popular journalist who played an important political role as a champion of traditional rural England against the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.
His father was a small farmer and innkeeper. Cobbett’s memories of his early life were pleasant, and, although he moved to London when he was 19, his experiences on the land left their impressions on his life. Cobbett’s careers as a journalist and, for the last three years of his life, as a member of the House of Commons were devoted to restoring his ideal of rural England in a country rapidly being transformed by the Industrial Revolution into the world’s foremost manufacturing nation.
