Stilt,  any of certain species of shorebirds belonging to the family Recurvirostridae (order Charadriiformes), characterized by long thin legs and a long slender bill. Stilts are about 35 to 45 centimetres (14 to 18 inches) in length. They live in warm regions, around ponds, where they probe in mud and weedy shallows for crustaceans and other small aquatic animals.
The common stilt (Himantopus himantopus) is variably black and white with pink legs and red eyes. Among its races are the black-winged stilt (H. h. himantopus), of the Old World, and the black-necked stilt (H. h. mexicanus), of the New World; and very dark birds occur in New Zealand.
