Bandicoot,  any of about 22 species of Australasian marsupial mammals comprising the family Peramelidae. (For Asian rodents of this name, see bandicoot rat.) Bandicoots are 30 to 80 cm (12 to 31 inches) long, including the 10- to 30-centimetre (4- to 12-inch) sparsely haired tail. The body is stout and coarse haired, the muzzle tapered, and the hind limbs longer than the front. The toes are reduced in number; two of the hind digits are united. The teeth are sharp and slender. The pouch opens rearward and encloses 6 to 10 teats. Unlike other marsupials, bandicoots have a placenta (lacking villi, however). Most species have two to six young at a time; gestation takes 12â€“15 days.
Bandicoots occur in Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and nearby islands. They are terrestrial, largely nocturnal, solitary animals that dig funnellike pits in their search for insect and plant food. Farmers consider them pests; some species are endangered, and all have declined.
