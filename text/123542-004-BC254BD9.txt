Methamphetamine, also called d-desoxyephedrine, byname Speed,  potent and addictive synthetic stimulant drug that affects the central nervous system (the spinal cord and brain). It was used widely for legal medical purposes throughout much of the 20th century. In the United States it was marketed under the brand names Methedrine and Desoxyn, and it was widely administered to industrial workers in Japan in the 1940s and ’50s to increase their productivity.
Methamphetamine, which increases physical activity and suppresses the appetite, is of limited usefulness in the treatment of attention deficit disorder, narcolepsy, and obesity. However, heavy or prolonged use may produce powerful side effects, including aggression and paranoia, kidney and lung disorders, brain and liver damage, chronic depression, immune deficiency disorders, convulsions, and schizophrenia. It is normally taken in pill form or, as a crystalline powder (“crystal meth”), sniffed through a hollow tube; it may also be taken intravenously.
