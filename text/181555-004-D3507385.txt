Ana María Matute,  (born July 26, 1925, Barcelona, Spain—died June 25, 2014, Barcelona) Spanish novelist known for her sympathetic treatment of the lives of children and adolescents, their feelings of betrayal and isolation, and their rites of passage. She often interjected such elements as myth, fairy tale, the supernatural, and fantasy into her works.
Matute’s education suffered because of childhood illnesses, the family’s frequent moves between Barcelona and Madrid, and the disruptions of the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), which left her family largely housebound in Barcelona. She broke the monotony of the war years by editing a magazine for her siblings. While in her teens, she published short stories and became a professional musician.
