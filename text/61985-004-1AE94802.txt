Jessie Ann Benton Frémont, née Jessie Ann Benton  (born May 31, 1824, near Lexington, Va., U.S.—died Dec. 27, 1902, Los Angeles, Calif.) American writer whose literary career arose largely from her writings in connection with her husband’s career and adventures and from the eventful life she led with him.
Jessie Benton was the daughter of Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri. She was well educated, mainly privately, and was notably independent and spirited. In 1840 she met Lieutenant John C. Frémont, a young officer in the Topographical Corps, and in 1841, over her father’s strong opposition, they were secretly married. Senator Benton chose to make the best of it and began using his considerable influence to further his son-in-law’s career as an explorer.
