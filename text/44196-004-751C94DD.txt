Catnip (Nepeta cataria), also called catmint,  herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae), noted for its aromatic leaves, which are particularly exciting to cats. Catnip is commonly grown by cat owners for their pets, and the dried leaves are often used as a stuffing for cat playthings. The herb is native to Eurasia and is used as a seasoning and as a medicinal tea for colds and fever in some places.
Catnip is a short-lived perennial herb. The stems are typically square and bear oppositely arranged toothed leaves. The plant produces spikes of small white purple-dotted flowers and readily reseeds itself. The leaves and stems contain a volatile oil known as nepetalactone, which stimulates sensory neurons in most cats, attracting them to the plant. The effect generally lasts about 10 minutes and triggers a wide range of behaviours, including purring, rolling, vocalizations, head rubbing, drooling, jumping, and sometimes aggression.
