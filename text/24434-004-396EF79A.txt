Jean-François Ducis,  (born Aug. 22, 1733, Versailles, France—died  March 31, 1816, Versailles) French dramatist who made the first sustained effort to present William Shakespeare’s tragedies on the French stage. Although he remodeled the tragedies to the French taste for witty, epigrammatic style and attempted to confine the plays within the “classical unities” (of time, place, and action), such critics as Voltaire still raged against what he called Shakespeare’s “barbarous histrionics.” Nonetheless, Ducis achieved great success with his principal adaptations—from Hamlet (1769), which he saw mainly as a lesson in filial piety, through his works titled Roméo et Juliette (1772), Le Roi Lear (1783), Macbeth (1784), and Othello (1792).
Ducis came from a bourgeois family, rising through his position as secretary to several powerful figures of the court. He knew no English and thus was hampered from the start by having to work with the mediocre translations of two contemporaries, Pierre-Antoine de La Place and Pierre Le Tourneur. Aware of his uncomfortable position between an audience with specific tastes and a body of brilliant but largely unfamiliar works in an alien style, he attempted to compromise the plays, buying exposure for them by revising the texts and, in some cases, even by changing the catastrophes. Nevertheless, his adaptations have a certain vigorous eloquence.
