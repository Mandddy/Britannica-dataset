Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF), institute in San Francisco, Calif., comprising two separate museums, the de Young and the Legion of Honor. Together the museums contain the cityâ€™s largest art collection.
The de Young, located in Golden Gate Park and founded in 1895, is the older of the two museums. Its highly regarded collection of American paintings features more than 1,000 works dating from colonial to contemporary times. Disrepair and earthquake damage forced the museum to close in 2000 for a sweeping renovation. On Oct. 15, 2005, with a new building designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, the de Young reopened as a state-of-the-art facility, extending over 293,000 square feet (27,220 square metres).
