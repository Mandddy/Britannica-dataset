Wigeon, also spelled widgeon,  any of four species of dabbling ducks (family Anatidae), popular game birds and excellent table fare. The European wigeon (Anas, or Mareca, penelope) ranges across the Palaearctic and is occasionally found in the Nearctic regions. The American wigeon, or baldpate (A. americana), breeds in northwestern North America and winters along the U.S., Mexican, Central American, and Caribbean coasts, as well as on some inland waters. The white crown, green eye stripe, and brown back distinguish the male of this American species from the similar male European wigeon, which has a reddish head, cream forehead, and gray back. Baldpates often graze like geese on young grasses, and they are fond of eelgrass, which they will steal from diving ducks such as the canvasback. The male Chiloé wigeon (A. sibilatrix) of South America helps raise the young—a rare trait among ducks. The Cape wigeon (A. capensis) of Africa is a nocturnal feeder.
