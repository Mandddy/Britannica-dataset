Pontus de Tyard,  (born c. 1522, Bissy-sur-Fley, Burgundy, Fr.—died  Sept. 23, 1605, Bragny-sur-Saône) Burgundian poet and member of the literary circle known as La Pléiade who was a forthright theorist and a popularizer of Renaissance learning for the elite.
Tyard was seigneur (lord) of Bissy-sur-Fley and an associate of the Lyonese poets, especially Maurice Scève. In 1551 he translated León Hebreo’s Dialoghi di amore (“Dialogues of Love”), the breviary of 16th-century philosophic lovers. His poetry collection Erreurs amoureuses (1549; “Mistakes in Love”), which include one of the first French sonnet sequences, also revived the sestina in France. The Erreurs was augmented in successive editions, as was his important prose work, Discours philosophiques (“Philosophical Discourses”), a Neoplatonic encyclopaedia finally completed in 1587. Its first treatise, the Solitaire premier (1552), complements Joachim du Bellay’s Défense et illustration de la langue française (1549), which expounded the theories on poetic diction and language reform of La Pléiade. In 1578 Tyard was given the bishopric of Chalon-sur-Saône, from which he retired in 1594.
