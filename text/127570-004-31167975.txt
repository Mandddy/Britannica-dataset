Thomas Newcomen,  (baptized Feb. 28, 1664, Dartmouth, Devon, Eng.—died Aug. 5, 1729, London) British engineer and inventor of the atmospheric steam engine, a precursor of James Watt’s engine.
As an ironmonger at Dartmouth, Newcomen became aware of the high cost of using the power of horses to pump water out of the Cornish tin mines. With his assistant John Calley (or Cawley), a plumber, he experimented for more than 10 years with a steam pump. It was superior to the crude pump of Thomas Savery. In Newcomen’s engine the intensity of pressure was not limited by the pressure of the steam. Instead, atmospheric pressure pushed the piston down after the condensation of steam had created a vacuum in the cylinder.
