Whipbird, also called Coachwhipbird,  either of the four songbird species of the Australian genus Psophodes, assigned to various families depending on the classification used. They are named for the voice of the eastern whipbird (P. olivaceus): the male gives a long whistle and a loud crack, and the female answers instantly with “choo” sounds. This species is 25 cm (10 inches) long, with broad, graduated tail, and is dark green, with white cheeks. The other, and similar, species is rare.
