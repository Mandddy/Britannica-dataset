Zion National Park, dramatic landscape of colourful deep canyons, high cliffs, mesas, and forested plateaus in southwestern Utah, U.S. The park lies on the northwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau about 30 miles (50 km) northeast of the city of St. George. Cedar Breaks National Monument is nearby to the northeast, Bryce Canyon National Park and Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument are nearby to the east, Pipe Spring National Monument and the north rim of Grand Canyon National Park are to the south, and Parashant National Monument is to the southwest.
The park’s principal feature is Zion Canyon, which received its name from the Mormons who discovered it (1858) and settled there in the early 1860s. A portion of the area was first set aside as Mukuntuweap National Monument in 1909. The monument was enlarged and renamed Zion National Monument in 1918 and was established as a national park in 1919. The park was enlarged in 1956, by the addition of adjacent land that had also been named Zion National Monument but is now called Kolob Canyons; the entire park now occupies 229 square miles (593 square km).
