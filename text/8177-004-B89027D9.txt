Bichon frise, (
        French: a modification of bichon à poil frisé, “curly-haired lap dog”) breed of small dog noted for its fluffy coat and cheerful disposition. For many centuries it was known as the “bichon” or “Tenerife.” Descended from the water spaniel, it is about 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) tall and features a short blunt muzzle, silky ears that drop, and a puffy, silky, curled coat and an undercoat. Its colour is for the most part pure white, though some have shadings of cream, buff, or apricot around the ears or on the body.
The bichon frise originated in the area of the Mediterranean Sea, as did other breeds of bichons—for instance, the Maltese, Bolognese, and Havanese—to which the bichon frise is related. Spanish sailors are believed to have introduced bichons frises to the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands, and there, in the 14th century, Italian sailors found them and returned them to Europe. The breed enjoyed four centuries of favour from royalty and the new middle class, especially in France in the late 16th century, when King Henry III carried the little dogs in a basket attached to ribbons around his neck. They appeared in paintings by Francisco de Goya, but by the late 19th century aristocratic fancies had turned to other dogs, and bichons frises performed in the circus and with organ-grinders or were pets belonging to commoners. French breeders began breeding them after World War I. In the 1930s, renamed “bichons frises,” they became recognized as show dogs. Bichons frises were first brought to the United States in 1956, and the first litter was delivered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The breed was fully recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1972.
