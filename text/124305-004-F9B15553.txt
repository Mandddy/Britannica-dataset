Art Institute of Chicago, museum in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., featuring European, American, and Asian sculpture, paintings, prints and drawings, decorative arts, photography, textiles, and arms and armour, as well as African, pre-Columbian American, and ancient art. The museum contains more than 300,000 works of art. It is especially noted for its extensive collections of 19th-century French painting (Impressionist works in particular) and 20th-century painting and sculpture.
The Art Institute was established in 1866 as the Chicago Academy of Design. It was reestablished as the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in 1879, and it took its current name in 1882. In 1893 it moved to its present building, which covers an entire city block bounded by Columbus Drive and Michigan Avenue between Jackson and Monroe streets. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge for the World’s Columbian Exposition. Greeting visitors to the museum are two bronze lions designed by sculptor Edward Kemeys; their “names” are, unofficially, “on the prowl” (north lion) and “stands in an attitude of defiance” (south lion). The museum also has sculpture gardens (begun after a donation by Mrs. Stanley McCormick in the 1960s) and an interior courtyard restaurant. Educational spaces, including the Morton Auditorium, provide facilities for expanding public knowledge about the arts.
