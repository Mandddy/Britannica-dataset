Brown bear (Ursus arctos), shaggy-haired bear (family Ursidae) native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern North America. More than 80 forms of the brown bear have been described; they are treated as several subspecies of Ursus arctos. North American brown bears are traditionally called grizzlies (see grizzly bear).
Brown bears are omnivorous and feed on berries, plant roots and shoots, small mammals, fish, calves of many hoofed animals, and carrion. They often cache food in shallow holes, and they dig readily and vigorously in search of rodents. Except in some southern areas, bears retire to dens in winter; they accumulate large amounts of fat during late summer and autumn. Cubs, usually twins, are born in winter after about six to eight months of gestation. At birth a cub weighs less than a kilogram.
