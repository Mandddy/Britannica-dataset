Isaac I Comnenus ,  (born c. 1005—died c. 1061, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]) Byzantine emperor who restored economic stability at home and built up the neglected military defenses of the empire.
Isaac was a son of Manuel Comnenus, an officer of the Byzantine emperor Basil II. On his deathbed, Manuel commended Isaac and his other son, John, to the emperor’s care. After having them educated, Basil advanced them to high positions. Isaac, by his prudent conduct in protecting the peoples of the empire, won the confidence of the army during the reigns of Basil’s successors.
