Robert Greene,  (born July 1558?, Norwich, Eng.—died  Sept. 3, 1592, London) one of the most popular English prose writers of the later 16th century and Shakespeare’s most successful predecessor in blank-verse romantic comedy. He was also one of the first professional writers and among the earliest English autobiographers.
Greene obtained degrees at both Cambridge and Oxford. He then went to London, where he became an intimate of its underworld. He wrote more than 35 works between 1580 and 1592. To be certain of supplying material attractive to the public, Greene at first slavishly followed literary fashions. His first model was John Lyly’s Euphues.
