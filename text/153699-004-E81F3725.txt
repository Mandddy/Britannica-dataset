York, county, northern South Carolina, U.S. North Carolina forms the northern border, the Catawba River part of the eastern border, and the Broad River part of the western border. On the northern border is Lake Wylie, created by one of the stateâ€™s first hydroelectric projects, the Catawba Dam on the Catawba River. York county lies in a hilly piedmont region. The eastern portion is urban, while the western section remains rural. Part of Kings Mountain National Military Park, site of an important battle during the U.S. War of Independence, is in the northwest, near Kings Mountain State Park.
In the 17th century Catawba and Cherokee Indians agreed to make the region a neutral area between their tribal lands where both could hunt in peace. European settlers arrived in the mid-18th century, and York county was established in 1785. It was named for James II of England, who, prior to ascending the throne, had been the duke of York. After the American Civil War it became a centre of Ku Klux Klan activity.
