Billy Joel, in full William Martin Joel  (born May 9, 1949, Bronx, New York, U.S.) American singer, pianist, and songwriter in the pop ballad tradition. His greatest popularity was in the 1970s and â€™80s.
The son of a German-Jewish Holocaust survivor but raised as a Roman Catholic in Hicksville, a middle-class suburb on Long Island, New York, Joel was steered toward classical music by his parents and began piano lessons at age 4. At age 14, enamoured of the British Invasion and soul music, he began playing in bands. With the Hassels, he recorded two albums in the late 1960s, and a stint in the heavy metal duo Attila followed.
