Carlo Cattaneo,  (born June 15, 1801, Milan—died  Feb. 6, 1869, near Lugano, Switz.) Italian publicist and intellectual whose writings significantly shaped the Risorgimento and whose journal, Il Politecnico (“The Polytechnic”), not only served as a vehicle for his political views but also was influential in introducing new scientific and technical improvements into Italy.
During Cattaneo’s early career as a schoolmaster and as a graduate in law at the University of Padua (1824), he acquired a tremendous scope of knowledge: his writings treat such diversified subjects as literature and fine arts, philosophy, language, mathematics, chemistry, geology, agriculture, and penal reform, as well as various other economic, social, and political problems of his time. Considered Italy’s first proponent of positivism, he tried to clarify the complex relations between morality and economics. His important scholarly work Notizie naturali e civili su la Lombardia (1844; “Natural and Civil Reports on Lombardy”) gained him election to the prestigious Lombard Institute.
