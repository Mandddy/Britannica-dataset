Kathryn Bigelow, in full Kathryn Ann Bigelow  (born November 27, 1951, San Carlos, California, U.S.) American film director and screenwriter, noted for action films that often featured protagonists struggling with inner conflict. She was the first woman to win an Academy Award for best director, for The Hurt Locker (2008).
Bigelow studied painting at the San Francisco Art Institute, and in the early 1970s she moved to New York City to participate in the Whitney Museum’s independent study program. She soon became interested in filmmaking and eventually earned a scholarship to the graduate film school at Columbia University. There she made the short film The Set-Up (1978). After graduating from Columbia in 1979, Bigelow began working on her first feature-length movie, The Loveless, which she cowrote and codirected (with Monty Montgomery). The 1982 drama, starring a then unknown Willem Dafoe, focused on a motorcycle gang’s visit to a small Southern town and the ensuing violence. Bigelow was subsequently sent a number of scripts, most of which were high-school comedies. Uninterested in the offers, she instead began teaching at the California Institute of the Arts in 1983.
