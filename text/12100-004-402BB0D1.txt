Fanny Elssler,  (born June 23, 1810, Vienna, Austria—died  Nov. 27, 1884, Vienna) Austrian ballerina who introduced theatricalized folk dance (character dance) into ballet. She was celebrated for her spirited, spectacular dancing and for her technique, especially her point work.
Daughter of a valet and copyist for the composer Franz Joseph Haydn, she studied under Jean-Pierre Aumer and made childhood appearances at the Kärntnerthor Theatre with her sister Theresa, also a dancer. Engagements in Naples, Berlin, and London brought her international fame. After three months of intensive study with Auguste Vestris, she made her Paris Opéra debut in 1834 in Jean Co-alli’s ballet La Tempête, derived from William Shakespeare’s The Tempest. Her immediate success divided Parisian balletomanes into two camps, since the warmth and spontaneity of her dancing was in marked contrast to the ethereal lightness of her greatest rival, Marie Taglioni. Théophile Gautier called Elssler “the Spaniard from the north.” In La Gypsy (1839), made famous by her performance of the cracovienne, a Polish folk dance, and in La Tarentule (1839), she revealed extraordinary pantomimic ability. Her sensational success in Le Diable boiteux (1836), in which she introduced the Spanish cachucha, challenged Taglioni’s supremacy. To unseat her rival, still called the greatest classical ballerina, she made one attempt in Taglioni’s favourite ballet, La Sylphide; the endeavour was most unsuccessful, since she lacked Taglioni’s lightness and elevation.
