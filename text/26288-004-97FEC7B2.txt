William Shenstone,  (born Nov. 18, 1714, Leasowes, Halesowen, Shropshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 11, 1763, Leasowes) a representative 18th-century English “man of taste.” As a poet, amateur landscape gardener, and collector, he influenced the trend away from Neoclassical formality in the direction of greater naturalness and simplicity.
From 1745, in response to the current vogue for the ferme ornée (“ornamental farm”; i.e., one that was as picturesque as it was profitable), he devoted his chief energies to beautifying his estate, the Leasowes, by “landscape gardening,” a term he was the first to use. His theories, outlined in “Unconnected Thoughts on Gardening” (1764), involved the creation of winding waterways and walks and a series of picturesque views.
