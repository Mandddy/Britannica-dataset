Taj Mahal, original name Henry Saint Clair Fredericks  (born May 17, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.)  American singer, guitarist, songwriter, and one of the pioneers of what came to be called world music. He combined blues and other African-American music with Caribbean and West African music and other genres to create a distinctive sound.
Taj Mahal (the name came to him in a dream) grew up in a musical family. His father, of Jamaican background, was a jazz musician and arranger; his mother, a schoolteacher, sang gospel music. While a student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in the early 1960s, he began exploring the origins of African-American music and focused on acoustic blues. Following graduation, he played in folk clubs until he moved to California in 1965. There he teamed up with Ry Cooder to form the band Rising Sons.
