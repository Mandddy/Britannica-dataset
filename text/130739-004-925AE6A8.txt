Spreadsheet, computer program that represents information in a two-dimensional grid of data, along with formulas that relate the data. Historically, a spreadsheet is an accounting ledger page that shows various quantitative information useful for managing a business. Electronic spreadsheets all but replaced pen-and-ink versions by the end of the 20th century. Spreadsheets are not limited to financial data, however, and are frequently used to represent scientific data and to carry out computations.
The first spreadsheet program was VisiCalc, written for the Apple II computer in 1979. In the view of many users, it was the application that most vividly showed the utility of personal computers for small businesses—in some cases turning a 20-hour-per-week bookkeeping chore into a few minutes of data entry. For example, a simple spreadsheet might hold payroll information with columns for employees’ names and addresses, social security numbers, hourly pay, hours worked, tax deductions, and net pay. Cells in the last column could have a formula attached to them to compute pay as a function of cells in the three preceding columns for each employee. The spreadsheet would show the net pay and, upon request, its formula. If tax-withholding rates were changed, all the net pay cells would be recomputed.
