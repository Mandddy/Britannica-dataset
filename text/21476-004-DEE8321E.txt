Sophie Tucker, original name Sophie Kalish, also called Sophie Abuza  (born Jan. 13, 1884, Russiaâ€”died Feb. 9, 1966, New York, N.Y., U.S.) American singer whose 62-year stage career included American burlesque, vaudeville, and nightclub and English music hall appearances.
Born somewhere in Russia as her mother was on her way to join her father in the United States, Sophie Kalish grew up in Boston and then in Hartford, Connecticut, where her mother ran a restaurant. Her father had changed the family name to Abuza after his arrival in the United States. From her childhood she wanted to be an entertainer, and she began by singing in the family restaurant, in part to escape waiting on tables and dishwashing. In 1906 she changed her name to Sophie Tucker and landed a few singing jobs.
