Toadfish, any of about 80 species of bottom-living fishes constituting the family Batrachoididae and the order Batrachoidiformes. They are found chiefly in the New World and mostly in warm seas—occasionally in freshwater. Toadfishes are heavy-bodied fishes with broad, flattened heads and large mouths equipped with strong teeth. They grow to a maximum of about 40 cm (16 inches) and either are scaleless or have small scales. Most can produce audible grunting or croaking sounds. Toadfishes are carnivorous and sometimes bite when touched.
They are divided into three groups: true toadfishes, such as the oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), a common resident of shallow coastal waters along eastern North America; venomous toadfishes (Thalassophryne and Daector), found in Central and South America and notable for inflicting painful wounds with the hollow, venom-injecting spines on their dorsal fins and gill covers; and midshipmen (Porichthys), shallow-water American fishes named for numerous (600–840) small, buttonlike light organs arranged in rows along the body.
