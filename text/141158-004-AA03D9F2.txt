Netbook, informal classification for a variety of small, low-cost mobile personal computers (PCs) used primarily for e-mail and Internet access.
Netbooks split the difference between traditional, full-service laptop PCs, or notebooks, and smaller, more-limited devices such as Web-enabled “smart phones” and personal desktop assistants (PDAs). Most models retail for significantly less than traditional laptops, weigh less than a kilogram (less than two pounds), and typically feature display screens that measure only about 25 cm (10 inches) diagonally. Keyboards may be up to 20 percent smaller than those used on standard laptops. Early netbooks ran either Microsoft Corporation’s Windows XP Home Edition or a custom configuration of the free operating system Linux. Typically, netbooks support Internet communication via high-speed Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Their size precludes optical storage devices, but they usually include slots for solid-state flash memory cards.
