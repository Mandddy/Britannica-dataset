Battles of Mars-la-Tour and Gravelotte, (Aug. 16–18, 1870), two major engagements of the Franco-German War in which the 140,000-man French Army of the Rhine, under Marshal Achille-François Bazaine, failed to break through the two German armies under General Helmuth von Moltke and were bottled up in the fortress of Metz. It was followed by the Count de Mac-Mahon’s abortive attempt to rescue Bazaine, which ended in Mac-Mahon’s crushing defeat at Sedan.
The French Army had been in retreat and its command in a state of shock since German victories in the first week of August. Bazaine was given command of the Army of the Rhine on August 12, as it was falling back from Metz toward Verdun. He was intercepted on August 16 by the German general Constantine von Alvensleben’s III Corps of 30,000 men near Vionville, east of Mars-la-Tour. Alvensleben, with one-quarter the troops of Bazaine, captured and secured Vionville, thus blocking the French escape route toward the west. The resulting Battle of Mars-la-Tour included the last major cavalry engagement in western Europe. Each side suffered about 16,000 casualties.
