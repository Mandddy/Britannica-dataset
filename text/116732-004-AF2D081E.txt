Stirlingshire, also called Stirling,  historic county, central Scotland. In the west it borders Loch Lomond and incorporates a section of the Highlands. It extends east into the Midland Valley (Central Lowlands) between the Rivers Forth and Kelvin. At the centre of Stirlingshire the volcanic Campsie Fells and Kilsyth and Gargunnock hills form an elevated mass amid the Lowlands. In the east the county fronts the shore of the River Forth estuary. The northern portion of Stirlingshire lies within the Stirling council area. Along the River Kelvin in the southwest the Lennox area is part of East Dunbartonshire, and the area around Kilsyth lies in North Lanarkshire. Southeastern Stirlingshire constitutes the Falkirk council area.
Archaeological research has uncovered evidence of Neolithic settlement in Stirlingshire. The Antonine Wall, locally known as Grahamâ€™s Dyke, was constructed by the Romans in ad 142; it connects the Rivers Forth and Clyde and passes through southeastern Stirlingshire. Many Roman relics have been found at Castlecary and Camelon. After the withdrawal of the Romans, the native Picts gradually retreated before the advance of the Anglo-Saxons and Scots. Stirling received a royal charter from David I (c. 1130) and became a trading centre.
