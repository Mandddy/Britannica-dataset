São Francisco River, Portuguese Rio São Francisco ,  major river of eastern South America. With a length of 1,811 miles (2,914 kilometres), it is the fourth largest river system of the continent and the largest river wholly within Brazil. The São Francisco has been called the “river of national unity,” for it long has served as a line of communication between Brazil’s maritime and western regions and between the northeast and the south. The river is named for the 16th-century Jesuit leader St. Francis Borgia (São Francisco de Borja). It is an important source of hydroelectric power and irrigation for eastern and northeastern Brazil. The São Francisco basin occupies some 243,700 square miles (631,200 square kilometres).
The São Francisco River rises at about 2,400 feet (730 metres) above sea level on the eastern slope of the Serra da Canastra in southwestern Minas Gerais state, about 150 miles northwest of the city of Belo Horizonte. The river flows for more than 1,000 miles northward across the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia, through the extensive Sobradinho Reservoir, to the twin cities of Juàzeiro and Petrolina. In this stretch the river receives its main left-bank tributaries—the Paracatu, Urucuia, Corrente, and Grande rivers—and its main right-bank tributaries—the Verde Grande, Paramirim, and Jacaré.
