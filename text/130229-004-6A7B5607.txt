Hantavirus, any member of a genus of viruses (Hantavirus) of the family Bunyaviridae that cause acute respiratory illnesses in humans. The hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses, each of which has been evolutionarily adapted to a specific rodent host. Human infection occurs where people come into unusual and intense contact with infected rodent populations, mainly through inhaling dust containing dried rodent excreta in and around the home but also in the wild.
There are several different hantaviruses, each with its specific rodent carrier, and they cause two basic groups of disease. The first group is known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS); these illnesses are characterized by acute fever, internal bleeding, and kidney failure. One of the first HFRS illnesses to be characterized was Korean hemorrhagic fever (also called hemorrhagic nephroso-nephritis), recognized during the Korean War (1950â€“53). Korean hemorrhagic fever is fatal in 10 to 15 percent of cases. It is caused by the Hantaan virus and is carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), a type of wood mouse that is prevalent in Asia and eastern Europe. A second HFRS disease, nephropathia epidemica, is usually not fatal. It is caused by the Puumala virus, which is carried by the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Nephropathia epidemica has occurred in Scandinavia, western Russia, and other parts of Europe.
