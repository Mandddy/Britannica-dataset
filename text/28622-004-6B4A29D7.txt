Benedict XIV, original name Prospero Lambertini  (born March 31, 1675, Bologna, Papal States [Italy]â€”died May 3, 1758, Rome) pope from 1740 to 1758. His intelligence and moderation won praise even among deprecators of the Roman Catholic Church at a time when it was beset by criticism from the philosophers of the Enlightenment and its prerogatives were being challenged by absolutist monarchs. Typical of his pontificate were his promotion of scientific learning and his admonition to those in charge of drawing up the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Forbidden Books) to act with restraint.
Of a noble family, he received a doctorate in theology and law from the University of Rome. In 1728 he was created a cardinal, and in 1731 he was made archbishop of Bologna by Pope Clement XII, whom on Aug. 17, 1740, he was elected to succeed.
