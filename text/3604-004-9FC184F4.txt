Quipu, Quechua khipu (“knot”), quipu also spelled quipo,  an Inca accounting apparatus in use from c. 1400 to 1532 ce and consisting of a long textile cord (called a top, or primary, cord) with a varying number of pendant cords. The pendant cords may also have cords (known as subsidiaries) attached. Experts believe that—in addition to the various knots placed there—a cord’s composition, ply, length, end treatment, and colour were all significant factors in a quipu’s use and meaning.
The type of knot tied and its position on the pendant relative to the top cord records a numeric value. Three basic types of knot, each with two possible orientations (called “S” and “Z”), have been identified: an “E-knot,” or figure-8 knot, is shaped somewhat like the numeral 8 and represents a single unit; a “long knot” in which the cord is wrapped around itself from 2 to 9 times represents a number from 2 to 9, depending on the number of times it is wrapped; and a single knot (a simple standard knot) represents 10 or multiple powers of 10, depending on its relative position to the top cord. The numeric value of a cluster of single knots is determined by counting the number of knots in the cluster and multiplying it by 10.
