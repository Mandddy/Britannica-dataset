Red Deer River, river in southern Alberta, Canada, a major tributary of the South Saskatchewan River. Rising in the Front Ranges of the Canadian Rocky Mountains in Banff National Park, the river flows northeast and then southeastward for 450 miles (724 km) before entering the South Saskatchewan River at a point 5 miles (8 km) across the Saskatchewan border. The Red Deer (which was misnamed by early Scottish settlers, who confused elk that inhabited the area with red deer of Scotland) flows through the cities of Red Deer and Drumheller and through Dinosaur Provincial Park, a site where dinosaur fossils have been found. In its lower reaches, the river has cut deeply into the surface of the plains. Extensive badlands line its banks.
