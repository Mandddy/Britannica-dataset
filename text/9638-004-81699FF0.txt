Pilot whale (genus Globicephala), also called blackfish or pothead,  either of two species of small, slender toothed whales with a round, bulging forehead, a short beaklike snout, and slender, pointed flippers. Pilot whales are about 4–6 metres (13–20 feet) long and are found in all the oceans of the world except the Arctic. Males are larger than females, but both are black and some have a pale, elongated, anchor-shaped mark adorning the throat and chest.
Highly gregarious, this cetacean lives in groups numbering from dozens to hundreds or even thousands of individuals and feeding mainly on squid. Pilot whales are one of the species that will mass strand, a phenomenon in which an entire school beaches itself. Scientists have been unable to agree on a cause for this behaviour.
