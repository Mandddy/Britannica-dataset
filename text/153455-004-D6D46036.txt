Pantanal, floodplain in south-central Brazil that extends into northeast Paraguay and southeast Bolivia. It lies mainly within the Brazilian estados (states) of Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso. The Pantanal is one of the world’s largest freshwater wetlands, and the extent of its seasonally dynamic area is estimated to be from 54,000 square miles (140,000 square km) to 81,000 square miles (210,000 square km). The wetlands extend for about 375 miles (600 km) north-to-south along the banks of the upper Paraguay River and several of its tributaries, including the São Lourenço and the Taquari rivers.
The Pantanal is a gigantic seasonal floodplain. During the summer rainy season (November–March), the rivers overflow their banks and flood the adjacent lowlands, forming shallow lakes and innumerable swamps and marshes and leaving islandlike areas of higher ground. During the drier winter season (April–September), the rivers withdraw into their banks, but the lowlands are only partially drained. Studies have shown that there is also a network of underground streams that facilitates the subsurface flow of water. The sediments carried by the floods confer great fertility on the Pantanal’s soils, which support scattered trees, rushes, grasses, and vibrant flowers.
