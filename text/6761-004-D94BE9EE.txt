Bon, also called Bon Matsuri, orUrabon,  one of the most popular annual festivals in Japan, observed July 13–15 (August 13–15 in some places), honouring the spirits of deceased family ancestors and of the dead generally. It is, along with the New Year festival, one of the two main occasions during the year when the dead are believed to return to their birthplaces. Memorial stones are cleaned, community dances performed, and paper lanterns and fires are lit to welcome the dead and to bid them farewell at the end of their visit.
The word Urabon was probably derived from the Sanskrit Avalambana (All Souls Day), a Buddhist ceremony based on the Avalambana-sūtra (Urabon-kyō in Japanese). The sutra relates the story of Maudgalyāyana, a disciple of the Buddha, who secured his mother’s release from hell by having monks offer food, drink, and shelter to the spirits of his ancestors. Though observed as a Buddhist festival, Bon is not exclusively so and reflects the ancient theme of close continuity in Japanese religious life between the living and the dead.
