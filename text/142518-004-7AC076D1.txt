Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), U.S. legislation that provided civil rights protections to individuals with physical and mental disabilities and guaranteed them equal opportunity in public accommodations, employment, transportation, state and local government services, and telecommunications. The act, which defined disability as a “physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities,” was signed into law by Pres. George H.W. Bush on July 26, 1990, with widespread bipartisan support.
The ADA’s employment provisions applied to all employers with 15 or more employees; those with 25 or more were given until the middle of 1992 to comply, while those with 15–24 employees had until mid-1994 to come into compliance. The public-accommodations provisions—which required that necessary changes be made to afford access by persons with disabilities to all public facilities, including restaurants, theatres, day-care centres, parks, institutional buildings, and hotels—generally went into effect early in 1992.
