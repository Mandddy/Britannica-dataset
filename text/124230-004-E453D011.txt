Water shrew, any of 12 species of amphibious shrews that have a broad, fleshy muzzle, large chest, and long hind legs and digits. Most water shrews live in montane habitats and forage in clear, cold streams and small rivers. They use all four feet to swim, but most of the propulsive force comes from the hind feet. Their relatively large brain is associated with enlarged nerves leading to the shrewsâ€™ abundant and sensitive whiskers, which are used to locate prey underwater by touch. Water shrews do not hunt by using smell, sight, or hearing, as their olfactory regions of the brain are reduced, their eyes small, and their ears hidden in fur.
Their soft, very dense fur is blackish but slightly paler or white on the underparts. The longer hairs in its coat, instead of being rounded, as in terrestrial shrews, are grooved on each side (H-shaped in cross section), and the grooves contain numerous ridges. This configuration helps trap air, providing the coat with water-repellent properties and increased insulation to counter heat loss while submerged. The long tail is finely furred.
