Joachim Lelewel,  (born March 22, 1786, Warsaw, Poland—died May 29, 1861, Paris, France) prominent Polish historian, regarded as one of the founders of modern Polish historical thought.
Descendant of a Polonized German family, Lelewel completed his studies at the Polish University of Wilno, received an assistant professorship there (1815–24), and then a full professorship in European history (1822–24). Deprived of his chair by the Russian governor, he moved to Warsaw, where he engaged in political activity. After the defeat of the Polish insurrection of 1830–31, he set out on foot across Germany to Paris. Expelled from France upon the intervention of the Russian ambassador, he walked to Brussels, where he published his writings in French.
