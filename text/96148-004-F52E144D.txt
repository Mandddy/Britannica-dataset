Sea snake, any of more than 60 species of highly venomous marine snakes of the cobra family (Elapidae). There are two independently evolved groups: the true sea snakes (subfamily Hydrophiinae), which are related to Australian terrestrial elapids, and the sea kraits (subfamily Laticaudinae), which are related to the Asian cobras. Although their venom is the most potent of all snakes, human fatalities are rare because sea snakes are not aggressive, their venom output is small, and their fangs are very short.
Of the 55 species of true sea snakes, most adults are 1–1.5 metres (3.3–5 feet) long, though some individuals may attain 2.7 metres. They are restricted to coastal areas of the Indian and western Pacific oceans, except for the yellow-bellied sea snake (Pelamis platurus), found in open ocean from Africa eastward across the Pacific to the west coast of the Americas. All other species live mainly in waters less than 30 metres (100 feet) deep, as they must dive to the seafloor to obtain their food among coral reefs, among mangroves, or on the ocean bottom. Some species prefer hard bottoms (corals), while others prefer soft bottoms (mud or sand) in which to hunt their prey. Most sea snakes feed upon fishes of various sizes and shapes, including eels. Two primitive groups (genera Aipysurus and Emydocephalus) eat only fish eggs; Hydrophis specializes in burrowing eels.
