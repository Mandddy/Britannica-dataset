Juan Goytisolo,  (born January 5, 1931, Barcelona, Spain) Spanish novelist, short-story writer, and essayist whose early Neorealist work evolved into avant-garde fiction using structuralist and formalist techniques.
A young child when his mother was killed during the Spanish Civil War, Goytisolo grew up hating the fascist dictatorship and the countryâ€™s conservative religious values. From 1948 to 1952 he attended the universities of Barcelona and Madrid. From the late 1950s he lived in self-imposed exile in Paris and later in Marrakech, Morocco.
