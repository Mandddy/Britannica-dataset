André Schwarz-Bart,  (born May 23, 1928, Metz, France—died Sept. 30, 2006, Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe) French novelist, author of what is regarded as one of the greatest literary works of the post-World War II period: Le Dernier des justes (1959; The Last of the Just).
Schwarz-Bart’s parents, Polish Jews, moved to France in 1924. By 1941, when he was 13, they had been deported and killed by the Nazis. Young Schwarz-Bart, scarcely knowing French, was active in the Resistance movement and later, while working as a marginal labourer, taught himself to read and write French from library books. Le Dernier des justes probes the conscience of Europe during centuries of persecution and genocide of the Jewish people. It retraces the martyrdom of one of the traditional Jewish Lamed Vav Tzaddiqim (“The 36 Just Men”), Ernie Lévy, who, caught in the madness of Nazism, suffers every possible horror. The novel was awarded the Prix Goncourt.
