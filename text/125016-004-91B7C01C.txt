Rosin, also called colophony, or colophonium,  translucent, brittle, friable resin used for varnish and in manufacturing many products. It becomes sticky when warm and has a faint pinelike odour. Gum rosin consists of the residue obtained upon distillation of the oleoresin (a natural fluid) from pine trees (the volatile component is spirit of turpentine); wood rosin, obtained by solvent extraction of the stumps, is usually of a darker colour.
Rosin and its chemical derivatives are used chiefly to make soaps, varnishes, sealing wax, printing inks, driers, sizes for paper, adhesives, binders, soldering fluxes, gloss oils for paints, and pitch for casks. Rosin is also used on bows of violins and other stringed instruments, on the shoes of dancers, and on floors of studios and stages to prevent slipping.
