Jack Kevorkian,  (born May 26, 1928, Pontiac, Michigan, U.S.—died June 3, 2011, Royal Oak, Michigan) American physician who gained international attention through his assistance in the suicides of more than 100 patients, many of whom were terminally ill.
Jack Kevorkian attended the University of Michigan and in 1952 graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School. Early in his professional training, Kevorkian distanced himself from the medical mainstream. As a pathology resident, he lobbied for carrying out medical experiments on death-row inmates at the hour set for their execution, and then giving them lethal injections, which earned him the sobriquet “Dr. Death.” Later he advocated establishing suicide clinics (“obitoria”). In the 1960s and ’70s he worked as a staff pathologist at hospitals in Michigan and southern California; then in 1982 he retired from practice and began to devote full time to his mission: helping patients end their lives.
