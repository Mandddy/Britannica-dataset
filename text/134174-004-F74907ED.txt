Bolesław Prus, pseudonym of Aleksander Głowacki   (born August 20, 1847, Hrubieszów, Poland—died May 19, 1912, Warsaw) Polish journalist, short-story writer, and novelist who was one of the leading figures of the Positivist period in Polish literature following the 1863 January Insurrection against Russian rule.
Born to an impoverished gentry family, Prus was orphaned early in life and struggled unsuccessfully to complete his education. As a young man, he took an active part in the January Insurrection. Throughout much of his life he contributed articles called “chronicles” to daily papers and periodicals; these reveal the talent for detailed observation and lively presentation that was to make his novels and short stories so effective.
