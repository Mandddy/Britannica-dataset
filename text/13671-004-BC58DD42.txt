Abdülaziz, in full Abdülaziz Oglu Mahmud Ii   (born Feb. 9, 1830, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Tur.]—died June 4, 1876, Constantinople) Ottoman sultan (1861–76) who continued the westernizing reforms that had been initiated by his predecessors until 1871, after which his reign took an absolutist turn.
Like his brother Abdülmecid I, whom he succeeded as sultan on June 25, 1861, Abdülaziz was an ardent admirer of the material progress in western Europe. Educated in the Ottoman tradition, however, he could not always accept the adoption of Western institutions and customs. Abdülaziz was a member of the Mawlawiyah (Mevlevi) order of dervishes (Muslim mystics).
