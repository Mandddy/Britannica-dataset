Whitelaw Reid,  (born Oct. 27, 1837, near Xenia, Ohio, U.S.—died  Dec. 15, 1912, London) U.S. journalist, diplomat, and politician, successor to Horace Greeley in 1872 as editor in chief (until 1905) and publisher (until his death) of the New York Tribune, which, during much of that period, was perhaps the most influential newspaper in the United States. He was minister to France from 1889 to 1892, unsuccessful candidate for vice president on the Republican ticket with Benjamin Harrison in 1892, and ambassador to Great Britain from 1905 to 1912.
Early in the American Civil War, Reid served as war correspondent for the Cincinnati Gazette and as aide-de-camp to the Union generals Thomas A. Morris and William S. Rosecrans. From 1862 to 1868 he was Washington (D.C.) correspondent for the Gazette and simultaneously (1863–66) was librarian of the House of Representatives. Hired by Greeley for the Tribune in 1868, he was responsible for the paper’s exceptional coverage of the Franco-German War (1870–71) and secured free-lance contributions from Mark Twain and Bret Harte. Although Reid’s editorial policy was, uncharacteristically for the period, antisensationalist, he became an advocate of U.S. territorial expansion. As one of the peace commissioners at the end of the Spanish–American War, he successfully urged that the United States retain all of the Philippines.
