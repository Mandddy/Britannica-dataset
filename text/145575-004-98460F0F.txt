Sir Alan Gordon Cunningham,  (born May 1, 1887, Dublin, Ire.—died  Jan. 30, 1983, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Eng.) British army officer who scored important victories over Italian forces in eastern Africa during World War II, enabling the exiled emperor Haile Selassie to return to power in Ethiopia.
A commissioned officer from 1906, Cunningham had been promoted to major general by November 1940, when he took command of British troops (recruited mainly from various parts of Africa) in Kenya. Marching north into Italian Somaliland in February 1941, his force showed remarkable mobility despite great geographical and administrative difficulties. After occupying the Red Sea ports of Chisimaio (now Kismaayo) and Mogadiscio (Mogadishu), he pursued the Italians into the mountainous interior, and on April 6, 1941, he entered the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. On May 20, 1941, in cooperation with General Sir William Platt’s army advancing from the north, he received the surrender, at Amba Alagi, of the main Italian armies under Amadeo di Savoia, Duke d’Aosta.
