Chocó, Cariban-speaking Indian people of the Panamanian and Colombian lowlands. The Northern Chocó, the most populous, live in villages along the lower reaches of rivers flowing into the Golfo de San Miguel (in Panama) and the rivers of Colombia’s Pacific coast; the Southern Chocó are concentrated around the Río San José; and the Catio inhabit the eastern portions of the Atrato valley.
Chocó villages consist of round dwellings on piles, usually along rivers. The Chocó practice shifting horticulture, the slash-and-burn pattern common throughout much of tropical America. Unlike most of their neighbours, the Chocó grow only food crops. They also hunt with bow and arrow and with blowgun and poisoned darts.
