Hong Xiuquan, Wade-Giles romanization Hung Hsiu-ch’üan, original name Hong Renkun, literary name (hao) Xiuquan  (born Jan. 1, 1814, Huaxian [now Huadu], Guangdong province, China—died  June 1, 1864, Nanjing) Chinese religious prophet and leader of the Taiping Rebellion (1850–64), during which he declared his own new dynasty, which centred on the captured (1853) city of Nanjing. This great upheaval, in which more than 20,000,000 people are said to have been killed, drastically altered the course of modern Chinese history.
Hong was the youngest son of four children in a poor but proud Hakka family. The Hakkas were an industrious people who had migrated into South China from the north several centuries earlier and still retained their original customs. At an early age, Hong showed signs of great intelligence; his entire village sponsored him in his studies, hoping that he would eventually pass the Confucian civil service examination, enter the government bureaucracy, and bring wealth and honour to his family and friends.
