Josiah Wedgwood,  (baptized July 12, 1730, Burslem [now in Stoke-on-Trent], Staffordshire, Eng.—died Jan. 3, 1795, Etruria, Staffordshire) English pottery designer and manufacturer, outstanding in his scientific approach to pottery making and known for his exhaustive researches into materials, logical deployment of labour, and sense of business organization.
The youngest child of the potter Thomas Wedgwood, Josiah came from a family whose members had been potters since the 17th century. After his father’s death in 1739, he worked in the family business at Churchyard Works, Burslem, becoming exceptionally skillful at the potter’s wheel and, in 1744, an apprentice to his elder brother Thomas. An attack of smallpox seriously curtailed his work; the disease later affected his right leg, which was then amputated. The consequent inactivity, however, enabled him to read, research, and experiment in his craft. After Thomas refused his proposal for partnership about 1749, Josiah, after a brief partnership (1752–53) with John Harrison at Stoke-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, joined in 1754 with Thomas Whieldon of Fenton Low, Staffordshire, probably the leading potter of his day. This became a fruitful partnership, enabling Wedgwood to become a master of current pottery techniques. He then began what he called his “experiment book,” an invaluable source on Staffordshire pottery.
