Gran Paradiso National Park,  park in northwestern Italy, established in 1836 as a hunting zone; in 1856 it became the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso, and by a law passed in August 1947, the park received “autonomous organization” status. The park covers an area of 153,240 ac (62,000 ha) and extends along the upper Valle d’Aosta region at an elevation of about 3,000 to 13,000 ft (1,200 to 4,100 m). The terrain is typically alpine, with numerous glaciers, coniferous tree lined slopes, and alpine meadows and pastures scattered with rocks and scree.
Animal life includes ibex, chamois, ermine (stoat), weasels, hare, and golden eagles. Scientific research work done in the park includes the study of soil, of agricultural and climatological problems affecting the mountain economy of Italy, and of the park’s animal inhabitants.
