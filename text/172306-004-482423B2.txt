Premchand, also spelled Prem Chand, pseudonym of Dhanpat Rai Srivastava   (born July 31, 1880, Lamati, near Varanasi, India—died October 8, 1936, Varanasi) Indian author of novels and short stories in Hindi and Urdu who pioneered in adapting Indian themes to Western literary styles.
Premchand worked as a teacher until 1921, when he joined Mohandas K. Gandhi’s Noncooperation Movement. As a writer, he first gained renown for his Urdu-language novels and short stories. Except in Bengal, the short story had not been an accepted literary form in northern India until Premchand’s works appeared. Though best known for his works in Hindi, Premchand did not achieve complete fluency in that language until his middle years. His first major Hindi novel, Sevasadana (1918; “House of Service”), dealt with the problems of prostitution and moral corruption among the Indian middle class. Premchand’s works depict the social evils of arranged marriages, the abuses of the British bureaucracy, and exploitation of the rural peasantry by moneylenders and officials.
