Janet Frame, in full Janet Paterson Frame Clutha  (born August 28, 1924, Dunedin, New Zealand—died January 29, 2004, Dunedin) leading New Zealand writer of novels, short fiction, and poetry. Her works were noted for their explorations of alienation and isolation.
Frame was born to a railroad worker and a sometime-poet who had been a maid for the family of writer Katherine Mansfield. Her early years were marked by poverty, the drowning death of her sister, and the disruptions created by her brother’s epilepsy. In 1945, while studying to be a teacher, she suffered a breakdown. Misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia, she spent nearly a decade in psychiatric hospitals. From 1947, following the drowning death of another sister, she endured repeated courses of electroconvulsive therapy. During that time she read the classics voraciously and cultivated her writing talent.
