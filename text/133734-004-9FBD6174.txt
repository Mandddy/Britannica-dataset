Juanes, originally Juan Estebán Aristizábal Vásquez  (born August 9, 1972, Medellín, Colombia) Colombian guitarist, singer, songwriter, and activist, who with an absorbing stage presence gained international recognition in the early 21st century for his passionate songs of romantic love and social struggle.
When Juanes was seven years old, his father and brothers taught him to play guitar, and he quickly became immersed in the musical traditions of his Colombian homeland. Later he became infatuated with rock and roll, and for 11 years he was a singer and guitarist for Ekhymosis, a heavy metal band that enjoyed a strong following in his country. Juanes grew restless with the artistic limitations of the band, however, and in 1999 he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a solo career.
