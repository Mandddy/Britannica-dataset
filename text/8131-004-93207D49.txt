West Highland white terrier, breed of terrier that probably originated at Poltalloch, in the former county of Argyll, Scotland. It was bred there for many years by the Malcolm family, whose dogs appear to be traceable back to the time of King James I of England. Typically hardy and gay-spirited, the West Highland white terrier is a short-legged dog standing 10 to 11 inches (25 to 28 cm) and weighing 13 to 19 pounds (6 to 8.5 kg). Its coat is pure white and consists of a soft, furry undercoat overlaid by a straight, hard outer coat. It is thought that the breed is descended from the same ancestral stock as the other Scottish terriers—the Dandie Dinmont, Scottish, and cairn terriers.
