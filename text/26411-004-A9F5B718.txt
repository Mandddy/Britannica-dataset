René Schickele,  (born Aug. 4, 1883, Oberehnheim, Alsace—died  Jan. 31, 1940, Vence, Fr.) German journalist, poet, novelist, and dramatist, whose personal experience of conflict between nations made his work an intense plea for peace and understanding.
Schickele was active as a foreign correspondent, editor, and, from 1915 to 1919, as the publisher of the Weissen Blätter (“The White Papers”), which he had transferred from Berlin to Zürich and which he made the most effective mouthpiece of European anti-war sentiment during World War I.
