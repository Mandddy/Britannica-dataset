Sheepshead, (Archosargus probatocephalus), popular edible sport fish in the family Sparidae (order Perciformes), common in Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters of the southern North American coast. Although once prevalent in the New England to Chesapeake Bay area, the species has inexplicably become very rare.
Sheepshead are characteristically large fish with compressed bodies and high foreheads. The body colour is silver with broad, dark vertical bands that are most distinct in juveniles. The large flat teeth are used for crushing and grinding not only crustaceans but also mollusks such as clams and oysters. Adult sheepshead commonly range in length from 60 to 75 cm (2 to 2 1/2 feet). Some specimens have been known to exceed 1 m (3 feet) and weight more than 11 kg (25 pounds).
