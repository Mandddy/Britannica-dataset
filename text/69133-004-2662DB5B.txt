Lillehammer 1994 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in Lillehammer, Nor., that took place Feb. 12â€“27, 1994. The Lillehammer Games were the 17th occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
After only a two-year interlude, the Olympic Winter Games were held in 1994, when a 1986 amendment to the Olympic Charter calling for the Summer and Winter Games to be held alternately every two years went into effect. Awarded to Lillehammer, the 1994 Olympics were noteworthy for their environmental conservation. While numerous facilities had to be built to accommodate the events, measures were taken to protect the land. Contractors were fined for cutting down too many trees, the hockey rink was set into the side of a mountain to conserve energy, and buildings were constructed with future use in mind.
