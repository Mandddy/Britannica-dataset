Angelfish, any of various unrelated fishes of the order Perciformes. The angelfishes, or scalares, popular in home aquariums are members of the genus Pterophyllum and the cichlid family. They are thin, deep-bodied fishes with elongated dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. Depending on the authority, one to three species may be recognized: P. scalare, P. eimekei, and P. altum. Angelfishes are native to the freshwaters of tropical South America and may grow to a length of about 15 cm (6 inches). They are commonly silvery with vertical dark markings but may be solid or partially black. They are carnivorous and take care of their eggs and young.
The brightly coloured marine angelfishes seen among tropical reefs are members of the family Pomacanthidae. Sometimes placed with the similar butterfly fishes in the family Chaetodontidae, they are compressed, deep-bodied fishes with small mouths and rather rough scales; the largest grows about 46 cm (18 inches) long. These angelfishes are distinguished from the butterfly fishes by a sharp spine on each cheek. These angelfishes feed on algae and various marine invertebrates. The family, which includes fewer than 100 species, is represented in both the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific. In many species, colouring of the young differs greatly from that of adults.
