Pará, estado (state) of northern Brazil through which the lower Amazon River flows to the sea. It is bounded to the north by Guyana, Suriname, and the Brazilian state of Amapá, to the northeast by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by the Brazilian states of Maranhão and Tocantins, to the south by Mato Grosso, and to the west by Amazonas. It is the second largest state in Brazil. The capital and chief city is Belém.
Belém was founded by the Portuguese in 1615, chiefly to keep other European nations from settling there. Spanish Jesuit missions were the first settlements upstream, including Santarém in 1661; they were finally expelled by the Portuguese in 1710. Pará was made a captaincy in 1652, reunited with Maranhão in 1654, and reestablished in 1772. It did not acknowledge the Brazilian empire established in 1822 but yielded to force in 1823. It became a state when the new Brazilian republic was founded in 1889. Between 1850 and 1910 there was a period of feverish economic activity in the state as workers went out into the forests to tap the rubber trees. Rubber in large quantities was shipped out through Belém, and the city grew rapidly in size and importance. Production dropped quickly after 1910, however. A gold rush in the 1980s and large-scale exploitation of natural resources marked the development of the region in the late 20th century.
