Alex Rodriguez, in full Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez, byname A-Rod  (born July 27, 1975, New York City, New York, U.S.) American professional baseball player, a noted power hitter who was considered one of the greatest talents in the history of the sport but whose career was in many ways overshadowed by his use of performance-enhancing drugs.
Rodriguez and his family moved to his fatherâ€™s native Dominican Republic when Alex was four, but they later relocated to Miami, Florida. There he became an excellent ballplayer at Westminster Christian High School, and in 1993 the Seattle Mariners selected Rodriguez as the first overall pick in the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. He made his debut with the Mariners at age 18, playing shortstop.
