Aksel Lund Svindal,  (born December 26, 1982, Løerenskog, Norway) Norwegian Alpine skier who won two men’s Fédération International de Ski (FIS) World Cup overall championships (2007 and 2009), as well as a gold medal in the supergiant slalom (super-G) at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver.
Svindal’s parents, both skiers, bought him his first pair of skis for his third birthday, and by age nine he was racing competitively. He attended high school in Oppdal, Norway, a ski resort that hosted World Cup slalom skiing events, which enabled him to tend to his studies and work on his technique on the slopes at the same time. He won the national under-16 slalom title and was chosen to ski for the Norwegian junior national team. At the FIS junior world ski championships in 2002, Svindal collected four medals, including a gold in the combined event. In March 2005 at Bormio, Italy, he earned his first FIS world ski championship medal—the silver in the combined.
