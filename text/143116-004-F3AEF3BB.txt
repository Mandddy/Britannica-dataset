Kindle, portable wireless electronic reading device produced by the American e-commerce company Amazon.com.
The Kindle was first released by Amazon.com in 2007 as a new way to read books, magazines, newspapers, and other written material. The Kindle uses a display technology called electronic paper, which produces a sharp screen image that resembles text printed on paper. Roughly the size and weight of a trade paperback book, with a 6-inch (15.2-cm) monochromatic screen, the original Kindle could store more than 200 electronic books, or e-books, and could be loaded with new material from Amazon.com through a free wireless connection, though only in the United States. The Kindle was also equipped with a limited World Wide Web browser that let American users access the Internet.
