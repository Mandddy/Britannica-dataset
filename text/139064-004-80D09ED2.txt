William Jefferson Hague, Baron Hague of Richmond,  (born March 26, 1961, Rotherham, Yorkshire, England) British politician who served as leader of the Conservative Party (1997–2001) and as foreign secretary under Prime Minister David Cameron (2010–14).
Hague was born into a family that ran a small soft-drink business. He attended local schools—like John Major, his immediate predecessor as Conservative leader, but unlike most prominent Tories. By age 12 he devoted himself to following politics, and at 16 he spoke to his first Conservative Party conference. The confident attack on the then Labour government by a 16-year-old schoolboy with a pronounced northern accent captivated the media and impressed the Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher.
