Alligator lizard, any of 42 lizard species in the subfamily Gerrhonotinae of the family Anguidae in any of the following genera: Abronia, Barisia, Elgaria, Gerrhonotus, and Mesaspis. Alligator lizards are found from southern British Columbia and the northwestern United States through Mexico and Central America to Panama. Abronia, Barisia, and Mesaspis are largely tropical or subtropical in distribution, whereas Elgaria and Gerrhonotus inhabit the northern temperate zone. Although most alligator lizards appear superficially similar in body structure, some are stout with short tails (Abronia and Barisia), whereas others are more slender with long tails (Elgaria, Gerrhonotus, and Mesaspis). All alligator lizards have rather short limbs. The presence of a fold of skin along the lower edge of the side of the body distinguishes these animals from many other lizards. Large scales provide armour for the head, body, and tail. In addition, alligator lizards possess a chemosensory system keen enough to determine which insects and spiders are edible (that is, free from high levels of toxins).
The largest alligator lizard is the smooth-headed alligator lizard (G. liocephalus), and its body alone can reach 20 cm (8 inches). Although many alligator lizards are dull brown or gray, some are brightly coloured. Copeâ€™s arboreal alligator lizard (A. aurita), for example, is mottled green with scales on the head and neck that are highlighted with yellow and orange. Alligator lizards have powerful jaws and will bite if handled roughly.
