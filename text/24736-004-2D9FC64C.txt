Valentín Gómez Farías,  (born Feb. 14, 1781, Guadalajara, Mex.—died  July 5, 1858, Mexico City) the leader of Mexican liberalism in the mid-19th century, notable for his social reforms of 1833–34, which earned him the enmity of the clergy, the army, and the gentry. After training as a physician, he was influenced by French liberal political ideas and participated in the Mexican struggle for independence during the 1820s. In 1833 he was elected vice president in the administration of Antonio López de Santa Anna.
When Santa Anna left the capital, Gómez Farías, in effective control of the government, immediately obtained legislation that reduced the number of generals, ended the special privileges of the military, and created a civilian militia. Personally devout, he nonetheless favoured a complete separation of church and state but succeeded only in severing church control of education, rescinding the compulsory payment of tithes, and permitting members of religious orders to retract their vows. He also reformed the customhouses and eliminated the tobacco monopoly.
