Angus, formerly Forfarshire,  council area and historic county in eastern Scotland, bounded on the east by the North Sea and on the south by the Firth of Tay. The council area lies entirely within the historic county of Angus, which also includes the city of Dundee and a small area south of Coupar Angus in the Perth and Kinross council area. The chief city of the county is Dundee, which constitutes a separate council area.
Angus is bisected by the Highland Boundary Fault, running northeast-southwest from Edzell to Lintrathen. The Highland area comprises plateaus of 2,000–3,000 feet (600–900 metres) in elevation indented by three broad glens, or valleys (Glen Isla, Glen Clova, and Glen Esk). Glaciation did not heavily erode the uplands except in those valleys; there glaciers excavated ribbon lochs (lakes), such as Loch Lee in Glen Esk, now used as a reservoir. South of the impressive Highland edge lies the rich vale of Strathmore (“the howe of Angus”), which has fertile glacial deposits. The Sidlaw Hills form the southeastern boundary of the vale of Strathmore, and their scarp face looks southeastward over coastal lowlands covered with glacial till. Sand dunes and postglacial raised beaches fringe the shore.
