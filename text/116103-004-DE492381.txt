Kincardineshire, also called Kincardine or the Mearns,  historic county in northeastern Scotland, along the North Sea coast south of Aberdeen. It is part of the Aberdeenshire council area. Kincardine is the southernmost of the historic counties of northeastern Scotland. In ancient times it marked the northern limit of the brief Roman penetration of Scotland. It then formed part of the kingdom of the Picts, which later merged with the kingdom of the Scots. The Scottish kings made a stronghold of the ancient castle of Kincardine, from which the county derived its name. Edward I of England passed through Kincardine in 1296, during the Scottish Wars of Independence. The regalia of the Scottish crown were kept for safekeeping at Dunnottar Castle, south of Stonehaven, during the Commonwealth Wars of the 1650s. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, James Edward, the Old Pretender, visited Fetteresso Castle near Stonehaven and was proclaimed King James VIII by his followers. The valley of the River Dee, in the north of the county, has many buildings of architectural note, including Dunnottar Castle (c. 1392), a number of 17th-century castles, and several ruined churches. Stonehaven is the historic county town (seat) of Kincardineshire.
