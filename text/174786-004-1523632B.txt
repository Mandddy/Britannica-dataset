Detour, American low-budget crime drama that was virtually ignored upon its initial release in 1945 but was later championed by film critics and such directors as Martin Scorsese as one of the high points of the film noir genre.
Al Roberts (played by Tom Neal) is a hitchhiker who assumes a benefactorâ€™s identity when the man dies during their cross-country ride. He soon finds himself forced to continue the ploy by a scheming femme fatale (Ann Savage) who wants Roberts to try to claim an inheritance owed to the dead man.
