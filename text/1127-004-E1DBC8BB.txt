Hannibal Hamlin,  (born Aug. 27, 1809, Paris Hill, Maine, U.S.—died  July 4, 1891, Bangor, Maine) 15th vice president of the United States (1861–65) in the Republican administration of President Abraham Lincoln.
Hamlin was the son of Cyrus Hamlin, a physician, sheriff, and farmer, and Anna Livermore. After practicing law, he entered politics as an antislavery Jacksonian Democrat and served in the Maine state legislature (1836–40). He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1842 and to the Senate in 1848. In his first term as a senator, he took an antislavery position on sectional issues and left the Democratic Party in 1856 because of its endorsement of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which proponents of abolitionism had attacked as a capitulation to the interests of the slave states. He was elected Maine’s first Republican governor (1856) but resigned in February 1857 to return to the Senate.
