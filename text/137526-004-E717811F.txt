Rock cress (genus Arabis), genus of some 120 species of herbs belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae), found throughout the Northern Hemisphere and in mountainous areas of Africa. Rock cresses are often erect or mound-forming and bear characteristic long, narrow seedpods, called siliques. Some species are cultivated as ornamentals for their attractive white, pink, or purple four-petaled flowers.
Wall rock cress, or garden arabis (Arabis caucasica), is a perennial from southeastern Europe. It reaches 30 cm (1 foot) in height and bears fragrant white flowers in early spring; it has double, pink, dwarf, and variegated varieties. Alpine rock cress (A. alpina) also produces white flowers and is common in rock gardens. The bluish rock cress (A. caerulea) is an alpine perennial only 10 cm (4 inches) tall, with pale purple flowers. Many North American rock cress species have been reassigned to the genus Boechera.
