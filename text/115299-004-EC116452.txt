Grenville Mellen Dodge,  (born April 12, 1831, Danvers, Mass., U.S.â€”died  Jan. 3, 1916, Council Bluffs, Iowa) American civil engineer who was responsible for much of the railroad construction in the western and southwestern United States during the 19th century.
Educated at Durham (N.H.) Academy and Norwich (Vt.) University, Dodge graduated as a military and civil engineer in 1851, just when railroad building was beginning in the United States on a large scale. During the American Civil War he was promoted rapidly to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers and provided valuable service in bridge and railroad construction. For example, he built a bridge 14 feet (4 m) high and 710 feet (216 m) long across the Chattahoochee River in only three days.
