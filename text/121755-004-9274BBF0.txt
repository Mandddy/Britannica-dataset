The University of Washington was established in 1861 and is the oldest state-supported university on the U.S. West Coast. Its early years were marked by unreliable funding and periods of suspended operations. By the 1890s, however, the university’s financial support was stabilized, and it began to prosper. The School of Law and the Graduate School were both founded in 1899. The Bothell and Tacoma campuses opened in 1990. Several Nobel Prize-winning medical researchers, physicists, and economists have been faculty members of the University of Washington.
