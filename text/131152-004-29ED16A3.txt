Apple scab, disease of apple trees caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis, producing dark blotches or lesions on the leaves, fruit, and sometimes young twigs. Infections in young leaves often cause leaf deformities. Affected plants may drop their fruit prematurely, resulting in potentially high crop losses. Apple scab is found wherever apples are grown but is most severe where spring and summer are cool and moist. All apple species are affected, though some cultivars have greater resistance. Regular spraying with fungicides is the most effective method of controlling the disease.
