William Kelly,  (born Aug. 21, 1811, Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.â€”died  Feb. 11, 1888, Louisville, Ky.) American ironmaster who invented the pneumatic process of steelmaking, in which air is blown through molten pig iron to oxidize and remove unwanted impurities. Also patented by Sir Henry Bessemer of Great Britain, this process produced the first inexpensive steel, which became the major construction material in the burgeoning industrial age.
In the early 1840s, while on a buying trip for McShane &amp; Kelly, a Pittsburgh dry-goods and shipping company in which he was a partner, Kelly became interested in the iron industry around Eddyville, Ky., and later persuaded his brother to join him in forming an ironworks. They bought an iron furnace and 14,000 acres of timberland and ore deposits; the Eddyville Iron Works prospered.
