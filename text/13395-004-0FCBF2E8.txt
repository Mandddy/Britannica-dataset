Ardashīr I,  (flourished 3rd century) the founder of the Sāsānian empire in ancient Persia (reigned ad 224–241).
Ardashīr was the son of Bābak, who was the son or descendant of Sāsān and was a vassal of the chief petty king in Persis, Gochihr. After Bābak got Ardashīr the military post of argabad in the town of Dārābgerd (near modern Darab, Iran), Ardashīr extended his control over several neighbouring cities. Meanwhile, Bābak had slain Gochihr and taken the title of king. Although Bābak’s request that the Parthian king Artabanus V allow him to transmit the crown to his eldest son, Shāpūr, was refused, Shāpūr nevertheless succeeded him. In the ensuing struggle between him and Ardashīr, Shāpūr was killed, and Ardashīr was crowned king of Persis in 208. Having suppressed a revolt in Dārābgerd, he gradually conquered the neighbouring province of Kermān and the coastal Persian Gulf lands. He made his capital at Gūr (modern Fīrūzābād), which he renamed Ardashīr-Kwarrah.
