Pierre d’Ailly,  (born 1350, Compiègne, France—died  Aug. 9, 1420, Avignon) French theologian, cardinal, and advocate of church reform whose chief aim was to heal the Great Schism of the Western church (1378–1417). He advocated the doctrine of conciliarism—the subordination of the pope to a general council—and in 1381 he suggested convoking such a council in an effort to end the schism.
D’Ailly studied at the College of Navarre of the University of Paris, where he became a doctor of theology (1380). He became master of the college in 1384 and later was made chancellor of the university and the king’s confessor and almoner (1389). He displeased the university, however, by supporting the antipope Benedict XIII, who appointed him bishop of Le Puy (1395) and then bishop of Cambrai (1397). He gradually broke with Benedict, who, with the Roman pope Boniface IX, refused to abdicate to heal the schism. D’Ailly then returned to his earlier conciliar doctrine, which steadily became more extreme.
