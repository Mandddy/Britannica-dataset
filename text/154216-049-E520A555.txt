James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), U.S.–European Space Agency–Canadian satellite observatory proposed as the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and scheduled to be launched by an Ariane 5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest. The JWST will have a mirror 6.5 metres (21.3 feet) in diameter, seven times larger than that of the HST, and will orbit the Sun in a Lissajous pattern around the second Lagrangian point, about 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) from Earth on the planet’s nightside. The telescope is designed primarily to detect light in the infrared in order to observe sources such as the first galaxies and protostars that radiate at those wavelengths. Since infrared satellite observatories must be protected from thermal radiation, a sun shield about 150 square metres (1,600 square feet) in area will be deployed to protect the telescope. Since there is no rocket wide enough to hold the JWST, both the sun shield and the mirror will be launched folded and will unfold when the telescope reaches its proper orbit.
