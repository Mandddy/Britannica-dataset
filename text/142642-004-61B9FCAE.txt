Irish Sea, Irish Muir Éireann,  arm of the North Atlantic Ocean that separates Ireland from Great Britain. The Irish Sea is bounded by Scotland on the north, England on the east, Wales on the south, and Ireland on the west. The sea is connected with the Atlantic by the North Channel between Northern Ireland and Scotland and by St. George’s Channel between the southeastern tip of Ireland and southwestern Wales. The sea is about 130 miles (210 km) long and 150 miles (240 km) wide. Its total area is approximately 40,000 square miles (100,000 square km). Its greatest depth measures about 576 feet (175 m) at the Mull of Galloway, near the sea’s junction with the North Channel. In classical times the Irish Sea was known as Oceanus Hibernicus.
There are two principal islands in the Irish Sea. The Isle of Man lies in the centre of the northern part, and Anglesey lies close to the coast of North Wales. Geologic studies seem to indicate that the Irish Sea originated by rifting during the Paleogene and Neogene periods (about 65 to 2.6 million years ago), and subsidence of its basins was probably initiated or renewed at that time.
