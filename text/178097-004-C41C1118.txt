Quito, in full Villa de San Francisco de Quito,  city and capital of Ecuador. It is situated on the lower slopes of the volcano Pichincha, which last erupted in 1666, in a narrow Andean valley at an elevation of 9,350 feet (2,850 metres), just south of the Equator. The oldest of all South American capitals, Quito is notable for its well-preserved old town, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978.
The area was a market centre and political frontier before its conquest by the Inca empire, which led to its fortification as an Inca settlement. Sebastián de Belalcázar, a lieutenant of the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro, occupied the city on December 6, 1534, and declared a municipal government (cabildo). (Founder’s Day, December 6, is marked with a weeklong celebration.) Quito remained the focal point of national affairs—political, social, and economic—until the early 20th century, when economic dominance shifted to Guayaquil. A distinct rivalry between the two cities still exists, with Quito remaining the country’s political and cultural centre.
