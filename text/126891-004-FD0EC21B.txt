Harper Lee, in full Nelle Harper Lee  (born April 28, 1926, Monroeville, Alabama, U.S.â€”died February 19, 2016, Monroeville) American writer nationally acclaimed for her novel To Kill a Mockingbird (1960).
Harper Lee is the daughter of Amasa Coleman Lee, a lawyer who was by all accounts apparently rather like the hero-father of her novel in his sound citizenship and warmheartedness. The plot of To Kill a Mockingbird is based in part on his unsuccessful youthful defense of two African American men convicted of murder.
