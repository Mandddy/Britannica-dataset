Cindy Crawford, in full Cynthia Ann Crawford  (born Feb. 20, 1966, DeKalb, Ill., U.S.) American fashion model best known as a face of the cosmetics company Revlon.
Crawford grew up in DeKalb, Ill., near Chicago, where her father worked as an electrician and her mother was employed as a bank teller. In 1982, while working during the summer detasseling corn on a nearby farm, she was spotted and photographed by a local news photographer. The following year she entered the Look of the Year modeling contest (later renamed Elite Model Look) held by Elite Model Management, one of the largest modeling agencies in the world. Her status as a finalist secured her professional representation, which quickly generated modeling assignments. In 1984 Crawford graduated as class valedictorian from DeKalb High School and began pursuing a degree in chemical engineering at Northwestern University on an academic scholarship. She found it increasingly difficult, however, to juggle school and modeling, and in 1985 she dropped out of college to model full time.
