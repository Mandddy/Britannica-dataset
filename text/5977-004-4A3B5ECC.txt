Aspleniaceae, the spleenwort family of ferns, with 1–10 genera and some 800 species, in the division Pteridophyta (the lower vascular plants). Some botanists treat Aspleniaceae as comprising a single genus, Asplenium (spleenwort), but up to nine small segregate genera are recognized by other botanists.
The genera (or subgenera) in the family include Camptosorus (walking fern), Ceterach (scaly spleenworts), Hymenasplenium (flat-stemmed spleenworts), Neottopteris (bird’s nest ferns), and Phyllitis (hart’s tongue fern). Most species in the family are characterized by sporangia in lines along the veins, usually covered by a narrow membranous flap of tissue (indusium) attached along the vein and protecting the developing sporangia. The spores are mostly bean-shaped (bilateral). A number of species in the family, particularly the bird’s nest ferns, are popular as houseplants and in greenhouses.
