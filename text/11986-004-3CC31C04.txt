Peter Carl Fabergé, original name Karl Gustavovich Fabergé   (born May 18 [May 30, New Style], 1846, St. Petersburg, Russia—died September 24, 1920, Lausanne, Switzerland) one of the greatest goldsmiths, jewelers, and designers in Western decorative arts and jeweler to the Russian imperial court.
Of Huguenot descent and a son of a St. Petersburg jeweler, Fabergé was trained in St. Petersburg, Frankfurt, and Dresden, and he absorbed influences across western Europe with travels to Paris and London. He inherited his father’s business in 1870 and continued to manufacture jewelry and decorative objects while expanding the firm’s concentration to include furniture, functional objects, and, famously, objects of fancy.
