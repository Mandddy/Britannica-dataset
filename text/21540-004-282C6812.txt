Eleanor Medill Patterson, original name Elinor Josephine Patterson, byname Cissy Patterson  (born November 7, 1881, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died July 24, 1948, Marlboro, Maryland) the flamboyant editor and publisher of the Washington Times-Herald.
Elinor Patterson came from one of the great American newspaper families: her grandfather, Joseph Medill, had been editor in chief of the Chicago Tribune; her father, Robert W. Patterson, and her cousin, Robert R. McCormick, were in turn editors and publishers of the Tribune; and her brother, Joseph Medill Patterson, was publisher of the New York Daily News. After a private education at Miss Hersey’s School in Boston and Miss Porter’s School in Farmington, Connecticut, she married a Polish nobleman, Count Joseph Gizycki, in 1904; the count had other interests besides his wife, however, and she left him after less than four years. He followed Patterson, abducted their baby daughter, and initiated enough scandal and intrigue to raise eyebrows on both sides of the Atlantic. It took a year to get the baby back and another eight years for Patterson to obtain a divorce. As Eleanor M. Gizycka she later published two novels, Glass Houses (1926) and Fall Flight (1928). Another marriage left her a widow in 1929.
