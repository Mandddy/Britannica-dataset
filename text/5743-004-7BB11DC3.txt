Battle of Antietam, also called Battle of Sharpsburg,  (September 17, 1862), a decisive engagement in the American Civil War (1861–65) that halted the Confederate advance on Maryland for the purpose of gaining military supplies. The advance was also regarded as one of the greatest Confederate threats to Washington, D.C. The battle took its name from Antietam Creek, which flows south from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to the Potomac River near Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. 
Following the Union defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run, Confederate General Robert E. Lee advanced into Maryland with some hope of capturing the Federal capital of Washington to the southeast. On September 17, 1862, his forces were met at Antietam by the reorganized Federal army under General George B. McClellan, who blocked Lee’s advances but allowed him to retire to Virginia. Most military historians have strongly criticized McClellan’s conduct of the battle, which proved to be one of the bloodiest single days of the war. The South lost 13,724 troops and the North suffered casualties of 12,410.
