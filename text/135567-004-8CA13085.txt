William Pinkney,  (born March 17, 1764, Annapolis, Md.—died  Feb. 25, 1822, Washington, D.C.) U.S. statesman and diplomat, considered one of the foremost lawyers of his day.
A member of the Maryland convention that ratified the federal Constitution in 1788, Pinkney himself voted against ratification. He served in the Maryland state legislature (1788–92; 1795) and on the state’s Executive Council (1792–95). From 1796 to 1804 he represented the United States as a commissioner to negotiate an agreement with Great Britain concerning American maritime losses, and he served as U.S. minister to Great Britain from 1807 to 1811.
