Broomrape (genus Orobanche), any member of about 150 species of the genus Orobanche (family Orobanchaceae, order Lamiales). All are parasitic annual or perennial herbs that produce little chlorophyll; instead, they draw nourishment from the roots of other plants by means of small suckers. Most species are primarily subterranean and appear aboveground only to reproduce. The flowers are irregularly shaped and produce single-chambered capsules that contain numerous minute seeds. The plants have scales in place of leaves and may be yellowish, brownish, purplish, or white in colour.
A number of broomrape species are serious agricultural threats. O. ramosa (hemp broomrape) is a noxious pest around the world and can cause significant losses if crops are heavily infested. Especially common in tomatoes, hemp broomrape can parasitize a variety of vegetable crops, and its tiny seeds are usually spread by contaminated soil or crop seeds. As the broomrape seeds are long-lived and difficult to detect, infested fields are usually quarantined to prevent further spread.
