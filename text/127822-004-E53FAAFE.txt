Rugby League World Cup, international rugby event that is considered to be the foremost competition in the “league” variant of the sport.
The Rugby League World Cup began in 1954 in France and has been held at irregular intervals since then. Australia won six consecutive World Cups between 1975 and 2000, establishing itself as the international powerhouse in rugby league. Australia’s run of dominance ended in 2008 when the team—playing at home in Brisbane—was beaten in the World Cup final by rival New Zealand in one of the biggest upsets in rugby history. The rugby league 2000 World Cup, held in Britain, featured teams from 16 countries, but the 2008 iteration returned to a 10-team format.
