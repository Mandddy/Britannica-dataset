Vanadinite,  vanadium mineral in the pyromorphite series of the apatite group of phosphates, lead chloride vanadate, Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is a source of vanadium and a minor source of lead. The mineralâ€™s typical occurrences are as orange, red, or brown hairlike or barrel-shaped crystals in the oxidized zone of lead deposits as in the Urals, Russia; Transvaal, S.Af.; Chihuahua, Mex.; and Arizona, U.S. Endlichite is a highly arsenious variety; the complete substitution of arsenic for vanadium in the crystal structure forms the mineral mimetite. For detailed physical properties, see vanadate mineral (table).
