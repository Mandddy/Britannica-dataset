Beau Geste, American action-adventure film, released in 1939, that was based on the 1924 novel of the same name by Percival C. Wren. Its acclaimed cast featured four future winners of Academy Awards for best actor or actress: Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Susan Hayward, and Broderick Crawford.
The tale involves three adventuresome British brothers orphaned at an early age and later raised by their aristocratic aunt, Lady Brandon, whose ward is the beautiful Isobel (played by Hayward). When the family attempts to earn some much-needed money by selling their prized possession, the precious "Blue Water" sapphire, the gem suddenly disappears. Beau Geste (Cooper) leaves a note confessing to the theft and then abruptly departs England, joining the French Foreign Legion in North Africa. His brothers, Digby (Robert Preston) and John (Milland), soon join him. All three must contend with the tyrannical Sergeant Markoff (Brian Donlevy), who, after learning about the missing sapphire, terrorizes them in the hope of finding it himself. In the end John is the sole survivor of both the war and Markoffâ€™s brutality, and he returns home with the mystery solved: the missing gem was actually a worthless fake, stolen by Beau to protect his aunt, who had secretly sold the real gem years earlier in order to raise money for the family.
