Charles Frederick Worth,  (born Oct. 13, 1825, Bourne, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  March 10, 1895, Paris, France) pioneer fashion designer and one of the founders of Parisian haute couture.
In 1845 Worth left London, where he had worked in a yard-goods firm, for Paris, where he was employed in a dress accessories shop. His timing was propitious, as the creation of the Second Empire (1852) ushered in a new era of prosperity. With the reinvigoration of Parisian political and intellectual life, Worth established his own ladies’ tailor shop in 1858. Through Princess Metternich, wife of the Austrian ambassador to France (see Klemens, Fürst von Metternich), he gained the patronage of the fashionable empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III of France.
