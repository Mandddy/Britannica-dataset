Vending machine,  coin-actuated machine through which various goods may be retailed. Vending machines should not be confused with coin-operated amusement games or music machines. The first known commercial use of vending machines came early in the 18th century in England, where coin-actuated “honour boxes” were used to sell snuff and tobacco. These devices were also in use in the British-American colonies later in the century.
The first practical, commercial use of vending machines took place in the United States in 1888, when machines were used to expand the sales of chewing gum into places where gum sales otherwise could not be made, specifically the platforms of the New York City elevated railway. The American industry was limited mainly to penny-candy vending until 1926, when the modern era of automatic selling opened with the appearance of cigarette vending machines. The first soft-drink machine followed in 1937.
