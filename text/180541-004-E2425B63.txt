Lawrence Dale Bell,  (born April 5, 1894, Mentone, Ind., U.S.â€”died  Oct. 20, 1956, Buffalo) U.S. aircraft designer whose experimental X-1 rocket-propelled airplane in 1947 was the first to break the sound barrier in level flight.
In 1912 Bell entered the aviation business as a mechanic for his brother, Grover. When his brother was killed in an airplane accident in 1913, Bell decided to quit, but the attraction of flying proved too great. He went to work for another aviation pioneer, Glenn L. Martin, remaining in the field for the rest of his life. He was actively running Bell Aircraft Corporation, Buffalo, at the time of his death. The Bell P-39 Airacobra and the P-63 Kingcobra fighters were widely used in World War II. Bell designed the first U.S. jet aircraft, the P-59A Airacomet fighter. Originally powered by two British Whittle engines, it made its first flight on Oct. 1, 1942.
