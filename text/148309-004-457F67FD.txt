Gin rummy, card game of the rummy family that became an American fad in the 1940s.
Two play, using a 52-card deck; each player is dealt 10 cards facedown, one at a time, beginning with the nondealer. The remainder of the deck, placed facedown, forms the stock, the top card of which is turned up beside it to start the discard pile. The nondealer may take the top card from the discard pile or refuse it; if the nondealer refuses, the dealer has the same option. If both refuse, the nondealer draws the top card of the stock. Thereafter, each player in turn takes the top card of either the discard pile or the stock and then discards one card faceup on the discard pile.
