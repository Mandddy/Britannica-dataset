Bull snake (Pituophis catenifer), North American constrictor snake of the family Colubridae. These snakes are called bull snakes over much of their range; however, in the western United States they are often called gopher snakes. Bull snakes are rather heavy-bodied, small-headed, and may reach 2.5 metres (8 feet) in length. Typical coloration is yellowish brown or creamy, with dark blotches. The nose shield is enlarged for digging. They are related to pine snakes (P. melanoleucus) of the eastern and southern United States and the Mexican bull snake (P. deppei) of north central and western Mexico.
Bull snakes can be found in sandy, open country and in pine barrens, where they eat mainly rodents but also prey on birds and lizards. In defense they hiss loudly and thrash about while vibrating their tail. Bull snakes are therefore frequently mistaken for rattlesnakes. Bull snakes may bite, but they are not venomous. They are egg-layers.
