Thomas Mapfumo,  (born 1945, Marondera, Southern Rhodesia [now in Zimbabwe]) Zimbabwean musician and composer who propelled Zimbabwe toward independence in the 1970s through his cultivation of chimurengaâ€”a local genre of politically charged popular music. Mapfumo also was instrumental in introducing the West to the traditional music of Zimbabwe through his involvement in the world music movement.
When he was still a child, Mapfumo moved from Marondera to Salisbury (now Harare), where he began his musical career at age 16 with a band called the Cyclones. His early career with such bands as the Springfields and the Cosmic Dots featured little more than a few cover versions of Elvis Presley and Otis Redding tunes. During the early 1970s, however, when many black Zimbabweans were beginning to resist the white minority government, Mapfumo was also effecting a revolution in popular music by writing the lyrics to his songs in the language of the Shona people, who constitute the majority of black Zimbabweans, and by incorporating traditional melodies and rhythms into his music.
