Tarim River, Chinese (Pinyin) Talimu He or (Wade-Giles romanization) T’a-li-mu Ho,  chief river of the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, extreme northwestern China. It lies immediately north of the Plateau of Tibet. The river gives its name to the great basin between the Tien Shan and Kunlun mountain systems of Central Asia. It flows for most of its length through the Takla Makan Desert. The word tarim is used to designate the bank of a river that flows into a lake or that is undifferentiable from the sands of a desert. This is a characteristic hydrographic feature of many rivers that traverse the sands of the Takla Makan Desert. Another characteristic of the rivers of the Tarim Basin, including the Tarim itself, is their active migration—i.e., the shifting of their beds and banks.
The Tarim is formed by the confluence of the Kaxgar (Kashgar) and Yarkand (Yarkant) rivers in the far west; flowing northeastward from this confluence, the river is then joined some 230 miles (370 km) downstream by the Aksu and the Hotan (Khotan) rivers. Only the Aksu River flows for the entire year. It is the Tarim’s most important tributary, supplying 70–80 percent of its water volume. The name Tarim is used below the Hotan River confluence. The Tarim once reached Lop Nur, a large saline lake in eastern Xinjiang. However, reservoirs and irrigation works built along its middle course in the mid-20th century have diverted much of its waters. By the 1970s the combination of this water loss and the intense evaporation produced by the region’s dry climate had dried up the Tarim’s lower course, and Lop Nur had become a vast salt-encrusted lake bed. The Tarim also once fed Lake Taitema, located about 100 miles (160 km) southwest of Lop Nur, but the Daxihaizi dam and reservoir project built in the 1970s dried up the river downstream and the lake; the central government has had some success in restoring the river’s flow below the reservoir.
