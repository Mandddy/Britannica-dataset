Malcolm Gladwell,  (born September 3, 1963, London, England) Canadian journalist and writer, best known for his unique perspective on popular culture. He adeptly treaded the boundary between popularizer and intellectual.
Gladwellâ€™s family moved in 1969 from England to Elmira, Ontario, where his father taught at the nearby University of Waterloo and his mother practiced psychotherapy. Gladwell was unique in the agrarian surroundings of Elmira, a largely Mennonite area: his mother was Jamaican and his father was a white Englishman. He later cited the singular perspective afforded by his heritage as a motivating factor in what he called his intellectual adventuring. As a teen, he immersed himself in conservative politics: he idolized American pundit William F. Buckley, and during his time at Trinity College, University of Ontario, he displayed a poster of U.S. Pres. Ronald Reagan on his wall.
