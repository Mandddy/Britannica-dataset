Ferdinand-Édouard Buisson,  (born Dec. 20, 1841, Paris, France—died  Feb. 16, 1932, Thieuloy-Saint-Antoine) French educator who reorganized the French primary school system and who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1927 jointly with the German pacifist Ludwig Quidde.
Refusing to take the teacher’s oath of loyalty to the French Second Empire of Napoleon III, Buisson went to Switzerland, teaching philosophy at Neuchâtel from 1866 to 1870. In 1867 he took part in the first Geneva peace conference, where he advocated a United States of Europe. After the fall of Paris in the Franco-German War of 1870–71, he organized an asylum for war orphans.
