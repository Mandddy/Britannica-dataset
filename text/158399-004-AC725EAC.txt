Goblin shark, rare species of shark belonging to the family Mitsukurinidae (order Lamniformes). Only one extant species (Mitsukurina owstoni) is known, on the basis of a few specimens, although fossils of extinct species have been found. The goblin shark is closely related to the sand shark. Although captured sporadically worldwide, most specimens have been taken from deep marine waters near Japan. They have a long, protruding forehead spike, protruding teeth, and an extended tail similar to that of the thresher sharks (genus Alopias), to which they are also related. Lengths of 3.4 metres (11 feet) have been recorded.
