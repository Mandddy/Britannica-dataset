Transsexuality, variant of gender identity in which the affected person believes that he or she should belong to the opposite sex. The transsexual male, for example, was born with normal female genitalia and other secondary characteristics of the feminine sex; very early in life, however, he identified with men and behaved in a manner appropriate to the male sex. His sexual orientation is generally one of attraction to other females.
With the development of successful surgical techniques and hormone therapy, several thousand transsexuals, male and female, have undergone a permanent gender reassignment. Although both male and female transsexuals exist, the male-to-female operation is more common because the genital reconstruction is more satisfactory. The male-to-female transsexualâ€™s penis and testes are removed, and an artificial vagina is created; breast implants may be inserted, although some breast development usually is promoted with the use of feminizing hormones. Female-to-male transsexuals may undergo mastectomy and hormone treatments to produce the male secondary sexual characteristics, but attempts to create an artificial penis have not been particularly satisfactory.
