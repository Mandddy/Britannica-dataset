Tetra, any of numerous attractively coloured freshwater fishes of the characin family, Characidae, often kept in home aquariums. Tetras are characteristically small, lively, hardy, and unaggressive. They are native to South America and Africa. Tetras are egg layers and breed, as do most other characins, by scattering their eggs among aquatic plants. The name tetra was derived from a genus name, Tetragonopterus, once applied to a large number of characins. The tetras found in pet shops are now placed in several genera, such as Hemigrammus, Hyphessobrycon, and Mimagoniates, but the term tetra, though of no scientific significance, continues as a convenient popular name. Well-known species of tetras include the following:
The black tetra (Gymnocorymbus ternetzi), also called blackamoor, or petticoat fish, is a deep-bodied fish that is 4–7.5 cm (1.5–3 inches) long. When small, it is marked with black on its hind parts and dorsal and anal fins; the black fades to gray as the fish increases in size.
