Murugan, chief deity of the ancient Tamils of South India, son of the warrior goddess Korravai. He was later identified in part with the North Indian war god Skanda. His favourite weapon was the trident or spear, and his banner carried the emblem of a wild fowl. The Tirumurukarruppatai, a “guide to the worship of the god Murugan,” is a description of the chief shrines of the god that the worshiper is encouraged to visit; it was probably written prior to the 7th century ce.
