Robert Zemeckis, in full Robert Lee Zemeckis  (born May 14, 1952, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American director and screenwriter known for crowd-pleasing films that often made innovative use of special effects.
Zemeckis studied filmmaking at the University of Southern California (B.A., 1973), where he met fellow student Robert Gale, who would become his longtime screenwriting partner. Even before Zemeckis graduated, his work caught the eye of famed American director Steven Spielberg, who produced Zemeckis and Galeâ€™s first full-length film, I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978). Zemeckis directed the comedy about three young girls who are obsessed with the Beatles. Zemeckis and Gale subsequently scripted the Spielberg-directed 1941 (1979), and Spielberg served as executive producer for several other films that Zemeckis directed, including his next effort, Used Cars (1980).
