Emma-ō, in Japanese Buddhist mythology, the overlord of hell (Jigoku), corresponding to the Indian deity Yama. He judges the souls of men, while his sister judges the souls of women. The sinner is sent to one of the 16 regions of fire or ice assigned him by Emma-ō for a fixed period of time until the next rebirth, unless saved by the prayers of the living, in which case he is reborn either on earth or in a heavenly paradise. Emma-ō is usually represented with a fierce expression, wearing a Chinese judge’s cap and holding his mace of office.
