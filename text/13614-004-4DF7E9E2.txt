Agostino Di Duccio,  (born 1418, Florence—died  1481?, Perugia, Papal States) early Renaissance sculptor whose work is characterized by its linear decorativeness. His early work shows the influence of Donatello and Michelozzo, whom he assisted in adorning SS. Annunziata in Florence.
Agostino’s name is associated mainly with the wealth of sculptured decoration for the Tempio Malatestiano at Rimini, a building designed by L.B. Alberti. The only work in the Tempio with which he can certainly be associated is the Arca degli Antenati, and it is likely that his share was limited to the sculptures in the chapels of S. Sigismondo, the Sibyls, and the Infant Games and to some decorative carvings. Whether or not he also carved the much-superior reliefs in the chapels of the Planets and the Liberal Arts, he was profoundly influenced by the Neo-Attic style on which these were based. Agostino’s other major work was the series of reliefs he executed for the facade of the Oratory of S. Bernardino at Perugia (c. 1457–61). His style—with its linear emphasis, cursive drapery, and flat, schematic forms—lacks the fundamentally naturalistic intention of most Florentine sculpture of his time and owes its mannerisms largely to the Humanist environment of Rimini.
