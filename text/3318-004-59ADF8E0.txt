East China Sea, Chinese (Wade-Giles) Tung Hai or (Pinyin) Dong Hai,  arm of the Pacific Ocean bordering the East Asian mainland and extending northeastward from the South China Sea, to which it is connected by the shallow Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and mainland China. The East China Sea and the South China Sea together form the China Sea. The East China Sea extends to the east to the chain of the Ryukyu Islands; north to Kyushu, which is the southernmost of Japan’s main islands; northwest to Cheju Island off South Korea; and hence west to China. This northern boundary, roughly a line from Cheju Island to the mouth of the Yangtze River (Chiang Jiang) on China’s eastern coast, separates the East China Sea from the Yellow Sea.
The East China Sea has an area of about 290,000 square miles (750,000 square km) and is largely shallow; almost three-fourths of the sea is less than 650 feet (200 metres), and its average depth is only 1,145 feet (350 metres). Extending alongside the Ryukyu Islands is the deeper part, the Okinawa Trough, with a large section more than 3,300 feet (1,000 metres) deep and a maximum depth of 8,912 feet (2,716 metres). The western edge of the sea is a continuation of the shelf that extends between the South China Sea and the Yellow Sea. A large number of islands and shoals dot the eastern boundary as well as the area near the Chinese mainland.
