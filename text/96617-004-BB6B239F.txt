Cassini-Huygens, U.S.-European space mission to Saturn, launched on October 15, 1997. The mission consisted of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Cassini orbiter, which was the first space probe to orbit Saturn, and the European Space Agency’s Huygens probe, which landed on Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. Cassini was named for the French astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini, who discovered four of Saturn’s moons and the Cassini division, a large gap in Saturn’s rings. Huygens was named for the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Saturn’s rings and Titan.
Cassini-Huygens was one of the largest interplanetary spacecraft. The Cassini orbiter weighs 2,125 kg (4,685 pounds) and is 6.7 metres (22 feet) long and 4 metres (13 feet) wide. The instruments on board Cassini include radar to map the cloud-covered surface of Titan and a magnetometer to study Saturn’s magnetic field. The disk-shaped Huygens probe was mounted on the side of Cassini. It weighed 349 kg (769 pounds), was 2.7 metres (8.9 feet) across, and carried six instruments designed to study the atmosphere and surface of Titan.
