Alonso Berruguete,  (born c. 1488, Paredes de Nava, Castile [now in Palencia, Spain]—died  1561, Toledo, Castile) the most important Spanish sculptor of the Renaissance, known for his intensely emotional Mannerist sculptures of figures portrayed in spiritual torment or in transports of religious ecstasy.
After studying under his father, the painter Pedro Berruguete, Alonso went to Italy (c. 1504/08). Most of his sojourn was spent in Florence and Rome, where he was influenced by the works of Michelangelo and such examples of Hellenistic sculpture in the Vatican collections as the Laocoön. Berruguete’s painting of Salome (Uffizi Gallery, Florence) suggests that his Italian paintings were in the early Mannerist style of Jacopo da Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino.
