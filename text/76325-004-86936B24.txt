Serena Williams,  (born September 26, 1981, Saginaw, Michigan, U.S.) American tennis player who—along with her sister Venus—revolutionized women’s tennis with her powerful style of play, becoming one of the game’s most dominant athletes in the early 21st century.
Williams learned tennis from her father on the public courts in Los Angeles and turned professional in 1995, one year after Venus. Possessing powerful serves and ground strokes and superb athleticism, the sisters soon attracted much attention. Many predicted Venus would be the first Williams sister to win a Grand Slam singles title, but it was Serena who accomplished the feat, winning the 1999 U.S. Open.
