John Horne Tooke, original name John Horne   (born June 25, 1736, London, Eng.â€”died  March 18, 1812, Wimbledon, Surrey) radical politician, one of the most effective English agitators for parliamentary reform and freedom of dissent in the late 18th century. He attacked the powerful Whig magnates but stopped short of advocating democracy.
Born John Horne, the son of a poultry dealer, he assumed (1782) the additional surname Tooke to honour his friend and benefactor William Tooke. He graduated from the University of Cambridge and, in 1760, became a vicar. In 1769 he helped the embattled radical John Wilkes found the Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights, but two years later he broke with Wilkes and created his own Constitutional Society to agitate for parliamentary reform and self-government for the American colonies.
