Charlton Heston, original name John Charles Carter  (born October 4, 1923, Evanston, Illinois, U.S.—died April 5, 2008, Beverly Hills, California) American actor, known for his chiseled features and compelling speaking voice and for his numerous roles as historical figures and famous literary characters.
Heston decided to become an actor after impulsively auditioning for a high-school play. His stage experience in high school resulted in a scholarship to Northwestern University. In 1946 he moved to New York City, and he made his Broadway debut in Antony and Cleopatra (1947). Soon thereafter he landed roles in live television productions. His first Hollywood film was Dark City (1950). Although he was still relatively unknown, his performance impressed director Cecil B. DeMille, who cast him as the circus manager in The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). The film won the Oscar for best picture of the year, and Heston received good notices for his performance. He next starred as Andrew Jackson in The President’s Lady (1953), the first of many historical roles he would undertake.
