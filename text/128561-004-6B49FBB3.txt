James Roosevelt Bayley, the first Catholic bishop of Newark, established Seton Hall College in 1856, naming it for his aunt, St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, the founder of the Sisters of Charity and the first saint born in America. In 1861 he founded the Immaculate Conception Seminary, based at the college. Seton Hall opened New Jersey’s first colleges of nursing (1937) and medicine and dentistry (1956); the medical and dental college was acquired by the state in the mid-1960s. When Seton Hall was organized into a university in 1950 it comprised divisions of arts and sciences, business, nursing, and education; the law school opened in 1951. The university became wholly coeducational in 1968. Seton Hall is one of the oldest and largest diocesan Catholic universities in the United States.
