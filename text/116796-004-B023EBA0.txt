Sir William Withey Gull, 1st Baronet,  (born Dec. 31, 1816, Colchester, Essex, Eng.—died  Jan. 29, 1890, London) leading English physician of his time, lecturer and physician at Guy’s Hospital, London, and an outstanding clinical teacher.
Gull received his M.D. from the University of London in 1846 and became lecturer on physiology and anatomy and then physician, at Guy’s, where he taught or served as consulting physician for the rest of his life. He was a famous and popular teacher, and some of his epigrams are still current. Gull had a successful and fashionable private practice as well—including among his patients Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales—which made him wealthier than any English physician before his time. He was created a baronet in 1872.
