Regnitz River, left-bank tributary of the Main River, Bavaria Land (state), southeastern Germany. It is formed at Fürth by the confluence of the Pegnitz and the Rednitz; the headstreams are the Schwäbische and Fränkische Rezat. The Regnitz flows north for 42 miles (68 km) past Fürth, Erlangen, and Forchheim, from which point it is navigable, to enter the Main just below Bamberg. It cuts across a lowland of sandstones and clays, much of which is covered with pine forests. The cultivation of hops in the river valley is important for the Nürnberg brewing industry. The old and inadequate Ludwigs Kanal, connecting the Main to the Danube, was supplemented in the 1960s by a new canal parallel to the Regnitz.
