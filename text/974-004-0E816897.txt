Laburnum (genus Laburnum), genus of two species of poisonous trees and shrubs belonging to the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family (Fabaceae). The wood of Scotch, or alpine, laburnum (Laburnum alpinum) has a striking greenish brown or reddish brown hue and takes a good polish. It is ideal for cabinetmaking and inlay and was at one time the most prized timber in Scotland. Golden chain (L. anagyroides) is native to southern Europe and is cultivated as an ornamental for its attractive flowers.
The leaves of both species are composed of three oval leaflets and are borne on elongated stalks. The bright yellow flowers hang in pendulous racemes up to 25 cm (10 inches) in length and produce pods that are slender and compressed. All parts of laburnums are poisonous, especially the seeds, and occasionally the plants have proved fatal to cattle, though hares and rabbits are unharmed.
