National Spelling Bee, in full Scripps National Spelling Bee; formerly (until 2004) Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee,  spelling bee held annually in the Washington, D.C., area that serves as the culmination of a series of local and regional bees contested by students (mostly American) in grades below the high-school level. It is administered on a not-for-profit basis by the E.W. Scripps Company as an educational promotion.
Although a nationwide spelling competition for children had been contested in 1908 under the auspices of the National Education Association, the idea was not revisited until 1925. In that year the Louisville Courier-Journal, the organizer of a state bee for Kentucky grade-school students, invited other American newspapers to join it in sponsoring students to compete in a national bee. More than two million schoolchildren entered competitions on the local level, and by June the field had been narrowed to nine contestants—one for each participating newspaper—who were sent to Washington. The inaugural champion was 11-year-old Frank Neuhauser of Louisville, who correctly spelled gladiolus to claim a prize of $500. The event proved popular, and the number of participating newspapers (and therefore contestants) soon proliferated. In 1941 the sponsorship of the national bee was assumed by the Scripps newspaper conglomerate, though individual newspapers continued to represent students regionally. Merriam-Webster began an affiliation with the bee in 1958, with its Webster’s Third unabridged dictionary emerging as the official arbiter of a word’s spelling; the company also produced a study guide for contestants.
