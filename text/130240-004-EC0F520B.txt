Hashish, also spelled hasheesh, Arabic ḥashīsh (“dried herb”), Hindi hharas,  hallucinogenic drug preparation derived from the resin secreted by the flowering tops of cultivated female plants of the genus Cannabis. More loosely, in Arabic-speaking countries the term may denote a preparation made from any of various parts of cannabis plants—such as the leaves or dried flowering tops, used to prepare what is elsewhere more commonly called marijuana. The hashish made from resin is known by many names, including bhong and ganja, and is far more potent than marijuana. It may be either smoked or eaten for its intoxicating effects. The active ingredient is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which constitutes 10 to 15 percent of hashish; marijuana has less. Most hashish comes from the Middle East, Nepal, and other Asian countries, as well as from Latin America.
