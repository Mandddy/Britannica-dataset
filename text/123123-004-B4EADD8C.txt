Pedicab, three-wheeled vehicle with a hooded carriage body balanced on two of the wheels. The body may be placed in front or in back of the driver, who propels the vehicle by pedaling. Pedicabs are the successors to rickshaws and have been widely used in East and Southeast Asia. The pedicab has been adapted for specialized uses; one example is a pedicab school bus.
