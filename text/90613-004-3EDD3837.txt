William Powell, in full William Horatio Powell  (born July 29, 1892, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died March 5, 1984, Palm Springs, California) versatile American motion picture and stage actor who played villains in Hollywood silent films and intelligent, debonair leading men in the sound era. He is best remembered as Nick Charles in The Thin Man series of films.
After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City in 1912, Powell debuted on Broadway, playing three small roles in The Ne’er-Do-Well (1912). He then worked in road and stock companies before appearing as the hero’s rival in the hit Broadway play Spanish Love (1920). That success led to his appearance as Professor Moriarty’s evil henchman in the silent film Sherlock Holmes (1922), starring John Barrymore. Altogether, Powell appeared in more than 30 silents, usually playing a dastardly villain, notably in Romola (1924), Beau Geste (1926), and The Last Command (1928).
