Ty Cobb, in full Tyrus Raymond Cobb, byname the Georgia Peach  (born December 18, 1886, Narrows, Georgia, U.S.—died July 17, 1961, Atlanta, Georgia) professional baseball player, considered one of the greatest offensive players in baseball history and generally regarded as the fiercest competitor in the game.
Cobb took to baseball early in his life: by age 14 he was playing alongside adults on the local baseball team in Royston, Georgia. In 1904 he joined a semiprofessional team in Anniston, Alabama, and the following year he signed with the minor league Augusta (Georgia) Tourists. While playing with the Tourists, Cobb had his personal life jolted by an unusual tragedy: on August 8, 1905, his mother shot and killed his father, who was atop the family’s porch roof in an attempt to catch her being unfaithful and whom she purportedly mistook for a burglar. That event overshadowed his promotion to the Detroit Tigers later that month. His combative reaction to his subsequent rookie hazing created animosity between Cobb and his teammates that lasted for years, which greatly helped to establish the antagonistic public persona that would become one of Cobb’s hallmarks.
