British soldiers (Cladonia cristatella), species of lichen with erect hollow branches that end in distinctive red fruiting bodies from which the popular name is derived. It is greener and redder in early spring than at other times. It occurs on the ground or on dead wood, and its diminutive size makes it a good specimen for terrariums.
