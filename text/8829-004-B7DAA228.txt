Vestris family, a family of dancers who dominated French ballet for nearly a century, most notably Gaétan Vestris (in full Gaetano Apollino Baldassare Vestri, or Vestris; b. April 18, 1729, Florence, Italy—d. September 23, 1808, Paris, France) and his son Auguste Vestris (in full Marie-Jean-Augustin Vestris; b. March 27, 1760, Paris—d. December 5, 1842, Paris).
The dynasty of Vestris in the annals of ballet was founded by the engagement at the Paris Opéra in 1749 of Gaétan Vestris as principal male dancer in the serious, or noble, style (one of the three categories for principal dancers in use at the Opéra until 1830). He succeeded the celebrated Louis Dupré, who had long been acclaimed as the exemplar of the noble style that traced its origins to the court ballets of the previous century. Vestris, however, a Florentine by birth, brought to his performance a somewhat more flamboyant flavour, while respecting the traditional technique and manner of his predecessor. With his elegant figure and noble bearing, he made an immediate impression, and his brother’s exclamation that he was indeed “le dieu de la danse” (“the god of the dance”) gave him a sobriquet of which he was inordinately proud. At the time of his engagement, ballet was still a decorative feature of opera, and he appeared in many of the great opera-ballets of Jean-Philippe Rameau and André Campra. No dancer before him had received such acclaim, and the vanity this fostered in Vestris inspired many an anecdote; he was supposed to have said that there were only three great men in Europe: the king of Prussia, Voltaire, and himself.
