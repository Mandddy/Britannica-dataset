Daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus), also called common daffodil or trumpet narcissus,  bulb-forming plant in the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae), widely cultivated for its trumpetlike flowers. Daffodils are native to northern Europe and are grown in temperate climates around the world. The daffodil’s popularity has resulted in the production of many varieties; in addition to the classic yellow form, the trumpet and petals may themselves be of contrasting yellow, white, pink, or orange.
The daffodil is a perennial and grows to about 41 cm (16 inches) in height. Each plant features five or six linear leaves that grow from the bulb and are about 30 cm (12 inches) long. The stem bears one large yellow blossom with a corolla deeply cleft into six lobes and a central bell-shaped crown, or corona, that is frilled at its edges. This trumpet shape contains the stamens and is the flower’s most conspicuous feature.
