Leigh Hunt, in full James Henry Leigh Hunt  (born October 19, 1784, Southgate, Middlesex, England—died August 28, 1859, Putney, London) English essayist, critic, journalist, and poet, who was an editor of influential journals in an age when the periodical was at the height of its power. He was also a friend and supporter of the poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats. Hunt’s poems, of which “Abou Ben Adhem” and his rondeau “Jenny Kissed Me” (both first published in 1838) are probably the best known, reflect his knowledge of French and Italian versification. His defense of Keats’s work in the Examiner (June 1817) as “poetry for its own sake” was an important anticipation of the views of the Aesthetic movement.
Hunt, at his best, in some essays and his Autobiography (1850; in part a rewriting of Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries, 1828), has a distinctive charm. He excels in perceptive judgments of his contemporaries, from Keats to Alfred, Lord Tennyson. As a Radical journalist, though not much interested in the details of politics, he attacked oppression with indignation.
