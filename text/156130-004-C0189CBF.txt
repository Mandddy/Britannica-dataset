Grijalva River, Spanish Río Grijalva,  river in southeastern Mexico. Its headstreams, the largest of which is the Cuilco, rise in the Sierra Madre of Guatemala and the Sierra de Soconusco of Mexico. The Grijalva flows generally northwestward through Chiapas state, where it is known locally as the Río Grande de Chiapa, or the Río Chiapa. After leaving a lake created by the Malpaso Dam, it turns northward and eastward, roughly paralleling the Chiapas-Tabasco state border. Veering northward again at Villahermosa, the capital of Tabasco, it receives the main arm of the Usumacinta River and empties into the Gulf of Mexico and the Bay of Campeche, 6 miles (10 km) north-northwest of Frontera. The river is navigable by shallow-draft vessels for approximately 60 miles (95 km) upstream from the bay and for several stretches along its middle and upper course. The river is named for the Spaniard Juan de Grijalva, who discovered it in 1518. The Grijalva River’s total length is approximately 400 miles (640 km).
