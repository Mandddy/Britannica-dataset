Browser, software that allows a computer user to find and view information on the Internet. Web browsers interpret the HTML tags in downloaded documents and format the displayed data according to a set of standard style rules.
When British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, he also created the first browser, WorldWideWeb, which became available in 1991 and could also be used to edit Web pages. Web use expanded rapidly after the release in 1993 of Mosaic, which used “point-and-click” graphical manipulations and was the first browser to display both text and images on a single page. The team behind Mosaic created Netscape Navigator, which was optimized for home users browsing at the slow speeds of dial-up modems. Netscape Navigator became the dominant Web browser soon after its release in 1994. BookLink Technologies’s InternetWorks, the first browser with tabs, in which a user could visit another Web site without opening an entirely new window, debuted that same year. Microsoft released its browser Internet Explorer in 1995. Internet Explorer came bundled with the Microsoft Windows operating system and supplanted Netscape Navigator as the dominant browser by the late 1990s.
