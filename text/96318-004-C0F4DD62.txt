R. Dale Hylton, in full Robert Dale Hylton  (born May 20, 1930, Strathmore, Calif., U.S.—died Feb. 1, 2008, Decatur, Ill.) animal rights activist and educator in the humane treatment of animals who served for more than three decades as adviser, consultant, and investigator for the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS).
During World War II, Hylton’s parents divorced and his mother remarried. Hylton moved with his mother and stepfather to San Bernardino, Calif., where the family coped with nationwide food rationing by growing vegetables, canning fruit from local groves, and raising animals, including milk cows and chickens. Hylton was affectionate toward animals from an early age, even adopting a bull calf as a personal pet.
