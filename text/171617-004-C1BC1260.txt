Charles-André, Comte Pozzo di Borgo, original Italian Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo   (born March 8, 1768, Alata, Corsica—died February 15, 1842, Paris, France) Corsican nobleman who entered the Russian diplomatic service and promoted French interests after the Napoleonic Wars in the courts of the Russian emperors Alexander I (reigned 1801–25) and Nicholas I (reigned 1825–55).
A native of Corsica, Pozzo favoured its political incorporation into France and, after Corsica was declared a département of France, served as Corsican delegate to the French Legislative Assembly (1791–92). After his return to Corsica, however, he supported a rebellion to make the island a British protectorate (1793). Following the end of British rule (1796), Pozzo accompanied Sir Gilbert Elliot, the former British viceroy in Corsica, to Vienna (1798), where he stayed until, in anticipation of Russia’s entry into an anti-Napoleonic coalition, he entered the Russian service.
