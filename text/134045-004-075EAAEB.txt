Oise River, river that rises in Belgium in the Ardennes mountains, southeast of Chimay. It enters France northeast of Hirson, 9 miles (15 km) from its source, and flows generally southwestward, watering the Paris Basin, to join the Seine River at Conflans, after a course of 188 miles (302 km). It traverses the Thiérache Hills, where it collects its important left-bank tributary, the Serre, and flows through a flat alluvial valley below Guise. It then cuts through the northern part of the limestone platform of the Île-de-France région and on through a valley flanked by the forests of Saint-Gobain, Compiègne, Hallatte, and Chantilly. Near Compiègne it receives its main tributary, the Aisne; and below the industrial town of Creil, it is joined by the Thérain. Other towns along the river include La Fère and Pontoise.
The Oise is a link in the canal system between the navigable waterways of the Seine system and the canals of the north of France, which connect the centre of the Paris Basin with the former coal basin (the Saint-Quentin and Nord canals) and the longest canals, leading to Dunkirk and Belgium. Its drainage basin is about 7,700 square miles (20,000 square km) in area. Several battles of World War I were fought along its riverbanks.
