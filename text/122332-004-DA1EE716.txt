Northamptonshire, administrative and historic county in the East Midlands of England. The administrative county comprises seven districts: Daventry, East Northamptonshire, South Northamptonshire, and the boroughs of Corby, Kettering, Northampton, and Wellingborough. The historic county encompasses the entire administrative county, as well as the small area south of the River Welland in the town of Market Harborough, which lies in the district of Harborough in the administrative county of Leicestershire. The historic county also includes the Soke of Peterborough, a historic region that forms part of the city and unitary authority of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire. The county town (seat) is Northampton.
The administrative county is oval-shaped, with the long axis extending 56 miles (90 km) in a southwest-northeast direction. A ridge of low hills, an escarpment of Jurassic rocks, runs along the long axis and separates the basin of the River Nene in the south from that of the Welland in the north. Both these rivers flow east into The Wash (an embayment of the North Sea). Among the rocks above the escarpment are the ore-bearing Northampton Sands, which yielded a low-grade iron ore and were once extensively worked.
