John Prescott, in full John Leslie Prescott, Baron Prescott of Kingston-upon-Hull  (born May 31, 1938, Prestatyn, Wales) British politician who served as deputy leader of the Labour Party (1994–2007) and as deputy prime minister under Tony Blair (1997–2007).
Prescott came from a working-class family; his grandfather was a coal miner and his father a railwayman. After leaving school at age 15, Prescott worked for two years as a trainee chef and then as a steward (1955–63) on Cunard Line passenger ships. He became active in the Labour Party and the National Union of Seamen. In March 1966 he stood unsuccessfully for the House of Commons constituency of Southport. Three months later he helped to organize a seamen’s strike, although Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson condemned the “tightly-knit group of politically motivated men” behind the strike. He went on to attend the University of Hull, where he received a degree in economics and economic history in 1968.
