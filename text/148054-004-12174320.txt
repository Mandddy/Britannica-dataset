Jaguarundi, also spelled Jaguarondi,   (Puma yagouaroundi), small, unspotted New World cat (family Felidae), also known as the otter-cat because of its otterlike appearance and swimming ability. The jaguarundi is native to forested and brushy regions, especially those near water, from South America to the southwestern United States; it is, however, very rare north of Mexico.
A sleek, long-bodied animal, it has small ears, short legs, and a long tail. The adult measures from 90 to 130 cm (36 to 51 inches) in length, including the 30- to 60-cm tail; stands 25 to 30 cm at the shoulder; and weighs from 4.5 to 9 kg (10 to 20 pounds). There are two colour varieties of the jaguarundi: a reddish brown form, known as the eyra, and a gray form. Kittens of both varieties may appear in one litter.
