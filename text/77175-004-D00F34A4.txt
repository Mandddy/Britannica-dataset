Twelve O’Clock High, American war film, released in 1949, that was noted for its groundbreaking depiction of the psychological effects of war on soldiers.
American attorney Harvey Stovall (played by Dean Jagger) is a tourist in London in 1949 when he happens upon an old Toby jug (a beer jug in the shape of a man) in an antique shop. The jug reminds him of his days in England during World War II, and he subsequently visits the village of Archbury and the abandoned airfield where seven years earlier he had served with the U.S. 8th Army Air Force 918th Bombardment Group. The film then shifts to 1942, proceeding in flashback. Stovall recalls Frank Savage (Gregory Peck), the hard-as-nails new brigadier general put in charge of his “unlucky” and undisciplined bombing squadron, made up of exhausted and emotionally spent men. According to Savage, the previous commander had grown too close to his men, and the new tough policies that Savage institutes alienate the airmen until they see that his policies are the ones that will keep them alive. Savage castigates the men, tells them to stop pitying themselves, and musters their morale as they prepare for longer and more dangerous daylight missions far into German territory. (Whenever a new mission is imminent, the Toby jug on the mantle of the officers’ club is turned outward, away from the wall; “Not again,” says an officer when he sees the jug’s face.) Savage knows many of the young airmen will die in the forthcoming missions, and this weighs so heavily on his conscience that he himself has a breakdown during a mission. Like his predecessor, Savage grew to “care too much,” and he is then relieved of his duties.
