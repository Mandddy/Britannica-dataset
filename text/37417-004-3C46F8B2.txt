Saint Leo I, byname Leo The Great  (born 4th century, Tuscany?—died Nov. 10, 461, Rome; Western feast day November 10 ([formerly April 11]), Eastern feast day February 18) pope from 440 to 461, master exponent of papal supremacy. His pontificate—which saw the disintegration of the Roman Empire in the West and the formation in the East of theological differences that were to split Christendom—was devoted to safeguarding orthodoxy and to securing the unity of the Western church under papal supremacy.
Consecrated on Sept. 29, 440, as successor to St. Sixtus III, Leo, one of the few popes termed great, immediately worked to suppress heresy, which he regarded as the cause of corruption and disunity. Yet his most significant theological achievement was not his negative suppression of heresy but his positive formulation of orthodoxy.
