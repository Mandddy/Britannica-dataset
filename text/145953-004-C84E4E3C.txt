Palace of Fine Arts, Spanish Palacio de Bellas Artes,  cultural centre in Mexico City that was built between 1904 and 1934. The palace contains a large theatre, concert hall, museum of popular arts, and halls and galleries for paintings and other works of art. Balcony lobbies display murals by Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, and other Mexican artists. Examples of 19th- and 20th-century Mexican painting and special displays of paintings and sculpture are featured.
A national showplace, the Palace of Fine Arts has interior architectural decorations representing Mexican plant and animal life and masks recalling pre-Hispanic traditions. The stage in the main theatre is fitted with a curtain made of pieces of coloured glass designed by the Mexican artist Doctor Atl (Gerardo Murillo) and made in New York City by Louis Comfort Tiffany in 1911. A huge dome surmounts the palace. The whole building sank more than 15 feet (4.6 metres) into the ground after its completion.
