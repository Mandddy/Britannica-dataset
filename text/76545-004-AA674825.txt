George Sewall Boutwell,  (born Jan. 28, 1818, Brookline, Mass., U.S.—died  Feb. 27, 1905, Groton, Mass.) leading Radical Republican during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era.
Boutwell worked as a clerk while teaching himself law and in 1842 was elected to the state legislature. In 1851 a coalition of antislavery Democrats and Free Soilers elected Boutwell governor of Massachusetts. But Boutwell found it impossible to remain a Democrat as the antislavery controversy intensified during the 1850s. In 1855 he helped organize the Republican Party in Massachusetts, and in 1860 he supported Abraham Lincoln’s bid for the presidency.
