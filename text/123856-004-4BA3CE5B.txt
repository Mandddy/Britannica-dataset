Zincite,  mineral consisting of zinc oxide (ZnO), usually found in platy or granular masses. Its blood-red colour and orange-yellow streak are characteristic, as is also its common association with black franklinite and white calcite. Notable specimens have been found at Franklin and Sterling Hill, near Ogdensburg, N.J. Zincite crystallizes in the hexagonal system. Distinct crystals are rare; they are hemimorphic and consist of a single basal plane and a hexagonal pyramid. Manganese may partially replace zinc in some specimens.
