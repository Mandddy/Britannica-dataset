Cherie Booth, married name Cherie Booth Blair  (born Sept. 23, 1954, Bury, Lancashire, Eng.) British attorney specializing in issues of public law and human rights, among others. She is also the wife of Tony Blair, who served as prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007.
Boothâ€™s parents, Anthony Booth and Gale Smith, were actors, socialists, and Roman Catholics. Her life became significantly harder when her father left her mother in the early 1960s. Though he went on to become a well-known comedy actor through the long-running BBC television series Till Death Do Us Part, his private life dissolved into alcoholism, philandering, and debt, and Smith and her children never benefited materially from his acting success. Cherie Booth attended Roman Catholic schools near Liverpool and subsequently studied law at the London School of Economics.
