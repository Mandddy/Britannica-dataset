As provided by state legislation in 1921, Stephen F. Austin Teachers College was founded in 1923. The campus was built on land that was formerly owned by U.S. Senator Thomas J. Rusk. A notable marker on campus is the historic monument Old Stone Fort (now a museum), which was originally erected in 1779 by Captain Antonio Gil Y’barbo, an early settler of Nacogdoches. The fort was held by various nations and republics and was rebuilt in 1936. Enrollment grew rapidly in the early 1960s, and in 1969 the college was elevated to university status.
