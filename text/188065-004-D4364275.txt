Maya Plisetskaya, in full Maya Mikhaylovna Plisetskaya  (born November 20, 1925, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died May 2, 2015, Munich, Germany) Russian prima ballerina of the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, admired particularly for her technical virtuosity, expressive use of her arms, and ability to integrate acting with dancing.
Plisetskaya, a niece of the dancers Asaf and Sulamith Messerer, studied with Pavel (or Paul) Gerdt’s daughter Yelizaveta and with Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova and graduated from the Bolshoi school in 1943. Plisetskaya was noted for her unique, individualistic portrayals in both Soviet and classic ballets. Her repertory included Zarema in The Fountain of Bakhchisaray; the title role in Laurencia; Mistress of the Copper Mountain in The Stone Flower; Kitri in Don Quixote; Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis, in Giselle; Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty; and the dual character Odette-Odile in Swan Lake, frequently considered her greatest role.
