Bernese mountain dog, breed of Swiss working dog taken to Switzerland over 2,000 years ago by invading Romans. The breed was widely used in Switzerland to pull carts and to drive cattle to and from their pastures. The Bernese mountain dog is noted for its hardiness. It has a broad chest, hanging, V-shaped ears, and a long, silky, black coat with rust-coloured spots on the chest and forelegs and over the eyes and white on the chest, nose, tail tip, and, sometimes, the feet. The Bernese mountain dog stands 25 to 27.5 inches (63.5 to 70 cm) and weighs, ideally, about 88 pounds (40 kg).
