Jamie Foxx, original name Eric Marlon Bishop  (born December 13, 1967, Terrell, Texas, U.S.) American comedian, musician, and actor, who became known for his impersonations on the television sketch-comedy show In Living Color and later proved himself a versatile film actor, especially noted for his Academy Award-winning portrayal of Ray Charles in Ray (2004).
Bishop’s parents separated soon after his birth, and he was adopted by his maternal grandparents. He began playing piano about age five and became keenly interested in music, later earning a scholarship to United States International University (later Alliant International University) in San Diego to study classical piano and music theory. While attending school, Bishop began performing at local comedy clubs. At open-mike nights he delighted audiences with his bitingly funny impersonations of former U.S. president Ronald Reagan, boxer Mike Tyson, and comedian Bill Cosby. Discovering that it was easier for women to get stage time at open-mike nights, Bishop adopted the gender-neutral name of Jamie Foxx. In 1991 Foxx won the Bay Area Black Comedy Competition, which led to an audition for the Fox television network’s hit show In Living Color. His impersonations and his drag character Wanda, an ugly, sexually aggressive woman, impressed the show’s creator and star, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and earned Foxx a job as a regular. At that time Foxx also had a recurring role on the sitcom Roc.
