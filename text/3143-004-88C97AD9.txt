Polyomino, equal-sized squares, joined to at least one other along an edge, employed for recreational purposes. The name for such multisquare tiles, or pieces, was introduced in 1953 in analogy to dominoes. Asymmetrical pieces, which have different shapes when they are flipped over, are counted as one.
The number of distinct polyominoes of any order is a function of the number of squares in each, but, as yet, no general formula has been found. It has been shown, though, that there are 35 types of hexominoes (composed of six squares) and 108 types of heptominoes (seven squares), if the dubious heptomino with an interior “hole” is included.
