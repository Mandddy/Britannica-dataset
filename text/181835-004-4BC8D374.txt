Gustav Falke,  (born January 11, 1853, Lübeck [Germany]—died  February 8, 1916, Grossborstel, near Hamburg) German poet and novelist prominent among the new lyric poets of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His verses were influenced by folk songs and the Romantic poets and celebrated simple domestic pleasures.
Falke worked first as a bookseller and then as a music teacher (1878) until a pension (1903) from the Hamburg government enabled him to devote his time to writing. His best known poems are contained in Mynheer der Tod (1892; “Mynheer Death”), Hohe Sommertage (1902; “High Summer Days”), and Frohe Fracht (1907; “Happy Load”). His novels include Der Mann im Nebel (1899; “The Man in the Fog”) and Die Kinder aus Ohlsens Gang (1908; “The Children from Ohlsen’s Passage”). He also published volumes of short stories, Geelgösch (1910) and Der Spanier (1910; “The Spaniard”), and the autobiographical Stadt mit den goldenen Türmen (1912; “City with the Golden Towers”).
