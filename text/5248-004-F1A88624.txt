William Lowndes Yancey,  (born Aug. 10, 1814, Warren County, Ga., U.S.—died July 27, 1863, Montgomery, Ala.) American southern political leader and “fire-eater” who, in his later years, consistently urged the South to secede in response to Northern antislavery agitation.
Though born in Georgia, Yancey in 1822 moved with his mother and stepfather, an antislavery Presbyterian minister, to Troy, N.Y. Yancey attended Williams College from 1830 to 1833 and then studied law in Greenville, S.C. In 1834 he was admitted to the bar. As editor of the Greenville Mountaineer during the nullification crisis, he took a firm Unionist stand.
