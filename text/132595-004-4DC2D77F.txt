Joschka Fischer, original name in full Joseph Martin Fischer  (born April 12, 1948, Gerabronn, Ger.) German political activist and politician who in the 1990s led the Green Party of Germany (Die Grünen) into the government. He served as foreign minister and vice-chancellor (1998–2005) of Germany.
Fischer was born to a Hungarian father and a German mother who had been forced out of Hungary in 1946. He dropped out of high school to become a photographer’s apprentice. His political views were galvanized in 1967 when a student was shot dead by police following a political demonstration in West Berlin. (It later was discovered that the police officer responsible for the shooting was a spy for East Germany.) Fischer moved to Frankfurt in late 1968, where he joined the militant group Revolutionary Fight and participated in student riots and demonstrations. During his time there, he had several odd jobs, including that of taxi driver.
