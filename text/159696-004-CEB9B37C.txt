Isaac Watts,  (born July 17, 1674, Southampton, Hampshire, England—died November 25, 1748, Stoke Newington, London) English Nonconformist minister, regarded as the father of English hymnody.
Watts, whose father was a Nonconformist, studied at the Dissenting Academy at Stoke Newington, London, which he left in 1694. In 1696 he became tutor to the family of Sir John Hartopp of Stoke Newington (a centre of religious dissent) and of Freeby, Leicestershire, and preached his first sermons in the family chapel at Freeby. He was appointed assistant to the minister of Mark Lane Independent (i.e., Congregational) Chapel, London, in 1699 and in March 1702 became full pastor. He was apparently an inspiring preacher. Because of a breakdown in health (1712) he went to stay, intending a week’s visit, with Sir Thomas Abney in Hertfordshire; he remained with the Abneys for the rest of his life.
