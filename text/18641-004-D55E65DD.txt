Westchester, county, southeastern New York state, U.S., lying just north of New York City. It consists of a hilly region bounded to the east by Connecticut, to the southeast by Long Island Sound, and to the west by the Hudson River.
The original inhabitants of Westchester, Algonquian-speaking Wappinger Indians, were displaced in the 1640s by Dutch colonists along the Hudson and by colonists from New England along what is now the Connecticut border; most of the Wappinger moved westward in 1756. After the surrender of New Netherland to the English in 1664, Westchester became part of the Province of New York and was established as one of New York’s original counties in 1683. It was named for Chester, England. An area of divided allegiances with many Loyalist residents, it was the scene of extensive military activity during the American Revolution—including the Battle of White Plains (October 28, 1776), a raid by British Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton (1779), and the apprehension by the Americans of the British spy Major John André near Tarrytown (1780).
