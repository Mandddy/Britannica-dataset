Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld,  (born March 26, 1794, Leipzig, Saxony [Germany]—died May 24, 1872, Dresden, Germany) painter and designer who figured importantly in the German Nazarene movement.
Schnorr received his earliest instruction from his father, Hans Veit Schnorr, a draftsman, engraver, and painter, and in 1818 he went to Rome where he was associated with a group of painters who called themselves the Nazarenes, or Lucas Brotherhood (Lukasbund). Inspired by early Renaissance art and the works of Albrecht Dürer, Schnorr’s oil paintings were characterized by a precise linearity, clear bright colours, and a multiplicity of symbolic detail. He shared his fellow Nazarenes’ interest in a revival of fresco painting and the creation of a “monumental art.” Together with Johann Overbeck, Peter von Cornelius, and Philipp Veit, Schnorr received a commission to decorate the entrance hall of the Villa Massimo with frescoes after Ludovico Ariosto.
