After graduating from Harvard College in 1774, Ames taught school for five years before turning to law, and in 1781 he was admitted to the bar. Supporting the drive for a new, more powerful federal government, Ames became known for his uncompromising advocacy of the rights of property and his protective attitude toward commercial interests, which he argued for in trenchant writing and commanding speech. He argued for ratification of the U.S. Constitution at the Massachusetts convention, and in 1788 he defeated Samuel Adams for a seat in the first session of the U.S. House of Representatives. Ames was reelected in 1790, 1792, and 1794.
