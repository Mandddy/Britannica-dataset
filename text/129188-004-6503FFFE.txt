Forbidden Planet, American science- fiction film, released in 1956, that was noted for its groundbreaking and Academy Award-nominated special effects, all-electronic musical score, intelligent script, and robot “Robby.”
Astronauts in the 23rd century are sent to the distant planet Altair IV to find out why a previous expedition has disappeared. Once there, they find the reclusive professor Morbius (played by Walter Pidgeon) living with his beautiful daughter, Altaira (Anne Francis), and an amazing robot named Robby, who has a distinct personality and human traits. Morbius tells the astronauts that some unknown force killed the other settlers and shows them the vast underground city of the Krell, the long-dead natives of Altair IV. An invisible monster starts killing the astronauts, who discover that the monster is a projection of Morbius’s subconscious unleashed by his experiments with the mind-expanding machinery of the Krell.
