Friedrich Leopold, Graf zu Stolberg-Stolberg,  (born Nov. 7, 1750, Bramstedt, Holstein—died  Dec. 5, 1819, Schloss Sondermühlen, near Osnabrück, Hanover) German lyric poet of the Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress) and early Romantic periods.
Stolberg and his brother Christian, noblemen who were actually Danish subjects, studied law at Halle and at Göttingen, where in 1772 both became members of the Göttinger Hain, a group that met to discuss their poems and to further the ideals of friendship, virtue, freedom, love of fatherland, and interest in Germanic history. The two were caught up in the revolutionary mood of the times and wrote stirring odes to freedom and fatherland. A book of poems by the brothers, Gedichte, appeared in 1779. But Friedrich’s verse also has a pastoral, idyllic quality that ties his work to the Romantics. The combination of revolutionary and pacifist sentiments in Stolberg’s poems is striking.
