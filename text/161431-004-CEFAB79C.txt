Bill Evans, byname of William John Evans   (born August 16, 1929, Plainfield, New Jersey, U.S.—died September 15, 1980, New York, New York) American jazz pianist known for lush harmonies and lyrical improvisation, one of the most influential pianists of his time.
Evans’s first piano teacher was his mother; he also studied violin and flute. He graduated with a music teaching degree from Southeastern Louisiana College in 1950 and then went to New York City. After a brief period working as a pianist in the New York area, he was drafted into the army and played flute in the Fifth Army Band. Upon his return to civilian life, and to the piano, he seemed to burst onto the jazz scene: his first recordings, from 1956, reveal a fully formed technique characterized by a fresh harmonic approach and sensitive phrasing.
