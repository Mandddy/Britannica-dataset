Alfred von Kiderlen-Wächter,  (born July 10, 1852, Stuttgart, Württemberg—died December 30, 1912, Stuttgart) German statesman and foreign secretary remembered for his role in the Second Moroccan crisis (1911) before World War I.
After service in the Franco-German War (1870–71), Kiderlen studied law and entered the Prussian diplomatic service (1879). He was an exponent of the tough-minded post-Bismarckian German diplomacy and for a time enjoyed the favour of Emperor William II (Kaiser Wilhelm II), though his sharp tongue lost him that favour in 1898. Thereafter, he was sent as minister to Bucharest and for a time served in Constantinople, where he championed the Berlin–Baghdad Railway. In 1908 he was appointed deputy foreign secretary and was instrumental in keeping Russia from aiding Serbia during the crisis following Austria’s annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Already at this point Kiderlen advocated a belligerent foreign policy, whose success was purchased at the price of Russia’s enmity. In 1910 the new chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, overcame the emperor’s dislike of Kiderlen and named him secretary of state for foreign affairs.
