Hypsilophodon (genus Hypsilophodon), small to medium-sized herbivorous dinosaurs that flourished about 115 million to 110 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous Period. Hypsilophodon was up to 2 metres (6.5 feet) long and weighed about 60 kg (130 pounds). It had short arms with five fingers on each hand and was equipped with much longer four-toed feet. In its mouth was a set of high grooved, self-sharpening cheek teeth adapted for grinding plant matter; in its horny beak were several incisor-like teeth used to nip off vegetation.
For many decades paleontologists thought that Hypsilophodon’s long fingers and toes enabled it to live in trees, but this inference was based on an incorrect reconstruction of its foot, which suggested that it could grasp and perch. The dinosaur is now recognized to have been a ground dweller with a conventional ornithopod foot. Hypsilophodon is typical of a lineage of ornithopods known as Hypsilophodontidae. Two other major groups of ornithopods—the hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs, and the iguanodontids—are closely related. Hypsilophodontids survived into the Late Cretaceous, when they lived alongside the iguanodontids and hadrosaurs that probably arose from early members of the lineage.
