Jean Coralli, original name in full Giovanni Coralli Peracini  (born January 15, 1779, Paris, France—died May 1, 1854, Paris) French dancer and choreographer who was ballet master of the Paris Opéra and who, with Jules Perrot, created the Romantic ballet Giselle.
Coralli received his early training in Paris from Pierre Gardel or Jean-François Coulon and made his debut at the Paris Opéra in 1802. In 1806–07 he produced five ballets at the Court Opera in Vienna, and in 1808 he was appointed principal dancer at La Scala in Milan. He remained there as principal dancer until 1815, appearing in ballets by the most celebrated Italian choreographers of the time: Salvatore Viganò, Gaetano Gioja, and Pietro Angiolini. He danced in Lisbon in 1820, and in 1824–25 he returned briefly to Milan, where he staged four ballets.
