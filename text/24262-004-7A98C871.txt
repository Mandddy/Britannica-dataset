Anthrosol, one of the 30 soil groups in the classification system of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Anthrosols are defined as any soils that have been modified profoundly by human activities, including burial, partial removal, cutting and filling, waste disposal, manuring, and irrigated agriculture. These soils vary widely in their biological, chemical, and physical properties. Occupying 0.004 percent of the continental land surface of the Earth, they are growing in extent along with the influence of human society on the soil environment.
