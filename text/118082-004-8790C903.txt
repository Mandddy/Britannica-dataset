Learned Hand, in full Billings Learned Hand   (born Jan. 27, 1872, Albany, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  Aug. 18, 1961, New York City) American jurist whose tough and sometimes profound mind, philosophical skepticism, and faith in the United States were employed throughout a record tenure as a federal judge (52 years, from April 10, 1909, until his death). Although he was never a justice of the Supreme Court, he is generally considered to have been a greater judge than all but a few of those who have sat on the highest U.S. court.
At Harvard University, Hand studied philosophy (under William James, Josiah Royce, and George Santayana) and law, and thereafter he practiced law in Albany and New York City. In 1909 he was appointed a federal district judge in New York, and in 1924 he was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the second circuit (New York, Connecticut, and Vermont), one of his colleagues being his cousin Augustus Noble Hand. From 1939 he served as chief judge. He sat in many cases after his official retirement in 1951.
