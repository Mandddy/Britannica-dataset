White Heat, American crime film released in 1949 that is considered the definitive James Cagney vehicle and perhaps the best of the Warner Brothers crime dramas.
Cody Jarrett (played by Cagney) is a cold-blooded killer who has an uncomfortable oedipal relationship with his domineering mother (Margaret Wycherly). When Jarrett learns of her murder while he is in prison, he virtually wrecks the mess hall in a fit of uncontrolled rage. Soon after, he and several other inmates—one of whom is actually an undercover agent (Edmond O’Brien)—escape from prison. After Jarrett’s gang decides to rob a chemical factory, the agent alerts the police to their plans. In the ensuing gunfight, Jarrett becomes cornered atop an oil-refinery tank. He screams, “Made it, Ma! Top of the world!” as he unloads his gun into the tank, and he dies in the resulting inferno.
