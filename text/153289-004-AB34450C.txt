Colgate University, private, coeducational institution of higher learning in Hamilton, New York, U.S. The university offers a liberal arts curriculum for undergraduates and several masterâ€™s degree programs. Campus facilities include an automated observatory, the Dana Arts Center, and the Longyear Museum of Anthropology. Total enrollment exceeds 2,700.
The university was chartered in 1819 as the Baptist Education Society of the State of New York. Instruction began in 1820, and three years later the school became known as the Hamilton Literary and Theological Institution. The name was changed to Madison University in 1846 and, in 1890, to Colgate, honouring the philanthropy of soapmaker William Colgate and his family. When the theological school merged with the Rochester Divinity School in 1928, Colgate became a nonsectarian university. Women were first admitted in 1970. Poets Anne Sexton and Charles Tomlinson taught at Colgate. Notable alumni include filmmaker John Cassavetes and political leader Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.
