Fibreglass, also spelled Fiberglass, also called Glass Fibre,  fibrous form of glass that is used principally as insulation and as a reinforcing agent in plastics.
Glass fibres were little more than a novelty until the 1930s, when their thermal and electrical insulating properties were appreciated and methods for producing continuous glass filaments were developed. Modern manufacture begins with liquid glass obtained directly from a glass-melting furnace or from the remelting of preformed glass marbles. For producing continuous fibre, the liquid is fed into a bushing, a receptacle that is pierced with hundreds of fine nozzles through which the liquid issues in fine streams. The solidifying streams are gathered into a single strand, which is wound onto a spool. Strands can be twisted or plied into yarns, woven into fabrics, or chopped into short pieces and then bonded into mats. Discontinuous fibres are most often made in a rotary process, in which fine streams of glass are flung outward through holes in a spinning dish and are then broken and blown downward by a blast of air or steam. The fibres collect on a moving conveyor and are formed into wools, mats, or boards.
