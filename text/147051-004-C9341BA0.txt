Bernard Hopkins,  (born January 15, 1965, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American boxer who dominated the middleweight division in the early 2000s with a combination of speed and precision that earned him the nickname “The Executioner.”
Hopkins was involved in street crime as a teenager, and at age 17 he was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to prison. He served 56 months, during which time he took up boxing, and after his release on parole in 1988, he maintained a clean record. He had his first professional bout on October 11, 1988, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but he was unable to earn a living as a full-time boxer and supplemented his income by washing pots and pans in the kitchen of a Philadelphia hotel. Later he worked at an auto transmission repair shop owned by his trainer, Bouie Fisher. Hopkins won the vacant International Boxing Federation (IBF) middleweight title by knocking out Segundo Mercado in the seventh round on April 29, 1995, in Landover, Maryland, but even with this victory behind him, he struggled to find meaningful bouts.
