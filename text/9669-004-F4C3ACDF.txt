Perilla oil dries in less time than linseed oil and on drying forms a film that is harder and yellows more than that formed by linseed oil. The paint and varnish industry accounts for the largest usage. Perilla oil also is important in the manufacture of printing inks and linoleum. In the Orient perilla oil is used as an edible oil. Perilla has been cultivated in China, Korea, Japan, and northern India. The seeds contain 35 to 45 percent oil.
