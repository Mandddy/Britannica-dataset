Raoul Walsh, original name Albert Edward Walsh  (born March 11, 1887, New York City, New York, U.S.—died December 31, 1980, Simi Valley, California) American motion-picture director popular in the 1930s and 1940s for his tough, masculine films.
As a young man, Walsh worked a variety of jobs in Mexico and Texas. His acting career began in 1907 when he performed onstage in San Antonio. Shortly thereafter he returned to New York (where he took the name Raoul), and by 1909 he was playing cowboy roles in silent films for the Pathé brothers. Around 1913, he began working for D.W. Griffith at Biograph, first as an actor and then as an assistant director. When Griffith’s company left Biograph and moved to Hollywood, Griffith sent Walsh to Mexico to shoot footage of Pancho Villa, which was incorporated into The Life of General Villa (1914), with Walsh both codirecting and playing the part of the young Villa. In The Birth of a Nation (1915), Walsh played Pres. Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, actor John Wilkes Booth, but he spent most of his energy directing, earning 18 credits alone in 1915. A contract with Fox followed.
