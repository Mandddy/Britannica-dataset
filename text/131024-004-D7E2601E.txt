Rat snake, any of between 40 and 55 species of the genus Elaphe, of the family Colubridae and similar forms. They occur in North America, Europe, and Asia east to the Philippines. Most are found in woodlands and around farm buildings. They hunt rats and mice and kill them by constriction. They also eat eggs, and some species raid poultry yards and are sometimes called chicken snakes. Some hunt birds in trees and have the ventral scales keeled (ridged), for climbing. These rather large, nonvenomous, egg-laying snakes are normally slow and docile, but in self-defense they vibrate the tail, discharge a foul liquid from the anal gland, and strike from an upreared position.
The black rat snake, or pilot black snake (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta), of the eastern United States usually is about 1.2 m (about 4 feet) long but may exceed 2.5 m (8 feet). It is black, with whitish chin and throat—like the true black snake (see racer)—but has slightly keeled dorsal scales. Other races of E. obsoleta are tan, gray, yellow, reddish, or brown, and some are blotched or striped.
