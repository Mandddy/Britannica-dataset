Frankfurt am Main City Zoological Garden, German Zoologischer Garten Der Stadt Frankfurt Am Main, byname Frankfurt Zoo,  municipal zoological garden in Frankfurt am Main, Ger. It was founded in 1858 by the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Because the original site of the zoo was not large enough to allow for the expansion of the collection, in 1874 the zoo was relocated to its present 34.5-acre (14-hectare) site. The city of Frankfurt took over financial support of the zoo during World War I. Much of the grounds and collection were destroyed in 1944 during Allied bombing raids. The zoo was reopened the following year, and the rebuilding task continued through the 1950s under the direction of the noted zoologist Bernhard Grzimek.
Today, more than 5,000 specimens representing more than 600 species are exhibited at the Frankfurt Zoo. The zooâ€™s Exotarium contains an aquarium, a reptile hall, and an insect house. The zoo was among the first in Europe to successfully breed the okapi, black rhinoceros, and bongo antelope. It was also the site of the only known twin birth of lowland gorillas in captivity. The zoo maintains the studbook for this particular species.
