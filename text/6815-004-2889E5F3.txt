Box turtle, any of two groups, Asian and North American, of terrestrial and semiaquatic turtles. Box turtles have a high, rounded upper shell (carapace), a flattened bottom shell (plastron) with a transverse hinge, and ligamentous connections (instead of the bony bridge typical of most turtles) between plastron and carapace. Their common name is presumably derived from their ability to draw their head and limbs completely within the shell and close themselves up like a box. The presence of a hinge and ligamentous bridges permits this flexibility. Their high, domed shell makes them too large for many predators to consume whole, and the tight closure that occurs when all external parts are drawn into the shell makes box turtles difficult to crack open. The Asian and North American box turtles are not closely related in spite of their overall similarity. Cuora, the Asian genus, is part of family Geoemydidae, and Terrapene, the North American genus, is part of family Emydidae.
Cuora contains nine or more species that occur within subtropical and tropical regions of Asia from northeastern India to southeastern China and southward into the Sunda Islands and the Philippines. Asian box turtles are omnivorous, largely semiaquatic turtles that, depending on the species, have carapace lengths of 13–20 cm (5–8 inches) as adults. Each clutch size is typically two eggs, although two to four clutches are often deposited during a single nesting season.
