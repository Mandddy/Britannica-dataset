T Bone Burnett, byname of Joseph Henry Burnett  (born January 14, 1948, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.) American producer and musician, one of popular music’s most prolific and successful producers, known for his work in a wide range of genres including rock, country, and folk.
Burnett spent his childhood in Fort Worth, Texas, and it was there that he acquired the nickname “T Bone” and became involved in the local music scene, initially as a guitarist with local blues bands and later as the founder of his own recording studio. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s and recorded his debut solo album, The B-52 Band &amp; the Fabulous Skylarks (1972), a straightforward collection of bluesy rock tunes. In 1975 he received his major break into the industry, touring as a guitarist on Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue tour. His second solo album, Truth Decay (1980), shows Burnett’s maturation as an artist, but he found greater success in the production booth than he did as a performer.
