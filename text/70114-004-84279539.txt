Skeleton sledding, also called Cresta sledding,  winter sport in which the skeleton sled, or Cresta, consisting of steel runners fastened to a platform chassis, is ridden in a headfirst, prone position. Skeleton sledding competitions are typically held on the same courses used for bobsled contests. It is a dangerous and thrilling sport where riders, with their faces just inches above the icy course, attain speeds over 129 km (80 miles) per hour.
The sport of skeleton sledding developed on the famed Cresta Run, built in 1884 at Saint Moritz, Switzerland. The Cresta Run, which follows a 1,213-metre (1,327-yard) course from Saint Moritz to the town of Celerina, has hosted the annual Grand National championships since 1885. The 1887 Grand National saw the first competitors to careen down the run headfirst. A new sled made entirely of steel was introduced in 1892. The sled was popular with Cresta Run patrons, and some claim that its “bony” appearance gave the sled and the sport the name “skeleton.” Skeleton sledding was included twice in the Olympic Winter Games, in 1928 and 1948, each time at Saint Moritz, but, with the sport limited to competition only at the Cresta Run, it was surpassed in popularity by bobsled and luge and fell into obscurity. However, by the early 1970s adjustments to the skeleton sled and artificial bob runs were made and international skeleton competition was rejuvenated. By 1987 world championships and world cup competitions had been established, and the sport was recognized by the Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing (FIBT). Skeleton sledding returned to the Winter Olympics program in 2002 with events for both men and women.
