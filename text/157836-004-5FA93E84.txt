Michael Mann, in full Michael Kenneth Mann  (born February 5, 1943, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American director and screenwriter known for both his film and television work.
Mann graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English from the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1965. He went on to study at the London School of Film Technique (now London School of Film), earning a master’s degree in 1967. For several years Mann remained in England working on television commercials, but he eventually returned to the United States and began writing for television police dramas, including Starsky and Hutch and Police Story. He went on to create Vega$ (1978–81), a series centred on a Las Vegas detective, and he received his first directing credit for The Jericho Mile (1979), a made-for-TV movie about a prisoner training for the Olympics. Mann cowrote the teleplay with Patrick J. Nolan, and the pair won an Emmy Award for outstanding writing in a limited series or special.
