Pavel Nikolayevich Milyukov, Milyukov also spelled Miliukov  (born January 27 [January 15, Old Style], 1859, Moscow, Russian Empire—died March 3, 1943, Aix-les-Bains, France) Russian statesman and historian who played an important role in the events leading to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and served as foreign minister (March–May 1917) in Prince Lvov’s provisional government. He remains one of the greatest of Russia’s liberal historians.
Milyukov entered Moscow University in 1877 and soon attained academic distinction as a specialist in Russian history. His three-volume Ocherk po istorii russkoy kultury (1896–1903; Outlines of Russian Culture) brought him nationwide renown. He was, however, to become even better known as a spokesman for imperial Russia’s nascent liberal movement.
