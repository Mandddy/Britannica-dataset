Parallel bars, gymnastics apparatus invented in the early 19th century by the German Friedrich Jahn, usually considered the father of gymnastics. It is especially useful in improving upper-body strength. The two bars, made of wood, are oval in cross section, 5 cm (2 inches) thick, 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) long, 2 metres (6.5 feet) high, and 42 cm (16.5 inches) apart. Height and width of the bars are usually adjustable.
In gymnastics competition on the parallel bars, performed by men only, movements combine swings, flight elements, strength, and balance, although swings and vaults must predominate. Movements below the bars and the release and regrasping of the bars are also required. See also uneven parallel bars.
