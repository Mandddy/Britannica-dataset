Sidney Crosby,  (born August 7, 1987, Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada) Canadian ice hockey player who in 2007 became the youngest captain of a National Hockey League (NHL) team and who led the Pittsburgh Penguins to two Stanley Cup championships (2009, 2016).
Crosby, the son of a goaltender drafted by the Montreal Canadiens, was able to skate by age three. In his sophomore year of high school in Faribault, Minnesota, he scored 72 goals and had 90 assists in 57 games. This feat gained the attention of ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, who speculated that his own records would one day be surpassed by Crosby. In 2003 Rimouski Océanic, a Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team, drafted Crosby, who went on to score 120 goals and tally 183 assists in 121 regular-season games over two years. Each year he was named Canada’s top junior player. He also joined the Canadian National Junior Hockey team and became the youngest player to score a goal for the national team.
