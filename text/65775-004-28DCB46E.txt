Rodney Allen Brooks,  (born December 30, 1954, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia) computer scientist, artificial intelligence scientist, and designer of mobile autonomous robots.
While attending Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, where he received bachelor’s (1975) and master’s degrees (1978) in pure mathematics, Brooks was given access to the university’s mainframe computer for 12 hours each Sunday. This experience with computers was enough to convince Brooks to come to America to study with the artificial intelligence (AI) pioneer John McCarthy at Stanford University in California. Brooks chose a traditional AI problem for his doctoral research (1981), which he subsequently expanded and published as Model-Based Computer Vision (1984).
