Leadbelly, also spelled (particularly by the singer himself) Lead Belly, byname of Huddie William Ledbetter   (born Jan. 21, 1885?, Jeter Plantation, near Mooringsport, La., U.S.â€”died Dec. 6, 1949, New York, N.Y.) American folk-blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist whose ability to perform a vast repertoire of songs, in conjunction with his notoriously violent life, made him a legend.
Musical from childhood, Leadbelly played accordion, 6- and 12-string guitar, bass, and harmonica. He led a wandering life, learning songs by absorbing oral tradition. For a time he worked as an itinerant musician with Blind Lemon Jefferson. In 1918 he was imprisoned in Texas for murder. According to tradition he won his early release in 1925 by singing a song for the governor of Texas when he visited the prison.
