Punt, in ancient Egyptian and Greek geography, the southern coast of the Red Sea and adjacent coasts of the Gulf of Aden, corresponding to modern coastal Ethiopia and Djibouti.
To the ancients, Punt was a place of legend and fable, illustrated by Herodotus’ account (in Book II of his History, 5th century bc) of the exploits of an Egyptian pharaoh, one Sesostris, who took a fleet of ships and made conquests along the shores of the Erythraean Sea (the Red Sea and adjacent waters) and then traversed “the whole continent of Asia.”
