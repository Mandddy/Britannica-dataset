Seymour R. Cray,  (born Sept. 28, 1925, Chippewa Falls, Wis., U.S.—died Oct. 5, 1996, Colorado Springs, Colo.) American electronics engineer and computer designer who was the preeminent designer of the large high-speed computers known as supercomputers.
Cray graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1950 with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He began his career at Engineering Research Associates (ERA), a leading digital computer company. In 1957, when ERA was taken over in a series of corporate mergers, Cray left to help found Control Data Corp., which became a major computer manufacturer. There Cray led the design of the CDC 1604, one of the first computers to replace vacuum tubes with smaller transistors. He later helped create the CDC 6600, which, at the time of its debut in 1964, was the fastest computer in the world, able to execute three million floating-point operations per second (FLOPS). The CDC 6600 gave rise to the term supercomputer.
