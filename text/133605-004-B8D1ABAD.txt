Minamoto Yoshitsune,  (born 1159, Japan—died  June 15, 1189, Fort Koromogawa, Mutsu Province, Japan) warrior who engineered many of the military victories that helped his half brother Yoritomo gain control of Japan. He is probably the most popular Japanese historical figure of the period, and his romantic exploits have captured the imagination of the Japanese people, who have perpetuated numerous legends, stories, and kabuki plays celebrating the adventures of Yoshitsune and his faithful follower Benkei. Many Western-style novels and films have also been based on his life.
Yoshitsune was the son of Minamoto Yoshitomo (1123–60), who was killed while seeking refuge after his defeat by Taira Kiyomori in the Heiji Disturbance (1159). Kiyomori spared the infant Yoshitsune, who was placed in a monastery near the capital at Kyōto, where he trained to become a Buddhist priest. According to legend, on a bridge near the monastery, Yoshitsune encountered Benkei, who challenged him to a sword match. Easily defeated by Yoshitsune, Benkei became a trusted retainer.
