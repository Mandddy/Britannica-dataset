Sebastian Cabot,  (born c. 1476, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Eng., or Venice—died  1557, London) navigator, explorer, and cartographer who at various times served the English and Spanish crowns. He may have accompanied his father, John Cabot, on the first English voyage to North America (1497), which resulted in the discovery of the Labrador coast of Newfoundland (mistaken at the time for the coast of China).
Although facts concerning his early life remain obscure, Cabot was a cartographer to King Henry VIII in 1512, when he accompanied the English army sent to aid King Ferdinand II of Aragon against the French. Because of his knowledge of the northeast coast of North America, he was commissioned a captain in the Spanish navy, but Ferdinand’s death canceled a voyage he was to command in 1516. His services were retained by the Holy Roman emperor Charles V, and in 1518 he was given membership in the Spanish Council of the New Indies and appointed pilot major and official examiner of pilots.
