Fahrenheit 451, British science-fiction film, released in 1966, based on Ray Bradbury’s classic dystopian novel of the same name. It was French director François Truffaut’s only English-language film and his first colour production.
In a futuristic town, Guy Montag (played by Oskar Werner) works as a fireman but with an ironic twist: his job is to create bonfires of books, which have been banned. Montag is content with his life until several encounters lead him to hide books himself and, eventually, become a fugitive from the state. These encounters include meeting a young, attractive freethinker, Clarisse (Julie Christie), who tells him about a past when firemen were actually charged with putting out fires instead of starting them; the suicide of a woman who opts to die with her beloved books; and the increasing disinterestedness and emotional emptiness of his wife (also played by Christie), who is devoid of ideas and prefers drugs and government-controlled television to human interaction.
