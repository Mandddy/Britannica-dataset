Nirvana, (
        Sanskrit: “becoming extinguished” or “blowing out”) Pali nibbana,  in Indian religious thought, the supreme goal of certain meditation disciplines. Although it occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the Sanskrit term nirvana is most commonly associated with Buddhism, in which it is the oldest and most common designation for the goal of the Buddhist path. It is used to refer to the extinction of desire, hatred, and ignorance and, ultimately, of suffering and rebirth. Literally, it means “blowing out” or “becoming extinguished,” as when a flame is blown out or a fire burns out.
In his first sermon after his enlightenment, the Buddha (the founder of Buddhism) set forth the Four Noble Truths (one of the core teachings of Buddhism), the third of which was “cessation” (nirodha). This state of the cessation of suffering and its causes is nirvana. The term nirvana has entered Western parlance to refer to a heavenly or blissful state. The European valuation of nirvana as a state of annihilation was the source of the Victorian characterization of Buddhism as a negative and life-denying religion.
