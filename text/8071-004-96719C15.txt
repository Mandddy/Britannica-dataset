Plateosaurus (genus Plateosaurus), dinosaurs known from extensive fossil material found in Europe dating to the Late Triassic Period (about 229 million to 200 million years ago) that were representative of the prosauropods, an early group that might have been ancestral to the giant sauropod dinosaurs of later time periods.
Plateosaurus was among the earliest dinosaurs to attain a relatively large size, growing to about 8 metres (26 feet) long. It was more massive than earlier dinosaurs and had bones that were stocky and thick. Although Plateosaurus could rise up on its two very strong hind legs, its forelimbs also were relatively well developed and strong, and it may have walked on two or four legs for various purposes. The small skull was perched atop a long, flexible neck and contained flat teeth serrated on the front and back edges.
