Friedrich List, in full Georg Friedrich List  (born August 6, 1789, Reutlingen, Württemberg, Germany—died Nov. 30, 1846, Kufstein, Austria) German-U.S. economist who believed tariffs on imported goods would stimulate domestic development. List also supported the free exchange of domestic goods, and he gained prominence as founder and secretary of an association of middle and southern German industrialists who sought to abolish tariff barriers within the German states.
Largely self-educated, List advocated reforms in Germany’s civil service and promoted increased publicity of judicial procedures—actions that prompted his exile in 1825. He relocated to the United States to become editor of a German-language newspaper in Reading, Pennsylvania. In 1827 he published Outlines of American Political Economy, in which he argued that a national economy in an early stage of industrialization requires tariff protection. The costs of a tariff, he maintained, should be regarded as an investment in a nation’s future productivity.
