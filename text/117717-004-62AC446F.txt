Emma Thompson,  (born April 15, 1959, London, England) English actress and screenwriter, noted for her sophisticated and witty performances and later for her award-winning scripts.
Thompson, the daughter of actors Eric Thompson and Phyllida Law, grew up in a theatrical household that gave her an appreciation for the ridiculous. While studying English literature at the University of Cambridge, she performed with the comedy troupe Footlights. Soon after graduating in 1980, she ventured into drama, distinguishing herself opposite Kenneth Branagh in the British Broadcasting Corporation’s television miniseries Fortunes of War (1987). The couple became frequent collaborators and married in 1989 (divorced 1995). Thompson starred with Branagh in Henry V (1989), which he directed, and followed with two more Branagh-directed films, the thriller Dead Again (1991), in which the couple played dual roles, and the sentimental comedy Peter’s Friends (1992).
