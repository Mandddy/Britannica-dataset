Ko Un,  (born Aug. 1, 1933, Kunsan, North Cholla province, Japanese-occupied Korea [now South Korea]) prolific Korean poet who gained an international readership with verse informed by both his political activism in Korea and a broader concern for humanity.
Ko was born in a farming village, and his schooling took place under Japanese authorities who were intent on suppressing Korean language and culture, especially during World War II. He began writing poetry in 1945. Physically slight and emotionally sensitive, Ko as a young adult endured the deadly struggle between the communists and nationalists and the viciousness of the ensuing Korean War (1950–53). He was traumatized by the all-pervasiveness of death and the loss of friends and family in the turmoil of the period, and he lost hearing in one ear as a result of a suicide attempt. In 1952 he sought solace by becoming a Son (Zen) Buddhist monk. He continued to write and published his first book of poetry, Pian-gamseong (“Transcendental Sensibility”), in 1960.
