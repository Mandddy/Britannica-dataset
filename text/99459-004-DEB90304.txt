Sugar Bowl, postseason American collegiate gridiron football game played on New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day in New Orleans. The bowl hosts, in a rotation along with the Cotton, Fiesta, Orange, Peach, and Rose bowls, a semifinal game of the College Football Playoff, which determines college football’s Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly known as Division I-A) national champion.
The first Sugar Bowl was played in 1935, eight years after it had been conceived by Col. James M. Thomson, publisher of the New Orleans Item, and by Fred J. Digby, a columnist for that newspaper. Supporters of the game raised $30,000 by subscription, and Tulane University allowed its stadium to be used at no charge (Tulane defeated Temple University 20–14 in the inaugural game). The Sugar Bowl moved from Tulane Stadium to the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans in 1976. At that time the champion team of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) became the host team of the Sugar Bowl. From 1999 to 2006, under the original format of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS; the precursor to the College Football Playoff), the Sugar Bowl took a turn being the national championship game every four years. (Under the system that was in place from 2007 to 2013, all the BCS bowls were played annually, with a rotating national championship game added). The Sugar Bowl still has tie-ins with the SEC and the Big 12 Conference, whose champions generally play there unless the teams or the bowl is participating in the national semifinals. Annual festivities leading up to the Sugar Bowl include a regatta on Lake Pontchartrain and a few unofficial Mardi Gras-style parades.
