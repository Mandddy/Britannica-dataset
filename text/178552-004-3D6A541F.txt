Fred Zinnemann,  (born April 29, 1907, Vienna, Austria—died March 14, 1997, London, England) Austrian-born American motion-picture director whose films are distinguished by realism of atmosphere and characterization and often grounded in crises of conscience. He was nominated seven times for Academy Awards as best director, and two of his films were honoured as best picture.
Zinnemann, the son of a Jewish Viennese physician, studied music and then law at the University of Vienna (1925–27) before pursuing a career in film by studying cinematography in Paris (1927–28). After working as a cameraman for Robert Siodmak on the 1930 documentary Menschen am Sonntag (People on Sunday), Zinnemann traveled to Hollywood, where he was an extra in Lewis Milestone’s All Quiet on the Western Front (1930). Zinnemann then assisted groundbreaking documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty, an experience that would greatly influence both Zinnemann’s own feature films, which were imbued with rigorous authenticity, and Zinnemann’s character, as he was much impressed by Flaherty’s spirited independence. Zinnemann spent the next decade making documentaries, including his directorial debut (with codirector Emilio Gómez Muriel), Redes (1936; The Wave), a neorealist-like study of a Mexican fishing community that was the brainchild of renowned photographer Paul Strand.
