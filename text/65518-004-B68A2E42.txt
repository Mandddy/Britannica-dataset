L. Ron Hubbard, in full Lafayette Ronald Hubbard  (born March 13, 1911, Tilden, Nebraska, U.S.—died January 24, 1986, San Luis Obispo, California) American novelist and founder of the Church of Scientology. Hubbard grew up in Helena, Montana, and studied at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. In the 1930s and ’40s he published short stories and novels in a variety of genres, including horror and science fiction. After serving in the navy in World War II, he published Dianetics (1950), which detailed his theories of the human mind. He eventually moved away from Dianetics’ focus on the mind to a more religious approach to the human condition, which he called Scientology. After founding the Church of Scientology in 1954, Hubbard struggled to gain recognition of it as a legitimate religion and was often at odds with tax authorities and former members who accused the church of fraud and harassment. He lived many years on a yacht and remained in seclusion for his last six years.
