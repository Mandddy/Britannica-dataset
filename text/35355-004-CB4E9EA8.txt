George Macdonald,  (born Dec. 10, 1824, Huntly, Aberdeen, Scot.—died  Sept. 18, 1905, Ashtead, Surrey, Eng.) novelist of Scottish life, poet, and writer of Christian allegories of man’s pilgrimage back to God, who is remembered chiefly, however, for his allegorical fairy stories, which have continued to delight children and their elders. He became a Congregational minister, then a free-lance preacher and lecturer. In 1855 he published a poetic tragedy, Within and Without, and after that he made literature his profession. Of his literature for adults, Phantastes: A Faerie Romance for Men and Women (1858) and Lilith (1895) are good examples. Although his best known book for children is At the Back of the North Wind (1871), his best and most enduring works are The Princess and the Goblin (1872) and its sequel, The Princess and Curdie (1873).
