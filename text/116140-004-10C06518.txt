Kaskaskia River, partly navigable stream in central and southern Illinois, U.S. It rises in Champaign county near Urbana and flows southwest to enter the Mississippi River north of Chester, in Randolph county, after a course of 320 miles (515 km). About 50 miles (80 km) from its source the Kaskaskia (the name of a tribe of the Illinois confederation) flows through Lake Shelbyville, a reservoir impounded by a dam; farther downstream it passes through Carlyle Lake, the stateâ€™s largest impounded lake. The river drains some 5,800 square miles (15,000 square km) and is notorious for its variation in volume. In the late 19th century there were heavy floods at its influx into the Mississippi, which finally inundated the village of Kaskaskia, the first capital of Illinois. The shifting Mississippi adopted the bed of the Kaskaskia and cut through a peninsula to create the present Kaskaskia Island, which is the only portion of Illinois west of the Mississippi River.
