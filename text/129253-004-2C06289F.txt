Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft, former German chemical concern founded in 1863 in the Höchst quarter of Frankfurt am Main. Originally a producer of dyestuffs, it had become, by the late 20th century, one of the world’s largest producers of pharmaceuticals. In 1999 it merged with French pharmaceutical company Rhône-Poulenc to create the French-German pharmaceutical firm Aventis.
From 1863 to about 1865 the company was named Meister, Lucius &amp; Co. (after the major founders, Wilhelm Meister and Eugen Lucius); it then became Meister, Lucius &amp; Brüning (to include another founder, Adolf Brüning). In 1880 it was converted into a limited-liability company and gradually became known as Farbewerke Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft (Hoechst Dyeworks AG) after the area in which it was located. From 1925 to 1945 it was part of IG Farben, formerly the world’s largest chemical concern; the latter was dissolved by the Allies in 1945, and Farbewerke Hoechst AG was reestablished in 1951.
