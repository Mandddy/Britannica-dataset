Kiskadee,  (genus Pitangus), either of two similar New World bird species of flycatchers (family Tyrannidae, order Passeriformes), named for the call of the great kiskadee, or derby flycatcher (P. sulphuratus). The great kiskadee is reddish brown on the back, wings, and tail. The throat is white, the crown and sides of the head are black, and a white band surrounds the crown, which is surmounted by a yellow crown patch. The lesser kiskadee (P. lictor) is smaller but has similar markings.
The aggressive great kiskadee, 23 cm (9 inches) in length, is found in woodland, savannah, and wet areas from Texas and Louisiana to Argentina. Shrikelike, it drops from a perch onto such prey as frogs and insects. It also eats fruit and is known to make shallow dives for fish. Its grass nest has a domed roof. The lesser kiskadee, 19 cm (7.5 inches) long, lives from Panama to Bolivia, always along waterways. Its call is a nondescript whistle.
