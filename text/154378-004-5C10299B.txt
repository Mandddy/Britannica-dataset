Jill Abramson, in full Jill Ellen Abramson  (born March 19, 1954, New York City, New York, U.S.) American journalist who was the first female executive editor (2011–14) of The New York Times.
Abramson was raised in Manhattan, the daughter of a textile importer and his wife. She attended Harvard University, graduating in 1976 with a bachelor’s degree in history and literature. While a student, Abramson freelanced for Time magazine, and she reported on the 1976 presidential election for the publication following her graduation. After a stint on Virginia Democrat Henry Howell’s unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, she turned to political ad writing. Abramson then worked briefly for the election unit of NBC News—for which she covered the 1980 presidential election—before becoming an investigative reporter at the newly created magazine The American Lawyer in 1981. In 1986 she accepted a position as editor in chief of Legal Times magazine, which had just been purchased by The American Lawyer owner Steven Brill. Abramson remained there until 1988, when she was hired as a reporter for the Washington bureau of The Wall Street Journal. She covered the White House for the Journal and later became deputy Washington bureau chief.
