Gloucestershire, administrative, geographic, and historic county of southwestern England. It lies at the head of the River Severn estuary on the border with Wales. The administrative, geographic, and historic counties cover somewhat different areas. The administrative county comprises six districts: Cotswold, Forest of Dean, Stroud, the boroughs of Cheltenham and Tewkesbury, and the city of Gloucester, the county seat.
The geographic county encompasses these areas and the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire. Several parts of the geographic county lie outside the historic county. Along the geographic county’s eastern border, a small area west of Westonbirt lies within the historic county of Wiltshire. In the northern and northeastern parts of the geographic county, the following villages, and surrounding areas, belong to the historic county of Worcestershire: Daylesford, Evenlode, Aston Magna, Blockley, Paxford, Cutsdean, Teddington, Chaceley, Staunton, and Redmarley D’Abitot. The historic county of Gloucestershire, however, includes the following areas outside the geographic county: the historic core of Bristol and the rest of the city to the north of the River Avon (Lower, or Bristol, Avon); the parishes of Hinton, Childwickham, Ashton-under-Hill, and Kemerton in the Wychavon district of the administrative county of Worcestershire; and an area south of the River Avon (Upper, or Warwickshire, Avon), including the parishes of Welford and Upper Quinton, in the Stratford-on-Avon district of the administrative county of Worcestershire.
