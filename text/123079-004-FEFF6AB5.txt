Ramathibodi I,  (born March 10, 1315—died  1369, Ayutthaya [now in Thailand]) founder and first king (1351–69) of the Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya.
Little is known of Ramathibodi’s early career, but he is thought to have been related to the ruling family of the principality of Lop Buri and to have married the daughter of the ruler of U Thong (now Suphan Buri) in central Siam. He succeeded to the throne of U Thong in about 1347 and moved his capital 50 miles east to an island in the Chao Phraya River, where he founded the city of Dvaravati Sri Ayudhya, more commonly known as Ayutthaya, which remained the capital of Siam for more than 400 years. On March 4, 1351, Ramathibodi became king of an extensive state in the Chao Phraya valley based on Ayutthaya, Lop Buri, and Suphan Buri and quickly established Siam as a power in the affairs of the region. Maintaining amicable relations with the Thai kingdom of Sukhothai to the north, he devoted his energies to securing the region’s independence of the Cambodian kingdom of Angkor, against which he waged numerous campaigns. From the beginning of his reign he encouraged Persian and Chinese traders, and Ayutthaya’s subsequent power and prosperity rested in part on its development as an international port.
