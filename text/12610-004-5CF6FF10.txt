Crappie,  either of two freshwater North American fishes of the genus Pomoxis, family Centrarchidae (order Perciformes). Crappies are rather deep-bodied fishes that are popular as food and are prized by sport fishermen. They are native to the eastern United States but have been introduced elsewhere. They may attain a length of about 30 cm (12 inches)—rarely more—and a weight of about 2 kg (4 pounds).
The white crappie (P. annularis) generally inhabits rather warm, silty lakes and rivers. Silvery, with irregular dark markings, it is usually lighter in colour than the similar black crappie, or calico bass (P. nigromaculatus), which tends to frequent clear lakes and streams.
