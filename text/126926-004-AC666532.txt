Cole Porter, in full Cole Albert Porter  (born June 9, 1891, Peru, Ind., U.S.—died  Oct. 15, 1964, Santa Monica, Calif.) American composer and lyricist who brought a worldly élan to the American musical and who embodied in his life the sophistication of his songs.
Porter was the grandson of a millionaire speculator, and the moderately affluent circumstances of his life probably contributed to the poise and urbanity of his musical style. He began violin study at the age of six and piano at eight; he composed an operetta in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan at 10 and saw his first composition, a waltz, published a year later. As a student at Yale University (B.A., 1913), he composed about 300 songs, including “Eli,” “Bulldog,” and “Bingo Eli Yale,” and wrote college shows; later he studied at Harvard Law School (1914) and Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in music (1915–16). He made his Broadway debut with the musical comedy See America First (1916), which, however, closed after 15 performances.
