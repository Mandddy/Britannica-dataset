Nanning, Wade-Giles romanization Nan-ning, formerly (1913–45) Yongning,  city and capital of the Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi, China. The city is located in the south-central part of Guangxi on the north bank of the Yong River (the chief southern tributary of the Xi River system) and lies some 19 miles (30 km) below the confluence of the You and the Zuo rivers. The Yong River (which later becomes the Yu River) affords a good route to Guangzhou (Canton) and is navigable by shallow-draft junks and motor launches, even though it is obstructed by rapids and sandbanks. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 1,031,672; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 2,167,000.
A county seat, called Jinxing, was first established at the site in 318 ce; it also became the administrative seat of a commandery. In 589 the commandery was suppressed, and the county was renamed Xuanhua. Under the Tang dynasty (618–907) the prefecture of Yong was established there; it was garrisoned to control the non-Chinese districts in Guangxi and on the border between Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. In the mid-9th century the Tang and the Tai state of Nanzhao (in what is now western Yunnan) fought over the region, and after 861 it was briefly occupied by Nanzhao. It remained a frontier prefecture throughout the Song dynasty (960–1279), being the scene of a rebellion led by Nong Zhigao in 1052 and thereafter a garrison town. Under the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911/12) dynasties, it was a superior prefecture, Nanning.
