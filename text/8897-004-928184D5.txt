Gleb Ivanovich Uspensky,  (born Oct. 25 [Oct. 13, Old Style], 1843, Tula province, Russia—died  April 6 [March 24], 1902, St. Petersburg) Russian intellectual and writer whose realistic portrayals of peasant life did much to correct the prevalent romantic view of the Russian agricultural worker.
Uspensky studied law at the Universities of Moscow and St. Petersburg and for a time worked as a teacher. His first important work, Nravy Rasteryayevoy ulitsy (1866; “The Customs of Rasteryayevoy Street”), is a series of narrative essays about poverty and drunkenness in the suburbs of the city of Tula. For a time he was a follower of the Narodniki (radical populists), but unlike them he refused to idealize the Russian peasant, whose primitive life became the main subject of his writing, as in Vlast zemli (1882; “The Power of the Soil”). After spending most of his last 10 years as a patient in mental homes, he committed suicide.
