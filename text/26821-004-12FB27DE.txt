Ucayali River, Spanish Río Ucayali ,  headwater of the Amazon, formed by the junction of the Apurímac and Urubamba rivers in east-central Peru. The Ucayali meanders northward from this junction for about 910 miles (1,465 km) through a densely forested floodplain east of the Andes to its junction with the Marañón River, 55 miles (90 km) south-southwest of Iquitos. This confluence is considered to mark the head of the Amazon. The total length of the Ucayali and its longest tributary, the Apurímac, is 1,701 miles (2,738 km).
Shallow-draft vessels ply the river as far south as its junction with the Pachitea River, 675 miles (1,085 km) upstream from Iquitos. Along the Ucayali are small river ports, notably Pucallpa, Contamana, and Requena.
