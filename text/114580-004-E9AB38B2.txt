Terek River,  river that rises in northern Georgia and flows north and then east through Russia to empty into the Caspian Sea. It is one of the main streams draining northward from the Caucasus mountain system. The Terek is 370 miles (600 km) long and drains a basin of 16,900 square miles (43,700 square km). It rises from the glaciers of Mount Kazbek in the main Caucasus range and cuts its way northward through a series of ranges in spectacular gorges. The river enters Russia upon emerging from the northern slopes of the Caucasus, runs northward past the city of Vladikavkaz (formerly Ordzhonikidze), and makes a loop to the northwest before running eastward for the rest of its course. The major city along the Terek’s lower course is Grozny, after which the river forms the northern border of the Russian republic of Dagestan. The Terek empties into the Caspian Sea by a wide and complex delta. The river’s chief tributaries are the Ardon, Urukh, and Malka rivers on the left bank and the Sunzha on the right. The Terek River represented the southern frontier of Russian settlement in the Caucasus for much of the 19th century.
