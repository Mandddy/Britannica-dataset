Musk cucumber (Sicana odorifera), also called cassabanana, casbanan, or sikana,  perennial vine of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), native to the New World tropics and grown for its sweet-smelling edible fruit. The fruit can be eaten raw and is commonly used in jams and preserves; immature fruits are sometimes cooked as a vegetable. In temperate areas the musk cucumber can be cultivated as an ornamental annual but may not bear flowers or fruit.
The musk cucumber vine is fleshy and tall, with many tendrils. It can grow 12.5 metres (40 feet) long, with leaves up to 30 cm (12 inches) across. Both male and female flowers are yellow and borne on the same plant, but the male flowers are smaller. The oblong or cylindrical orange-red fruit may be 60 cm (24 inches) long.
