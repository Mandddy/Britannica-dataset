Television (TV), the electronic delivery of moving images and sound from a source to a receiver. By extending the senses of vision and hearing beyond the limits of physical distance, television has had a considerable influence on society. Conceived in the early 20th century as a possible medium for education and interpersonal communication, it became by mid-century a vibrant broadcast medium, using the model of broadcast radio to bring news and entertainment to people all over the world. Television is now delivered in a variety of ways: “over the air” by terrestrial radio waves (traditional broadcast TV); along coaxial cables (cable TV); reflected off of satellites held in geostationary Earth orbit (direct broadcast satellite, or DBS, TV); recorded on magnetic tape and played in videocassette recorders (VCRs); and recorded optically on digital video discs (DVDs).
The technical standards for modern television, both monochrome (black-and-white) and colour, were established in the middle of the 20th century. Improvements have been made continuously since that time, and today television technology is in the midst of considerable change. Much attention is being focused on increasing the picture resolution (high-definition television) and on changing the dimensions of the television receiver to show wide-screen pictures. In addition, the transmission of digitally encoded television signals is being instituted, with the ultimate goal of providing interactive service and possibly broadcasting multiple programs in the channel space now occupied by one program.
