The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, American screwball comedy, released in 1966, that was Don Knotts’s first feature film after he left the hit television program The Andy Griffith Show.
Knotts played nervous Luther Heggs, a newspaper typesetter who, in the hope of being promoted to reporter, agrees to spend a night in an allegedly haunted house, where 20 years earlier a husband had killed his wife and then himself. Though a relative of the couple sues Heggs for libel for confirming the ghost stories, Heggs inadvertently solves the mystery surrounding the “haunting” and uncovers the truth about the deaths, becoming a hero in the process.
