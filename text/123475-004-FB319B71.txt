Stephen I, also called Saint Stephen, Hungarian Szent István, original name Vajk  (born c. 970–975, Esztergom, Hungary—died August 15, 1038, Esztergom; canonized 1083; feast day August 16) first king of Hungary, who is considered to be the founder of the Hungarian state and one of the most-renowned figures in Hungarian history.
Stephen was a member of the Árpád dynasty and son of the supreme Magyar chieftain Géza. He was born a pagan but was baptized and reared as a Christian, and in 996 he married Gisela, daughter of Duke Henry II of Bavaria (and sister of the future Holy Roman emperor Henry II). After the death of his father (997), Stephen combated an insurrection led by his older cousin, Koppány, who claimed the throne in accordance with Árpád succession rules. Stephen defeated Koppány at Veszprém (998) and had him executed as a pagan.
