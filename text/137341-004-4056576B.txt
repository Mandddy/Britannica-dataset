Potoo (genus Nyctibius), any of seven species of solitary, nocturnal birds of the American tropics. Its name imitates the wailing cry, “po-TOO,” made by some species.
The potoos’ complex patterns of gray, black, and brown plumage resemble tree bark. During the day, the birds sleep, vertically perched and virtually indistinguishable from the dead branches they roost on. They awaken at dusk, revealing huge eyes capable of spotting moths and other flying insects in the dark. Potoos also have wide and gaping mouths for catching prey during their quick, short, and silent flights.
