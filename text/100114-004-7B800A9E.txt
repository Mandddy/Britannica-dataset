First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, The Mother Church of Christian Science, first established by Mary Baker Eddy in 1879, reestablished as an international organization by Eddy in 1892. The church building was constructed in 1895; a domed extension was added later (1903â€“06).
The Mother Church is the controlling body of Christian Science, and all local Churches of Christ, Scientist are considered branches of The Mother Church. The laws of the church, its organizations, and activities are discussed in the Manual of The Mother Church, first prepared by Eddy in 1895 and later revised by her. Eddy also provided for the establishment of a self-perpetuating Board of Directors that administers all the activities of The Mother Church. The board is composed of five members who appoint the other officers: president, first and second reader, clerk, and treasurer. Under the Board of Directors, various agencies and committees carry on the work of The Mother Church.
