Whitlow grass (genus Draba), genus of more than 300 species of plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). They are distributed primarily throughout the New World, especially in the northern temperate region and mountainous areas, though some species (formerly of the genus Erophila) are native to Europe. Whitlow grasses usually bloom in the spring and bear small white or yellow flowers with four petals. Despite their name, the plants are not true grasses.
The European common whitlow grass (Draba verna) is a low annual with small rosettes of narrow leaves, clusters of white flowers at the ends of leafless stems, and spear-shaped fruits borne on long stalks. It has naturalized in northern North America and grows on mountains, sandy ground, and rock walls. Yellow whitlow grass (D. aizoides) is a similar European species but bears yellow flowers. Twisted, or hoary, whitlow grass (D. incana) and the smaller D. norvegica have leaves on the stems and white flowers with notched petals.
