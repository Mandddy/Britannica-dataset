Otfrid, also spelled Otfried  (flourished  9th century) monk of Weissenburg in Alsace and the first German poet known by name.
Otfrid was trained in the monastery school of Fulda under Rabanus Maurus, who directed the school from 802 to 824. Otfrid’s fame rests on his Evangelienbuch (c. 870; “Book of the Gospels”), a poem of 7,416 lines, which is extant in three good contemporary manuscripts (at Vienna, Heidelberg, and Munich). It is an exceptionally valuable document, not only linguistically as the most extensive work in the South Rhine Franconian dialect of Old High German but also theologically as an introduction to early Christian thought in Germany. In German literary history it is also a milestone since it is the first poem to depart from traditional German alliterative verse and to use end rhymes.
