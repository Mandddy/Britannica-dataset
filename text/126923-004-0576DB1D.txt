Isabel Perón, in full Isabel Martínez de Perón, née María Estela Martínez Cartas  (born Feb. 4, 1931, La Rioja, Arg.) president of Argentina 1974–76, third wife of President Juan Perón.
She was born to a lower-middle-class family, acquired the name Isabel (her saint’s name) on her Roman Catholic confirmation, and adopted the name when she became a dancer. She met Perón in either 1955 or 1956 and, giving up her career in show business, became his personal secretary, accompanying him in exile to Madrid, where they were married in 1961. She visited Argentina several times in the 1960s and early ’70s, building support for Perón. When Perón finally returned to Argentina to run for president in 1973, Isabel was chosen as his running mate on the suggestion of Perón’s close adviser José López Rega. Perón’s illness several times elevated her to the position of acting president, and when he died on July 1, 1974, she succeeded him in office, becoming the world’s first woman president.
