Hoagy Carmichael, byname of Hoagland Howard Carmichael   (born November 22, 1899, Bloomington, Indiana, U.S.—died December 27, 1981, Rancho Mirage, California) American composer, singer, self-taught pianist, and actor who wrote several of the most highly regarded popular standards in American music.
Carmichael’s father was an itinerant electrician, and his mother earned extra money for the family as a pianist for dances and silent movies; from her, Carmichael absorbed the basics of playing the piano. He was strongly influenced by ragtime music and by the music he heard from black families and churches in his neighbourhood. As a teenager, he made every effort to hear and play as much jazz as possible, studying in Indianapolis, Indiana, with pianist Reginald DuValle and traveling to Chicago to hear Louis Armstrong. While studying at Indiana University in Bloomington (LL.B., 1926), Carmichael led a small jazz band that had some success playing for college dances throughout the Midwest. In the spring of 1924, Carmichael became friends with Bix Beiderbecke after engaging the young cornetist to play for several fraternity parties. Carmichael’s first composition, “Free Wheeling,” was retitled “Riverboat Shuffle” when recorded by Beiderbecke and his band, the Wolverines, later the same year; the recording subsequently became a jazz classic.
