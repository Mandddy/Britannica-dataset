Innocent II, original name Gregorio Papareschi   (born , Rome—died  Sept. 24, 1143, Rome) pope from 1130 to 1143.
A cardinal by 1116, Innocent was appointed in 1122 by Pope Calixtus II as one of the ambassadors who drafted the Concordat of Worms, an agreement ending disputes between the pope and the Holy Roman emperor Henry V over the right of investiture; i.e., whether the papacy or temporal rulers had the right to install bishops and other clergy. In 1123 Gregorio became papal emissary in France. On the night of Pope Honorius II’s death (Feb. 13, 1130), a minority elected Gregorio (who took the name of Innocent II), while a majority soon after elected Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni as Anacletus II. Innocent was hastily consecrated, but by June 1130 Anacletus forced him to flee to France. The vindication of Innocent’s title owes its success to Archbishop St. Norbert of Magdeburg, Saxony, and to Abbot St. Bernard of Clairvaux, Champagne. Bernard swayed the French Church and also King Henry I of England to Innocent’s side. Norbert won over the German Church (October 1130) and the German king Lothar II/III.
