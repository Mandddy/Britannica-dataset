Ricky Skaggs, byname of Rickie Lee Skaggs  (born July 18, 1954, Cordell, Kentucky, U.S.) American mandolin and fiddle virtuoso, singer, and music producer who played a leading role in the New Traditionalist movement of the 1980s by adapting bluegrass music’s instrumentation and historically conscious sensibility to mainstream country music.
Skaggs was a child prodigy on the mandolin, and by age seven he had already played onstage with bluegrass founder Bill Monroe and appeared on the Grand Ole Opry and on the television show of bluegrass legends (Lester) Flatt &amp; (Earl) Scruggs. Within just a few more years, he had also become extraordinarily proficient on guitar and fiddle. Skaggs’s professional career began in 1970, when as teenagers he and singing partner Keith Whitley joined the band of another bluegrass pioneer, Ralph Stanley.
