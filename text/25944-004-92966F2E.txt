Edward Vernon Rickenbacker, byname Eddie Rickenbacker   (born Oct. 8, 1890, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.—died  July 23, 1973, Zürich) pilot, industrialist, and the most celebrated U.S. air ace of World War I.
Rickenbacker developed an early interest in internal-combustion engines and automobiles, and, by the time the United States entered World War I, he was one of the country’s top three racing drivers. He entered the army in 1917 as a driver attached to General John J. Pershing’s staff and drove a car for Colonel William (“Billy”) Mitchell, the noted advocate of tactical air power.
