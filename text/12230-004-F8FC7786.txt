William Drummond,  (born Dec. 13, 1585, Hawthornden, near Edinburgh, Scot.—died  Dec. 4, 1649, Hawthornden) first notable poet in Scotland to write deliberately in English. He also was the first to use the canzone, a medieval Italian or Provençal metrical form, in English verse.
Drummond studied at Edinburgh and spent a few years in France, ostensibly studying law at Bourges and Paris. On the death of his father, first laird of Hawthornden, in 1610, he settled down on his Hawthornden estate, leaving law for literature and devoting himself to the life of a cultured and rather detached man of means. There was a certain natural reticence in Drummond’s character, but he had many friends, including the poets Michael Drayton and Sir William Alexander and the playwright Ben Jonson.
