Seven Samurai, Japanese Shichinin no samurai,  Japanese action film, released in 1954, that was cowritten and directed by Kurosawa Akira and is acclaimed as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.
Seven Samurai is set at the end of the 16th century and centres on an impoverished Japanese village that is at the mercy of a marauding gang of bandits. The bandits have ransacked the village before, stealing its crops, but, before striking again, they decide to wait until the next harvest is complete. Determined to stop the assault, the village hires—in exchange for food—a disparate group of hungry samurai to help stave off the attack. The villagers are wary of their protectors, because Japan’s farming and warrior castes were culturally forbidden to intermingle and because of the samurai reputation for violence and sexual assault. Their protectors, however, prove valiant and honest, ultimately saving the village. The film ends on an introspective note: while the villagers happily celebrate their victory and the defeat of their oppressors, the three surviving samurai wonder what they have won.
