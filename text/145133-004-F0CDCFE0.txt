Citizens band radio, also called Cb Radio,  short-range radio voice communications system used chiefly by private individuals in motor vehicles, homes, offices, and other locations where wireless telephone service is unavailable. A typical CB radio consists of a combined transmitter-receiver (a transceiver) and an antenna. In the United States 40 channels, at frequencies from 26.965 to 27.225 megahertz or in the UHF range of 460 to 470 megahertz, have been allocated to CB radio. A federal limitation of power (4 watts) and practical limitations of antenna height restrict the range of CB radios in motor vehicles to about 25 km (15 miles) and those in fixed locations to no more than 50 km (30 miles).
CB radio originated in the United States during the 1940s, when the Federal Communications Commission created the Citizens Radio Service for regulating remote-control units and mobile radiotelephones. The commission made CB radio a special class of the service in 1958 and permitted its use as a hobby in 1975. Several other nations, including Canada, Jamaica, and Germany, also allow CB communications.
