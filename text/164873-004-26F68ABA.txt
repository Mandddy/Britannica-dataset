Sven Anders Hedin,  (born February 19, 1865, Stockholm, Sweden—died November 26, 1952, Stockholm) Swedish explorer who led through Central Asia a series of expeditions that resulted in important archaeological and geographical findings.
Travels in the Caucasus, Persia, and Mesopotamia when he was 20 and an appointment as an interpreter for the Swedish-Norwegian mission to Nāser al-Dīn, shah of Iran (1890), marked the beginning of Hedin’s life of exploration. In 1891 he visited Khorāsān (northeastern Persia) and Russian Turkestan, and between 1893 and 1898 he crossed Asia to Beijing by way of the Urals, the Pamir range, and Lop Nor (Lop Lake), in western China. Following the Tarim River through western China, he explored the Gobi (desert) from 1899 to 1902. He was the first to explore the Trans-Himalaya mountain range of Tibet and to prepare a detailed map of the country (1905–08).
