River Ouse, also called Great Ouse,  river in England, draining the East Midlands at the Fens. It rises 5 miles (8 km) west of Brackley, Northamptonshire, and flows past Buckingham, Bedford, Huntington, and St. Ives to Earith and thence via the Fens to The Wash, a shallow inlet of the North Sea. For the first 100 miles (160 km), the river follows an irregular, meandering course, its gradient falling from 20 feet per mile (4 metres per kilometre) above Buckingham to 2 feet per mile (0.4 metre per kilometre) toward Earith. From Earith to its mouth, a distance of 35 miles (56 km), the course is almost entirely artificial, having been straightened and having had its flow controlled by sluices. The average gradient there is very slight. Parts of the upper valley are followed by the Grand Union Canal. Locks make the river navigable upstream to Bedford. Coarse fishing and gravel extraction are important.
The river is sometimes called the Great Ouse, probably to distinguish it from its tributary the Little Ouse.
