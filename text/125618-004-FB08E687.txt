Leopard lizard, any of three species of Gambelia in the lizard family Crotaphytidae. The long-nosed leopard lizard (G. wislizenii) is large and spotted; it inhabits arid and semi-arid areas in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The blunt-nosed leopard lizard (G. sila) occurs only in the deserts of central California; Cope’s leopard lizard (G. copeii) is found from southern California in the United States to southern Baja California in Mexico.
Leopard lizards feed upon a variety of insects, seeds, and flowers as well as on small mammals and other lizards. When disturbed they can run rapidly across open habitat using only the hind feet. Leopard lizards lay 2–10 white-shelled eggs and exhibit no signs of parental care. (See collared lizard.)
