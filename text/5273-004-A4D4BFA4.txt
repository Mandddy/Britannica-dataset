Zebra swallowtail butterfly (Eurytides marcellus), species of butterfly in the family Papilionidae (order Lepidoptera) that has wing patterns reminiscent of a zebraâ€™s stripes, with a series of longitudinal black bands forming a pattern on a greenish white or white background. There are several generations in a single year, spring broods being rather smaller than summer broods. Adult forms that emerge at different seasons vary considerably in their markings. The span of the forewings is 6 to 9 cm (2.5 to 3.5 inches), and the hindwings bear tails that are 15 to 25 mm (0.6 to 1 inch) long. The principal food plant of the larvae is the pawpaw.
Previously this species has been placed in the genera Iphiclides, Graphium, and Papilio. This species closely resembles the European scarce swallowtail, I. podalirius.
