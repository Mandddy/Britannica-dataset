Steeplechase, in horse racing, a race over jumps or obstacles. Although dating back to Xenophon (4th century bc), it derives its name from impromptu races by fox hunters in 18th-century Ireland over natural country in which church steeples served as course landmarks. It differs from hurdle racing, in which the barriers or hurdles are portable. Steeplechasing was long a favourite sport of cavalry officers. It is popular in England, France, and Ireland and to a lesser extent in the United States.
Because of the stamina that is required, mature horses are preferred, and racing through age 10 and beyond is not uncommon. Many steeplechasers are “half-bred,” the term applied to any horse that is not a pure Thoroughbred. The most famous steeplechase race is the Grand National held annually at Aintree, near Liverpool, Eng., over a distance of 4 miles 855 yards (7,180 m.) with 30 or so fences. It has been won several times by horses carrying 175 pounds (79 kg). Other steeplechase events include the Irish Grand National and the Grand Steeplechase de Paris. An American steeplechase, the Maryland Hunt Cup, was first run in 1894 in Glyndon, Md. The steeplechase appears in the Olympic Games as part of the three-day event in equestrian competition.
