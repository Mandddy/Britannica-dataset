Torreya, a genus of approximately six species of ornamental trees and shrubs in the yew family (Taxaceae), distributed in localized areas of the western and southeastern United States, China, and Japan. Torreyas have persistent, linear, bristle-pointed leaves, arranged roughly in two rows, or ranks. The leaves are slightly convex and lustrous above; on the underside, two sunken, waxy-appearing bands parallel the midrib. Leaves, branchlets, and wood are often aromatic or foul scented, especially when bruised. Male and female flowers are borne on separate trees or on different branches of the same tree. Each large seed is completely surrounded by a fleshy covering, or aril. The California nutmeg, Japanese torreya, and stinking yew are the commonly known ornamentals; the other three species are Chinese trees with local distributions, rarely found in cultivation.
