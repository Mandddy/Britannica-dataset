Blow-Up, British-Italian thriller, released in 1966, that was the first full-length English-language film of Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni. It is one of the seminal films of the 1960s “mod” era.
Blow-Up, which was inspired by a short story by Spanish writer Julio Cortázar, features David Hemmings as a hip and successful but bored and nihilistic fashion photographer. While wandering through a park, he photographs a young woman (played by Vanessa Redgrave) and her lover. Redgrave follows him home, demanding the film, which intensifies his desire to see what he has captured. Upon developing the pictures, he finds that he may have recorded a murder in progress.
