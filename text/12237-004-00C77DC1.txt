Pierre Drieu La Rochelle,  (born Jan. 3, 1893, Paris, France—died  March 16, 1945, Paris) French writer of novels, short stories, and political essays whose life and works illustrate the malaise common among European youth after World War I.
Drieu, the brilliant son of a middle-class family, attended the École des Sciences Politiques with the intention of entering diplomatic service. His plans, however, were interrupted by World War I, in which he fought and was wounded. Like many others of his generation, he emerged from the war disillusioned, and he began a lifelong search for a sound moral and philosophical approach to life. He briefly became involved in the Surrealist movement. Characteristic novels of this period include his first novel, L’Homme couvert de femmes (1925; “The Man Covered With Women”), and Le Feu follet (1931; The Fire Within, or Will o’ the Wisp; filmed by Louis Malle in 1963). Le Feu follet is the story of the last hours in the life of a young bourgeois Parisian addict who kills himself. In one fashion or another, the subject of decadence and the general loss of moral fibre in postwar French society was to remain a subject of major concern throughout his life.
