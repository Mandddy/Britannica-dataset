Amasis, also called Ahmose II  (flourished 6th century bce) king (reigned 570–526 bce) of the 26th dynasty (664–525 bce; see ancient Egypt: The Late period [664–332 bce]) of ancient Egypt, a general who seized the throne during a revolt against King Apries. The account of the 5th-century-bce Greek historian Herodotus reveals Amasis as a shrewd and opportunistic ruler who, while promoting Greek trade with Egypt, strictly regulated it.
In 570, after Apries’s unsuccessful campaign against Cyrene (in modern Libya), the Egyptian troops mutinied, and, when Amasis was sent to pacify them, the mutineers proclaimed him king. In the ensuing civil war the Egyptians under his command defeated an invasion by Apries, who was supported by the Babylonian king Nebuchadrezzar II. Amasis killed Apries in battle but later gave him a royal burial.
