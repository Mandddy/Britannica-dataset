Duchy of Warsaw, also called Grand Duchy of Warsaw, French Duché or Grand-Duché de Varsovie, Polish Księstwo or Warszawskie (1807–15),  independent Polish state created by Napoleon. It became a focal point of efforts to restore the Polish nation, which had been destroyed by the Partitions of Poland made by Russia, Prussia, and Austria in 1772, 1793, and 1795.
Established by the Treaties of Tilsit (July 7 and 9, 1807) after the Poles had helped Napoleon defeat Prussia, the duchy consisted originally of the major portion of the central Polish provinces that had been absorbed by Prussia in 1793 and 1795. Exceptions were Danzig (Gdańsk), which became a free city; the district of Białystok, which was ceded to Russia; and the region of the Noteć (German Netze) river, acquired by Prussia in 1772, which was added to the duchy. In 1809 the duchy was increased by the territory that Austria had seized in the Third Partition.
