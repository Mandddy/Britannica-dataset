Damophon,  (flourished 2nd century bce) ancient Greek sculptor of Messene, who executed many statues at Messene, Megalopolis, Aegium, and other cities of the Peloponnese. Soon after 183 bce he repaired Phidiasâ€™s sculpture of Zeus at Olympia, which had been damaged by an earthquake. Considerable fragments, including three colossal heads from a group sculpted by Damophon and representing Demeter, her daughter Despoina, Artemis, and the giant Anytus, were found on the site of Lykosoura in Arcadia, where there was a temple of Despoina. The garment of Despoina is decorated with reliefs. A coin shows the statue with two figures standing, two seated.
