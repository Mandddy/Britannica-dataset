Antyeshti, Hindu funeral rites, varying according to the caste and religious sect of the deceased but generally involving cremation followed by disposal of the ashes in a sacred river. Antyeshti rites are the final sacraments (samskaras) in a series that ideally begins at the moment of conception and is performed at each important stage of life.
At the approach of death, relatives and Brahmans (priests) are summoned, mantras (sacred formulas) and sacred texts are recited, and ceremonial gifts are prepared. After death the body is removed as soon as possible to the cremation grounds, which are usually located on the banks of a river. The eldest son of the deceased and the officiating priest perform the final cremation rites. For 10 days thereafter, the mourners—the immediate family members—are considered impure and are subject to certain taboos. During this period they perform rites intended to provide the naked soul of the deceased with a new spiritual body with which it may pass on to the next life. Ceremonies include the setting out of milk and water and the offering of rice balls. At a prescribed date, the bones are collected and disposed of by burial or by immersion in a river. Rites honouring the dead, called shraddha, continue to be performed by the survivors at specified times.
