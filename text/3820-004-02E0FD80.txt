Nicholas Rowe,  (born June 20, 1674, Little Barford, Bedfordshire, England—died December 6, 1718, London) English writer who was the first to attempt a critical edition of the works of Shakespeare. Rowe succeeded Nahum Tate as poet laureate in 1715 and was also the foremost 18th-century English tragic dramatist, doing much to assist the rise of domestic tragedy.
Rowe was called to the bar in 1696 and, an ardent Whig, afterward held several minor government posts. His early plays, The Ambitious Step-Mother (1700) and Tamerlane (1702), are reminiscent of John Dryden’s heroic drama in their pomp and bluster but contain elements presaging the spirit of sentiment that characterizes The Fair Penitent (1703) and later works. This latter play is of some literary significance; its hero, Lothario, besides giving a new word for an attractive rake to the English language, was apparently the prototype of Lovelace, the hero of Samuel Richardson’s novel Clarissa. Rowe composed The Tragedy of Jane Shore (1714) in imitation of Shakespeare’s style, as he did The Tragedy of the Lady Jane Grey (1715). His only comedy, The Biter (1704), was a failure.
