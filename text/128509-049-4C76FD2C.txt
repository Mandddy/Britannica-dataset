Scale worm, any member of the superfamily Aphroditoidea (class Polychaeta, phylum Annelida), a group of widely distributed free-moving, segmented marine worms that possess dorsal scales. Scale worms range in size from 0.5 to 25 cm (about 0.2 to 10 inches). The superfamily is made up of several dozen genera and also includes the sea mouse, Aphrodita.
The somewhat arched back of the scale worm is covered with flattened pairs of overlapping scales (elytra). A proboscis, or snout, which can be extended, has soft, fingerlike projections and four horny jaws.
