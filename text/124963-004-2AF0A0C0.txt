Edith Abbott,  (born Sept. 26, 1876, Grand Island, Neb., U.S.—died July 28, 1957, Grand Island) American social worker, educator, and author who was instrumental in promoting the professional practice and academic discipline of social work in the United States.
Edith Abbott was the older sister of Grace Abbott, who would serve as chief of the United States Children’s Bureau from 1921 to 1934. Both sisters were influenced by their mother’s concern for the downtrodden, her pacifism, and her belief in equal rights for women. Edith graduated in 1893 from Brownell Hall, a girls’ boarding school in Omaha, but when the family could not afford to send her to college, she began teaching high school in Grand Island. Determined to get a college education nonetheless, she took correspondence courses and attended summer sessions until she was able to afford full-time matriculation at the University of Nebraska, which awarded her a degree in 1901. After an additional two years as a teacher, Abbott attended the University of Chicago in economics (Ph.D., 1905).
