Mike Wallace, original name Myron Leon Wallace  (born May 9, 1918, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.—died April 7, 2012, New Canaan, Connecticut) American television interviewer and reporter. After graduating from the University of Michigan (1939), Wallace worked as an announcer and newscaster on radio, delving into various programs including talk shows, quiz shows, serials, and the news. He served as a naval communications officer during World War II and was subsequently hired as a radio reporter in Chicago. In the 1950s he began to work on television, hosting several television quiz shows. Wallace joined CBS as a reporter in 1963 and was coeditor of the long-running 60 Minutes from its first program in 1968. He was a regular contributor until 2006, though he periodically conducted interviews for the show thereafter. Noted for his aggressive, bruising style (which led some of his guests to experience “Mike fright”), he traveled the world interviewing some of the most famous and powerful figures, and he won numerous Emmy Awards. Wallace wrote several books, including the memoir Between You and Me (2005; cowritten with Gary Paul Gates).
