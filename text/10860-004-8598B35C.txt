Robert Maynard Hutchins,  (born Jan. 17, 1899, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died May 14, 1977, Santa Barbara, Calif.) American educator and university and foundation president, who criticized overspecialization and sought to balance the college curriculum and to maintain the Western intellectual tradition.
After attending Oberlin College in Ohio (1915–17), he served in the ambulance service of the U.S. and Italian armies during World War I. He graduated from Yale University (A.B., 1921) and Yale Law School (LL.B., 1925), where he was named dean in 1927. Two years later, at the age of 30, he became president of the University of Chicago; he remained at Chicago until 1951, the last six years as chancellor. A controversial administrator, Hutchins reorganized the university’s departments for undergraduate and graduate study into four divisions. His Chicago Plan for undergraduates encouraged liberal education at earlier ages and measured achievement by comprehensive examination rather than by classroom time served. He introduced study of the Great Books. At the same time, Hutchins argued about the purposes of higher education, deploring undue emphasis on nonacademic pursuits (Chicago abandoned intercollegiate gridiron football in 1939) and criticizing the tendency toward specialization and vocationalism. After his departure, however, the university abandoned most of his reforms and returned to the educational practices of other major American universities.
