St. Moritz 1948 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in St. Moritz, Switz., that took place Jan. 30â€“Feb. 8, 1948. The St. Moritz Games were the fifth occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
After an absence of 12 years as a result of World War II, Olympic competition returned. The Games, however, felt the effects of the war, as countries were unable to properly equip their teams, forcing athletes to improvise. A shortage of money and the imposition of travel restrictions resulted in a lack of spectators. Nonetheless, St. Moritz, which (because of Swiss wartime neutrality) was undamaged by fighting, put forth a well-organized Games. Even the weather, which had caused major disruptions at the previous Games in St. Moritz (1928), cooperated, and only minor reschedulings occurred.
