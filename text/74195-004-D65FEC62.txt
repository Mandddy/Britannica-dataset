Pfizer, Inc., one of the world’s largest research-based pharmaceutical and biomedical companies, dedicated to discovering, developing, manufacturing, and marketing prescription medications for both humans and animals. Headquarters are in New York City.
Pfizer was founded in Brooklyn, New York, in 1849 as Charles Pfizer &amp; Company by the German chemist and entrepreneur Charles Pfizer and his cousin Charles Erhart, a confectioner. The company, then a fine-chemicals business, was financed with a $2,500 loan from Pfizer’s father. Pfizer and Erhart achieved immediate success with their first product, a flavourful form of santonin—an anthelmintic drug used to treat intestinal worms, a common affliction in the mid-1800s. The subsequent demand for disinfectants, preservatives, and painkillers during the American Civil War (1861–65) doubled the company’s revenue and allowed for its expansion. In the late 1800s its citric acid production soared with the increasing popularity of cola drinks, producing decades of growth for the company.
