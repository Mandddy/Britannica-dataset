Bullhead, also called horned pout,  any of several North American freshwater catfishes of the genus Ameiurus (Ictalurus of some authorities) and the family Ictaluridae. Bullheads are related to the channel catfish (I. punctatus) and other large North American species but have squared, rather than forked, tails and are generally less than 30 centimetres (12 inches) long. Bullheads are valued as food and sport fishes. The black bullhead (A. melas) is found in the Mississippi valley, the yellow and brown bullheads (A. natalis and A. nebulosus) east of the Rocky Mountains, and the flat bullhead (A. platycephalus) in the coastal streams between North Carolina and Florida.
The name bullhead is sometimes also applied to sculpins and sea poachers.
