American professional baseball player who was an outstanding hitter and fielder and one of the best all-round players in the history of the game.
DiMaggio was the son of Italian immigrants who made their living by fishing. He quit school at 14 and at 17 joined his brother Vincent and began playing baseball with the minor league San Francisco Seals. (In addition to Vincent, who would go on to play for several major league teams, including the Pittsburgh Pirates, a younger DiMaggio brother, Dominic, played for the Boston Red Sox.) Joe’s contract with San Francisco was purchased by the New York Yankees, and he was brought up to the major leagues in 1936. In his rookie season with the Yankees he batted .323 during the regular season and .346 against the New York Giants during the World Series.
