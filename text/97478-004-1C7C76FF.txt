Mictlantecuhtli, Aztec god of the dead, usually portrayed with a skull face. With his wife, Mictecac√≠huatl, he ruled Mictlan, the underworld. The souls of those whose manner of death failed to call them to various paradises (i.e., for those dead by war, sacrifice, childbirth, drowning, lightning, and certain diseases) made a four-year journey, fraught with trials, through the nine hells of Mictlan. In the last, where Mictlantecuhtli lived, they disappeared or found rest.
