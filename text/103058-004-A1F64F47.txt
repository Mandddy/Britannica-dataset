Juliette Binoche,  (born March 9, 1964, Paris, France) French actress, widely regarded as one of film’s most-respected performers for the intelligence she brought to her complex and varied roles.
Binoche’s father was a sculptor and a theatre director, and her mother was a teacher and an actress. After completing her general education, she studied acting at the Paris Conservatoire and received private instruction from Vera Gregh, a renowned teacher of film acting. During the late 1970s Binoche appeared onstage in Paris, and in the first half of the 1980s she acted in small film roles and on French television. Her first breakthrough came through renowned director Jean-Luc Godard, who wrote into the screenplay of his Je vous salue, Marie (1985; Hail Mary) a part expressly for her.
