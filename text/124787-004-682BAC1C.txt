Trading stamp, printed stamps given as a premium by retailers to customers and redeemable for cash or merchandise from the trading stamp company when accumulated in specified amounts. Retailers sponsor trading stamp programs as a means of building customer loyalty. The retailer purchases the stamps from the trading stamp company at a cost based on a small percentage of total sales.
Trading stamps appeared in the United States and Great Britain in the late 19th century. The most popular trading stamp program in the United States, S&amp;H Green Stamps, was sponsored by Sperry &amp; Hutchinson. The company started operations in 1896 and flourished from the 1930s through the 1960s. In 1964 the S&amp;H Green Stamp catalog became the largest single publication distributed in the United States. Trading stamp programs were also popular in Great Britain and Japan during the 1960s.
