Rajm, (
        Arabic: “stoning”) in Islam, the ritual casting of stones at the devil during the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca), a pre-Islamic Arabian religious custom retained by the Prophet Muhammad. Historically, Muslim legalists did not agree on the number of stones to be cast or on the exact time for this rite among the other pilgrimage rites; Muhammad himself reportedly stated that there was no harm in disregarding the traditional (pre-Islamic) order of the pilgrimage ceremonies, probably to avoid reconciling differing tribal practices already in existence. Most Muslims, however, attempt to imitate the pilgrimage as completed by Muhammad. On the 10th day of the Dhū al-Ḥijjah, the month of the hajj, they each throw seven small stones at Jamrat al-ʿAqabah—one of three stone towers (jamrahs) located in the valley of Minā—which is identified by tradition as the site where the patriarch Abraham stoned Satan. On the 11th, 12th, and 13th of the month, the ritual is repeated at all three jamrahs; each is pelted with seven stones every noon for the three days.
Stones for the rajm should be found in their natural state, rather than broken from larger rocks; precious stones and stones made of gold and silver are forbidden as wasteful and dangerous. The stones may not be thrown violently and should be not much larger than a lentil so that no harm is caused if someone is struck by accident. Any stones that are collected but not used on the pilgrimage must subsequently be buried, for once they reach the sacred shrine in Mecca, they assume a sacred character.
