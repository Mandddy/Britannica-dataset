Alexandros Papagos,  (born Dec. 9, 1883, Athens, Greece—died  Oct. 4, 1955, Athens) soldier and statesman who late in life organized a political party and became premier (1952–55) of Greece.
Papagos, commissioned in 1906, saw his first service in the Balkan Wars (1912–13). He took part in the Greek invasion of Turkey (1919–22), won promotion to the rank of major general (1927), and became corps commander and minister of war (1935); the following year he was named chief of staff. Although at the time of the Italian attack on Greece (October 1940), he conducted, as commander in chief, a passive, basically defensive campaign, he nonetheless succeeded in driving the Italians back into Albania. His defenses soon crumbled, however, under the later German onslaught (April 1941), and he was taken to Germany as a hostage. Liberated in 1945, he directed postwar operations in Greece against communist guerrillas and was appointed field marshal in 1949.
