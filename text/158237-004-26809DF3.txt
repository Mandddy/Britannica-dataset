Julianne Moore, byname of Julie Anne Smith  (born December 3, 1960, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, U.S.) American actress known for her exacting and sympathetic portrayals of women at odds with their surroundings, often in films that examined social issues.
Smith was the eldest of three children; her American father was a military lawyer and judge, and her Scottish immigrant mother was a homemaker who later in life became a psychiatric social worker. She earned a bachelor’s degree in acting from Boston University in 1983 and moved to New York City soon thereafter. Smith assumed the stage name Julianne Moore, the latter portion of which was her father’s middle name, because all variations of her own name were already registered with the Actors’ Equity Association. She appeared in several plays and television programs before beginning a three-year arc on the soap opera As the World Turns in 1985. Her portrayals of a psychologist and, eventually, her half sister, earned her a Daytime Emmy Award in 1988. Meanwhile, she had appeared in Caryl Churchill’s Serious Money at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater (1987) and trod the boards as Ophelia in a production of Hamlet (1988) staged by the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She returned to the Public Theater in two Churchill one-acts—staged as Ice Cream with Hot Fudge—in 1990.
