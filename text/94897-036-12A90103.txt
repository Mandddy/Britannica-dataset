Mizar, also called Zeta Ursae Majoris,  first star found (by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli in 1650) to be a visual binary—i.e., to consist of two optically distinguishable components revolving around each other. Later, each of the visual components was determined to be a spectroscopic binary; Mizar is actually a quadruple star. Apparent visual magnitudes of the two visual components are 2.27 and 3.95. Set in the middle of the Big Dipper’s handle, Mizar (from Arabic: “Veil” or “Cloak”) makes a visual double with the fainter Alcor (from Arabic: “Faint One”). The two are 1.2 light-years apart and may be gravitationally bound to each other. The ability to separate the dim star Alcor from Mizar 0.2° away with the unaided eye may have been regarded by the Arabs (and others) as a test of good vision.
