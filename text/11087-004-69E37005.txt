Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles,  (born September 20, 1759, Paris, France—died April 5, 1794, Paris) nobleman and magistrate who became a member of the Committee of Public Safety that ruled Revolutionary France during the period of the Jacobin dictatorship (1793–94).
Hérault de Séchelles came from an ancient and distinguished noble family. Wealthy, handsome, and witty, he was appointed attorney to King Louis XVI in 1777, and in 1785 he was made attorney general to the Parlement of Paris, one of the high courts of justice. Nevertheless, upon the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, Hérault joined the crowd that stormed the Bastille (July 14). In 1791 he was elected a deputy to the Revolution’s Legislative Assembly. Hérault joined the Jacobin Club and sat with the Montagnards (as the Jacobin deputies were called) in the National Convention, which succeeded the Legislative Assembly in September 1792.
