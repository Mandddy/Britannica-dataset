The university was chartered in 1858 as Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm. Made a land-grant institution in 1864, the college was one of the first schools to benefit from the Morrill Act of 1862. Students were in attendance in the fall of 1868, but formal instruction did not begin until early 1869. The name was changed to Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1898, and it took its current name in 1959. Iowa State was coeducational from its origin. The first electronic digital computer was built there (c. 1939), and it was the first state institution to found a veterinary school (1879). Points of interest include the 50-bell Stanton Memorial Carillon, a series of murals by painter Grant Wood in the university’s library, and a number of works by sculptor Christian Petersen. The Farm House Museum (1860) is the restored home of the university’s first two presidents. Notable alumni include Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui, feminist leader Carrie Chapman Catt, and scientist George Washington Carver.
