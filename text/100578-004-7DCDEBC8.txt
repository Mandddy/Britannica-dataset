Tonle Sap, Khmer Bœng Tônlé Sab,  natural floodplain reservoir, central Cambodia. The lake is drained during the dry season by the Sab River (Tônlé Sab) across the Véal Pôc plain southeastward to the Mekong River. Called by the French Grand Lac (“Great Lake”), the lake is fed by numerous erratic tributaries and also by the Srêng and Sên rivers, which are perennial northern tributaries. During the June-to-November monsoonal regime, the swollen Mekong reverses the southeastward flow of the Sab River, which increases Tonle Sap’s area from about 1,050 square miles (2,700 square km) to about 4,000 square miles (10,360 square km); its depth also increases from 3–10 feet (0.9–3 m) to 30–45 feet (9–14 m), permitting vessels with 9 feet (3 m) of draft to navigate it up through the various tributaries, on which are situated the towns of Kâmpóng Thum (Kompong Thom), Siĕmréab, Bătdâmbâng (Battambang), and Poŭthĭsăt (Pursat). During the rainy season the lake’s width increases from about 22 miles (35 km) to 65 miles (105 km). At low water it is little more than a reed-infested swamp, with channels for fishing craft. The lake, the largest freshwater body in Southeast Asia, supports a large carp-breeding and carp-harvesting industry, with numerous floating fishing villages inhabited largely by ethnic Vietnamese. The fermented and salted fish are staples of the Cambodian diet. UNESCO designated Tonle Sap a World Network Biosphere Reserve in 1997.
