Eduard Friedrich Mörike,  (born Sept. 8, 1804, Ludwigsburg, Württemberg [Germany]—died  June 4, 1875, Stuttgart) one of Germany’s greatest lyric poets.
After studying theology at Tübingen (1822–26), Mörike held several curacies before becoming, in 1834, pastor of Cleversulzbach, the remote Württemberg village immortalized in Der alte Turmhahn, where inhabitants and pastor are seen through the whimsical but percipient eyes of an old weathercock. All his life Mörike suffered from psychosomatic illnesses, which were possibly intensified by an unconscious conflict between his humanist aspirations and his church dogmas. When only 39, Mörike retired on a pension, but after his marriage to Margarete von Speeth in 1851, he supplemented his pension by lecturing on German literature at a girls’ school in Stuttgart. After many years of rich literary achievement, the tensions caused by Margarete’s jealousy of Clara, Mörike’s sister who lived with them, almost killed his creative urge. Mörike spent most of his last two years with Clara and his younger daughter and was separated from Margarete until shortly before his death.
