Extratropical cyclone, also called wave cyclone or midlatitude cyclone,  a type of storm system formed in middle or high latitudes, in regions of large horizontal temperature variations called frontal zones. Extratropical cyclones present a contrast to the more violent cyclones or hurricanes of the tropics, which form in regions of relatively uniform temperatures.
According to the polar-front theory, extratropical cyclones develop when a wave forms on a frontal surface separating a warm air mass from a cold air mass. As the amplitude of the wave increases, the pressure at the centre of disturbance falls, eventually intensifying to the point at which a cyclonic circulation begins. The decay of such a system results when the cold air from the north in the Northern Hemisphere, or from the south in the Southern Hemisphere, on the western side of such a cyclone sweeps under all of the warm tropical air of the system so that the entire cyclone is composed of the cold air mass. This action is known as occlusion.
