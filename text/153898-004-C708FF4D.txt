Quetico Provincial Park,  wilderness park, southwestern Ontario, Canada, west of Lake Superior and adjoining the U.S. border. Established in 1913, the park has an area of 1,832 sq mi (4,744 sq km). The region was formerly the site of a major eastâ€“west route used by Indians, explorers, and traders. Parts of the 19th-century Dawson Trail, used by immigrants to reach the western prairies, can still be seen there. Access to Quetico is by canoe from points on its perimeter, and the only means of travel within the park is by its more than 1,000 lakes and waterways. The park is the site of Indian pictographs. The abundant wildlife includes black bear, moose, wolf, and white-tailed deer; fishes include lake trout, northern pike, pickerel (walleye), bass, and sturgeon.
