Earl Hines, in full Earl Kenneth Hines, byname Fatha  (born Dec. 28, 1903, Duquesne, Pa., U.S.—died April 22, 1983, Oakland, Calif.) American jazz pianist, bandleader, and composer whose unique playing style made him one of the most influential musicians in jazz history.
Hines was born into a musical family in Pittsburgh. As a child he learned trumpet from his father and then piano from his mother; his sister was also a pianist who led bands in the 1930s. After playing in trios during his high school years, Hines played in various bands throughout the Midwest. In 1925–26 he toured with Carroll Dickerson’s orchestra. When Louis Armstrong took over Dickerson’s band in 1927, Hines stayed on as pianist and musical director. He participated in several groundbreaking recording sessions at about this time, including several as a member of Armstrong’s seminal quintet, the Hot Five, and others with clarinetist Jimmie Noone.
