Tlaloc, (
        Nahuatl: “He Who Makes Things Sprout”) Aztec rain god. Representations of a rain god wearing a peculiar mask, with large round eyes and long fangs, date at least to the Teotihuacán culture of the highlands (3rd to 8th century ad). His characteristic features were strikingly similar to those of the Maya rain god Chac of the same period.
During Aztec times (14th to 16th century), Tlaloc’s cult was apparently considered extremely important and had spread throughout Mexico. In the divinatory calendars, Tlaloc was the eighth ruler of the days and the ninth lord of the nights.
