Wild-water racing, also called white-water racing,  competitive canoe or kayak racing down swift-flowing, turbulent streams called wild water (often “white water” in the United States). The sport developed from the riding of rapids in small boats and rafts, a necessary skill for explorers, hunters, and fishermen. Later it became an increasingly popular form of recreation in parts of Europe and the United States.
International competition, which dates from 1950, has been dominated by Europeans. Contestants wear crash helmets and life jackets. They leave the starting point at intervals, and the person who covers a 2- to 5-mile (3- to 8-km) course in the least time is the winner. Although they compete in separate classes, the canoes and kayaks used are quite similar—decked over completely except for a hole for the rider, whose waist is wrapped with a plastic spray skirt to keep water out.
