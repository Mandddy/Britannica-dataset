The Lancet, British medical journal established in 1823. The journalâ€™s founder and first editor was Thomas Wakley, considered at the time to be a radical reformer. Wakley stated that the intent of the new journal was to report on the metropolitan hospital lectures and to describe the important cases of the day. The Lancet has since played an important role in medical and hospital reform movements in Britain and has become a highly prestigious medical journal around the world.
