Knot, in cording, the interlacement of parts of one or more ropes, cords, or other pliable materials, commonly used to bind objects together. Knots have existed from the time humans first used vines and cordlike fibres to bind stone heads to wood in primitive axes. Knots were also used in the making of nets and traps, but knot making became truly sophisticated only when it began to be used in the ropes, or rigging, that controlled the sails of early sailing vessels. Knot making thus became the province of sailors, who historically showed great skill and ingenuity in devising various kinds of knots for different purposes. With the coming of steam-powered engines to propel ships, the use of sails, rigging, and knots was much reduced, a trend that has continued even on modern sailboats because of the use of special cleats, winches, and other alternative devices to control the rigging. Knots are still widely used in daily life, though, and are depended on by campers and hikers, mountaineers, fishermen, and weavers, among others, or even by a person tying a shoelace or a package.
The principal requirements of a good knot are that it not slip when made and that it be tied and untied without difficulty. There are many different ways of fastening together one rope or cord to another or of attaching a rope to a spar, ring, or other object. In the narrow sense of the term, a knot is a knob made on a rope by turning the rope in on itself through a loop, as in an overhand knot. A hitch is used to attach a rope to some other object such as a spar, while a bend is used to fasten one rope to another rope. The governing principle of all knots, hitches, and bends is that the strain which pulls against them draws their constituent parts more tightly together, and the resulting friction allows the knot to “hold.” The “standing part” of a rope refers to that part which leads from the knot being tied toward the load. Some of the more important knots are described below.
