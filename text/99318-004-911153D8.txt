Hudson Maxim,  (born February 3, 1853, Orneville, Maine, U.S.—died May 6, 1927, Landing Post Office, New Jersey) American inventor of explosives extensively used in World War I.
Maxim’s study of chemistry at Wesleyan Seminary in Kent’s Hill, Maine, led to a hypothesis concerning the compound nature of atoms not unlike the atomic theory later accepted. In 1888, as a member of the gun and ammunition company founded by his brother, Hiram Maxim, he experimented with explosives and in 1890 built a dynamite and powder factory at Maxim, New Jersey. There, with R.C. Schupphaus, he developed the Maxim-Schupphaus smokeless powder, the first in the United States and the first adopted by the U.S. government. He next invented a smokeless cannon powder, with cylindrical grains so perforated that it burned more rapidly, which was widely used during World War I. In 1897 he sold his factory and patents to E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company but remained with them as consulting engineer until his death.
