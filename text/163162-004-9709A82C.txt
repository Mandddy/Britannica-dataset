Aleardo, Count Aleardi, original name Gaetano Aleardi   (born November 4, 1812, Verona, Austrian Empire—died July 17, 1878, Verona, Italy) poet, patriot, and political figure, an archetype of the 19th-century Italian poet-patriots. His love poems and passionate diatribes against the Austrian government brought him renown.
Brought up in Verona, then controlled by Austria, he studied law at the University of Padua. His love lyrics, Le lettere a Maria (1846; “The Letters to Maria”), were eagerly read; but back in Verona and prevented by the Austrian government from practicing law, he wrote a series of bitterly anti-Austrian poems, notably Le città italiane marinare e commercianti (1856; “The Maritime and Commercial Italian Cities”), I tre fiumi (1857; “The Three Rivers”), and I sette soldati (1861; “The Seven Soldiers”). He also edited, with the poet Giovanni Prati, an outspoken journal, Il Caffè Pedrocchi. The Austrians imprisoned him twice (1852 and 1859) and finally sent him into exile.
