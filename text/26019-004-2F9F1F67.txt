Guillaume-Thomas Raynal, abbé de Raynal,  (born April 12, 1713, Lapanouse, France—died March 6, 1796, Chaillot) French writer and propagandist who helped set the intellectual climate for the French Revolution.
Raynal was educated by the Jesuits and joined the order as a young man, but, after going to Paris to work for the church, he gave up religious life in favour of writing. He established himself as a writer with two historical works, one on the Netherlands (1747) and the other on the English Parliament (1748), both of them hackwork but popular and widely read. From 1750 to 1754 he edited the government-supported literary periodical Mercure de France, winning literary respectability and a place in society.
