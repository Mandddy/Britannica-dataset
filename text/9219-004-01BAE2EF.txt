Erich von Stroheim, original name Erich Oswald Stroheim  (born September 22, 1885, Vienna, Austria—died May 12, 1957, near Paris, France) one of the most critically respected motion-picture directors of the 20th century, best known for the uncompromising realism and accuracy of detail in his films. He also wrote screenplays and won recognition as an actor, notably for roles as sadistic, monocled Prussian officers.
Various sources provide contradictory information about Stroheim’s early life, probably because Stroheim himself was fond of embellishing his past. He was not, as reported in several accounts, descended from Viennese nobility, nor had he been an officer in the Austrian army. Rather, he was the son of a Jewish hatmaker, and he served in the army—though he was never an officer—before coming to the United States in 1909. He worked as an actor and as assistant to the leading director D.W. Griffith in such famous early films as The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916). Stroheim wrote the script and played the leading role in Blind Husbands (1919), his first independently directed picture. As an early exemplar of the changing postwar morality, it intimated that a woman had the right to seek love outside of an unsatisfying marriage. Stroheim’s growing obsession with painstaking detail was reflected in The Devil’s Passkey (1920; now lost) and Foolish Wives (1922), pictures that enhanced his reputation as a director.
