River Yare, stream in the county of Norfolk, England, which enters the North Sea 25 miles (40 km) east of Norwich. It flows sluggishly across Norfolk to Norwich, where it is joined by the Wensum from the north. In its lower course it traverses the flat alluvial tract of the Broads to its estuary, Breydon Water. The Rivers Bure (from the north) and Waveney (from the south) also enter this estuary, the mouth of which is deflected south for 3 miles (4.8 km) by the spit on which the resort of Great Yarmouth stands.
