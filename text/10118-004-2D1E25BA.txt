Mamba (genus Dendroaspis), any of four species of large, arboreal, venomous snakes that live throughout sub-Saharan Africa in tropical rainforests and savannas. Mambas are slender, agile, and quick and are active during the day. They have smooth scales, flat-sided (coffin-shaped) heads, long front fangs, and a powerful neurotoxic venom (see snakebite).
The “black,” or black-mouthed, mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis), averaging 2–2.5 metres (6.6–8.2 feet) in length (maximum 3.5 metres), ranges in colour from gray to dark brown but is never actually black. Its name derives from the inside of the mouth, which is black, in contrast to the white mouths of green mambas and other snakes. The black mamba inhabits rocky savanna and can often be encountered on the ground, where it seems to be fond of termite mounds. It lays 6 to 20 eggs in termite mounds or tree hollows. Prey consists primarily of small mammals and birds.
