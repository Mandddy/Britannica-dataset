Mozzarella, mild, smooth-textured cheese made in its authentic Italian version from the milk of the water buffalo; imitations of varying quality are commonly made of cowâ€™s milk.
Mozzarella is a plastic or stretched-curd cheese; the curd is mixed with heated whey and stretched and kneaded until it attains a smooth, pliable consistency. It is then molded into spheres or ovals and stored in water to keep it moist. Mozzarella is made fresh daily in many parts of Italy and in Italian delicatessens in the United States and elsewhere.
