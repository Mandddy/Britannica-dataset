Yellowstone River, river, noted for its scenic beauty, in the western United States. It flows through northwestern Wyoming, southern and eastern Montana, and northwestern North Dakota over a course of 692 miles (1,114 km). The river system drains about 70,000 square miles (181,300 square km).
The river rises on the slopes of Yount Peak in Wyoming’s Absaroka Range and soon enters the southeastern corner of Yellowstone National Park. It then flows northward into Yellowstone Lake, and, after exiting the north end of the lake, plunges 422 feet (129 metres) in two spectacular waterfalls and enters the magnificent Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The river then winds north and northwest before leaving the park at Gardiner, Montana. At Miner it turns northeastward and then northward on its way to Livingston. There it bends eastward to near Billings, where, flowing onto the high plains, it bends more northeastward past Miles City and Glendive. Just northeast of Sidney, it crosses from Montana into North Dakota and, southwest of Williston, enters the Missouri River. All its principal tributaries—the Bighorn, Tongue, and Powder rivers—originate in the Absaroka and Wind River ranges and the Bighorn Mountains.
