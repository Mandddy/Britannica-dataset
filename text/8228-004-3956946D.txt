Ankhesenamen, original name Ankhesenpaaton   (flourished  2nd millennium bce) queen of ancient Egypt (reigned 1332–22 bce), who shared the throne with the young king Tutankhamen.
Ankhesenamen was the third daughter of Akhenaton and Nefertiti, the couple who introduced the religious and cultural innovations of the Amarna period. She was probably married to her father toward the end of his reign, and the marriage seems to have produced one daughter, Ankhesenpaaton-tasherit (“Ankhesenpaaton the Younger”).
