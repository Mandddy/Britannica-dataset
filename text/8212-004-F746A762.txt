Dowitcher,  any of three species of shorebirds belonging to the genus Limnodromus, family Scolopacidae. The dowitcher has a chunky appearance and a long bill like a snipe and, in breeding plumage, has reddish underparts, giving rise to the alternative names red-breasted snipe and robin snipe (given also to the knot). It has a white rump and lower back.
Dowitchers flock on mudflats or sandbars; they fly in tight formations and, after landing, pause awhile before spreading out to feed. They nest in bogs from northeastern Siberia to Hudsonâ€™s Bay and winter on coasts from the southern U.S. to northern South America. The long-billed dowitcher (L. scolopaceus), about 30 centimetres (12 inches) long including the bill, has a more northwesterly breeding range than the short-billed dowitcher (L. griseus), which is about the same size except for the bill. There is also an Asian species, called the Asiatic dowitcher (L. semipalmatus).
