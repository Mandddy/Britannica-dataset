Salt Lake City, state capital and seat (1849) of Salt Lake county, north-central Utah, U.S., on the Jordan River at the southeastern end of Great Salt Lake. The world capital of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), it influences the social, economic, political, and cultural life of the people in a wide area of Utah and bordering regions of Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming. Built on benches of ancient Lake Bonneville, the city (approximate elevation 4,300 feet [1,300 metres]) lies at the foot of the Wasatch Range, which rises more than 1 mile (1.6 km) above the Salt Lake valley floor. Salt Lake City is at the centre of an urbanized band along the mountains that includes Ogden to the north and Provo to the south. Inc. 1851. Area city, 111 square miles (287 square km). Pop.

Ute and Shoshone Indians were early inhabitants of the area. The city was founded in 1847 by Brigham Young and a band of 148 Mormons as a refuge from religious persecution and was known as Great Salt Lake City until 1868. Laid out by Young according to Joseph Smith’s plan for the city of Zion, the city was divided into 10-acre (4-hectare) blocks bounded by wide streets grouped around the Temple Block (now known as Temple Square). Mormon immigrants from the East and Europe flocked to the “New Jerusalem,” the “City of the Saints,” in the Provisional State of Deseret (a Book of Mormon word interpreted as “honeybee”). The California Gold Rush of 1849 contributed to the city’s growth.
