Electrocution, method of execution in which the condemned person is subjected to a heavy charge of electric current.
Once the most widely used method of execution in the United States, electrocution was largely supplanted by lethal injection in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and is now used relatively rarely. The method applies one or more high voltage electrical currents through electrodes attached to the head and legs of a condemned inmate, who sits strapped to a chair. A typical electrocution lasts about two minutes.
