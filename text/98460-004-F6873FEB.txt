Judgment, also spelled judgement ,  in all legal systems, a decision of a court adjudicating the rights of the parties to a legal action before it. A final judgment is usually a prerequisite of review of a court’s decision by an appellate court, thus preventing piecemeal and fragmentary appeals on interlocutory (provisional) rulings (see interlocutory decree).
A judgment generally operates to settle finally and authoritatively matters in dispute before a court. Judgments may be classified as in personam, in rem, or quasi in rem. An in personam, or personal, judgment, the type most commonly rendered by courts, imposes a personal liability or obligation upon a person or group to some other person or group. This obligation may be to pay a sum of money, to perform some act, or to refrain from doing so. On the other hand, the judgment may be for the defendant, negating the plaintiff’s claim for relief.
