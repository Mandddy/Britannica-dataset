Butte, (
        French: hillock or rising ground)  also spelled bute,  flat-topped hill surrounded by a steep escarpment from the bottom of which a slope descends to the plain. The term is sometimes used for an elevation higher than a hill but not high enough for a mountain. Buttes capped by horizontal platforms of hard rock are characteristic of the arid plateau region of the western United States. See also mesa.
