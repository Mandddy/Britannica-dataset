Collie, working dog breed developed in Great Britain, probably by the 18th century. There are two varieties of collie: the rough-coated, originally used to guard and herd sheep, and the smooth-coated, used mainly to drive livestock to market. Collies are lithe dogs with tapering heads, almond-shaped eyes, and erect ears that tip forward at the ends. Both varieties are identical in form, although some authorities believe they were once distinct breeds. The rough-coated collie, a popular companion and watchdog, has a thick, straight coat that forms a heavy ruff about its neck and throat; the smooth-coated collie has a dense, smooth coat. Both varieties stand 22 to 26 inches (56 to 66 cm) and weigh 50 to 75 pounds (23 to 34 kg), and both are famed for their loyalty. They are brown and white, black with tan and white, blue-gray with black mottling and white markings, or white, usually with darker markings.
