Foxhound, either of two breeds of dogs, one English and one American, that are traditionally kept in packs for the centuries-old ride to hounds of fox-hunting sportsmen. The English foxhound is the product of long, careful breeding. It stands 21 to 25 inches (53 to 63.5 cm) and weighs 60 to 70 pounds (27 to 32 kg). It has a short coat, which is usually a combination of black, tan, and white.
The American foxhound resembles the English in appearance and size but is more lightly built. It is the oldest breed of sporting dog in the United States and was developed from English foxhounds imported in 1650 and in later years. Various regional strains are found in the United States and are named after their developers; these include the Trigg, Walker, July, and Birdsong hounds. Both breeds of foxhounds have been bred to be strong, swift, and versatile dogs; they are seldom kept as house pets.
