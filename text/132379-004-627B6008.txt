Rhône wine, any of numerous table wines, mostly red, from the Côtes du Rhône region of southeastern France. The vineyards are situated on either side of the Rhône River from south of Lyon to Avignon.
Wines designated by the broadest regional appellation, Côtes du Rhône, are agreeable but fairly undistinguished reds. The better wines are bottled under more specific district or village names, such as the red Châteauneuf-du-pape and the rosé Tavel, both from the southern Rhône. Wines of the northern Rhône are as a group the more distinguished, notable vineyards being Hermitage, Côte-rôtie, Cornas, and Saint-Joseph. The best white Rhônes, Condrieu and Château Grillet, are also made in the northern section. A highly esteemed sweet white, Beaumes-de-Venise, is made in the south.
