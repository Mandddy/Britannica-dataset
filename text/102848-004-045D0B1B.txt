M, German thriller film, released in 1931, that was noted for its use of groundbreaking lighting techniques and offscreen sound to maximize a sense of horror. M was German director Fritz Lang’s first sound film, and it featured Peter Lorre in his first major screen role.
Lorre played Hans Beckert, a psychologically tortured child murderer and presumed pedophile who terrorizes Berlin. When the authorities fail to catch him, the city’s criminal underworld joins forces with street beggars to do the job themselves, sparking a race between the two groups to find the murderer first and subject him to their own form of justice. The film’s title refers to the “M,” for murderer, that is chalked onto Beckert’s jacket, leading to his apprehension.
