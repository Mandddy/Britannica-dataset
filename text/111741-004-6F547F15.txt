Keith Jarrett,  (born May 8, 1945, Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American jazz pianist, composer, and saxophonist considered to be one of the most original and prolific jazz musicians to emerge during the late 20th century. He was also a noted classical pianist.
A child prodigy, Jarrett began studying the piano at age three and performed his first solo recital at seven. He worked as a professional musician while in elementary school, also learning to play drums, vibraphone, and soprano saxophone. He toured as piano soloist with Fred Waring’s Pennsylvanians while in his teens and played with Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers beginning in 1965. He joined saxophonist Charles Lloyd’s quartet in 1966 and stayed with Lloyd for three years. Jarrett made his first solo albums about this time, including such well-regarded efforts as Life Between the Exit Signs (1967) and Restoration Ruin (1968), on which he sang and played several instruments.
