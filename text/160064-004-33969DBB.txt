Larry King, original name Lawrence Harvey Zeiger  (born November 19, 1933, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American talk-show host whose easygoing interviewing style helped make Larry King Live (1985–2010) one of CNN’s longest-running and most popular programs.
King grew up in Brooklyn, where he remained for several years after high school graduation to help support his mother, who had been widowed when he was a young child. In his early twenties King left New York for Florida in the hopes of breaking into radio. He worked as a disc jockey in South Florida, honing his conversational interview style doing on-location interviews with random citizens. In 1960 he broke into television with a Miami-based talk show. King also wrote for a number of Miami newspapers during that period.
