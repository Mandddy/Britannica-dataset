Centipede (class Chilopoda), any of various long, flattened, many-segmented predaceous arthropods. Each segment except the hindmost bears one pair of legs.
Centipedes generally remain under stones, bark, and ground litter by day. At night they hunt for and capture other small invertebrates. They move rapidly on from 14 to 177 pairs of legs and have one pair of long, many-jointed antennae and a pair of jawlike, venomous claws just behind the head.
