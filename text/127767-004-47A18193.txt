Bunya pine, also called Bunya Bunya Pine,   (species Araucaria bidwillii), large evergreen conifer of the family Araucariaceae, native to Australia but used in the sapling stage as a houseplant in many areas. The tree is native to humid areas in southeastern Queensland. It grows to heights of 30 m (100 feet) or more and is notable for the symmetrical structure of its branches and its immense dome-shaped leafy crown. The tree’s large, sweet seeds were roasted and eaten by the Aborigines. The bunya pine’s thick, resinous bark covers a cream-coloured wood that is used for veneers, plywood, and boxes.
