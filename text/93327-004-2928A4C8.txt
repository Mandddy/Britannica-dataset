Manuel Tolsá,  (born 1757, Enguera, Spain—died December 1816, Mexico City, Viceroyalty of New Spain [now in Mexico]) Spanish-born sculptor and architect who introduced Neoclassicism to New Spain (Mexico).
Tolsá studied Neoclassical sculpture at the Academia de San Carlos in Valencia, Spain. He gained acclaim early in his career and in 1790 was named director of sculpture at the Academia de San Carlos in New Spain. He arrived there in July 1791 with an enormous library and a collection of plaster casts of ancient sculptures for his students to study. As director, he led students away from late Baroque aesthetics toward the Neoclassical style that was prevalent in Europe at the time.
