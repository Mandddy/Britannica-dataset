Danny Boyle,  (born October 20, 1956, Manchester, England) British director and screenwriter whose films were known for their bold visual imagery and exuberant energy.
Boyle began his career in the theatre, serving as the artistic director (1982–85) at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs and as deputy director (1985–87) at the Royal Court Theatre. In 1987 he made his directorial debut with the television movie Scout. He directed various other television projects before helming his first feature film, Shallow Grave (1994). The crime thriller—written by John Hodge, who became a frequent collaborator—was noted for its energetic visual style, which became a trademark of Boyle’s work. In 1996 the director scored his big breakthrough with Trainspotting. The darkly humorous look at heroin addicts, written by Hodge and featuring Shallow Grave star Ewan MacGregor, became an international hit and one of the United Kingdom’s highest-grossing films. MacGregor reteamed with Boyle on the romantic comedy A Life Less Ordinary (1997), but it failed to match the success of their previous efforts.
