Kolo, communal dance of some Balkan areas, the many variations of which are performed at weddings and other festive occasions. The name probably derives from the Old Slavic word for “wheel.” The dance may be performed in a closed circle, in a single chain, or in two parallel lines. In some versions, solo dancers display their skill inside the circle. Tempo varies, sometimes within a single dance, but the kolo is usually spirited and fast-moving. Closely related to the Romanian hora and the Bulgarian horo, the kolo is one of many European chain dances surviving from ancient times.
