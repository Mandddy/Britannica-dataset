Mass movement, also called Mass Wasting,  bulk movements of soil and rock debris down slopes in response to the pull of gravity, or the rapid or gradual sinking of the Earth’s ground surface in a predominantly vertical direction. Formerly, the term mass wasting referred to a variety of processes by which large masses of crustal materials are moved by gravity from one place to another. More recently, the term mass movement has been substituted to include mass wasting processes and the sinking of confined areas of the Earth’s ground surface. Mass movements on slopes and sinking mass movements are often aided by water and the significance of both types is the part each plays in the alteration of landforms.
The variety of downslope mass movements reflects the diversity of factors that are responsible for their origin. Such factors include: weathering or erosional debris cover on slopes, which is usually liable to mass movement; the character and structure of rocks, such as resistant permeable beds prone to sliding because of underlying impermeable rocks; the removal of the vegetation cover, which increases the slope’s susceptibility to mass movement by reducing its stability; artificial or natural increases in the slope’s steepness, which will usually induce mass movement; earthquake tremors, which affect the slope equilibrium and increase the likelihood of mass movement; and flowing ground water, which exerts pressure on soil particles and impairs slope stability. These factors affecting slope conditions will often combine with climatic factors such as precipitation and frost activity to produce downslope mass movement.
