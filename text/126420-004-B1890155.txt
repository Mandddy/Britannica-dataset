Codium,  genus of marine green algae usually found in deep pools along rocky coasts. Essentially filamentous, the multinucleate branches are often woven together to form a velvety pseudothallus. Its length can exceed 30 cm (11.8 inches). In sexual reproduction the male gametes are small, contain one or two chloroplasts, and have two flagella, while the female gametes are larger and have many chloroplasts. Codium is the favourite food of some sea slugs.
