Isabelle Huppert, in full Isabelle Anne Huppert  (born March 16, 1955, Paris, France) French actress who was acclaimed for her versatility and for the subtle gestures and restrained emotions of her portrayals.
Huppert developed an interest in acting as a teenager and entered the Versailles Conservatory in 1968. Three years later, at age 16, she made her film debut in Faustine et le bel été (1971; Faustine and the Beautiful Summer). Though cast in a bit part, she attracted notice and began working steadily; by the mid-1970s she had made more than 15 films. It was not until 1977, however, that she received international acclaim. In La Dentellière (The Lacemaker) her portrayal of Pomme, a young woman who suffers a nervous breakdown after being abandoned by her lover, earned Huppert the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Award as most promising newcomer. The following year she was named best actress at the Cannes film festival for her performance in Violette Nozière (1978) as a teenager who casually murders her father; it was the first of seven films she made with director Claude Chabrol. In 1980 Huppert appeared in her first English-language film, Heaven’s Gate, a Western that was panned by critics and ignored by audiences.
