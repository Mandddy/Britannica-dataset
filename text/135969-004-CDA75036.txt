R. Kelly, in full Robert Sylvester Kelly  (born January 8, 1967, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) American singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist who became one of the best-selling rhythm-and-blues (R&amp;B) artists of the 1990s and early 21st century. Kelly is known for his gospel-tinged vocal delivery and highly sexualized lyrics.
Kelly was raised in public-housing projects in Chicago, and he was taught a powerful sense of Christian faith by his mother. His singing style has been described as “church-trained,” and, though faith has been a recurring theme in his lyrics, such early singles as “Sex Me” (1993) established carnality at the centre of his music. The tension between the sacred and the profane, along with the contrast of tough-guy persona and tender vocals, have been constants in his career. On Kelly’s debut album, Born into the ’90s (1992), he joined with the vocal group Public Announcement to deliver a smooth and melodic signature sound laced with hip-hop rhythms. Subsequent efforts achieved ever-greater success as Kelly’s dominance of the R&amp;B market translated into pop stardom. His inspirational ballad “I Believe I Can Fly” (1996) was a massive hit and earned three Grammy Awards, including one for best R&amp;B song.
