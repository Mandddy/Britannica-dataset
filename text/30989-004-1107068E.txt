Giorgio Bassani,  (born March 4, 1916, Bologna, Italy—died April 13, 2000, Rome) Italian author and editor noted for his novels and stories examining individual lives played out against the background of modern history. The author’s Jewish heritage and the life of the Jewish community in Ferrara, Italy, are among his recurrent themes.
Bassani grew up in Ferrara. In 1938 he was studying literature in Bologna when racial laws were passed in Italy that restricted the activities of Jews, including banning them from universities. Bassani, who had to publish his early works under a pseudonym (Giacomo Marchi), became involved in the antifascist movement in the early 1940s and was briefly arrested in 1943. After World War II he settled in Rome, where he continued his writing career, while still maintaining a home in Ferrara. In addition to writing novels, poetry, screenplays, and essays, he also edited several literary journals, including Bottega Oscura.
