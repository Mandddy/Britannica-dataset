Fish processing, preparation of seafood and freshwater fish for human consumption.
The word fish is commonly used to describe all forms of edible finfish, mollusks (e.g., clams and oysters), and crustaceans (e.g., crabs and lobsters) that inhabit an aquatic environment. Fish from the marine and freshwater bodies of the world have been a major source of food for humankind since before recorded history. Harvesting wild fish from fresh and marine waters and raising cultured fish in ponds were practices of ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and other Mediterranean peoples. Rudimentary processing techniques such as sun-drying, salting, and smoking were used by these ancient groups to stabilize the fish supply. Modern methods of processing and preservation have encouraged the consumption of many species of fish that are popular throughout the world.
