Roller coaster, elevated railway with steep inclines and descents that carries a train of passengers through sharp curves and sudden changes of speed and direction for a brief thrill ride. Found mostly in amusement parks as a continuous loop, it is a popular leisure activity.
On a traditional roller coaster, gravity powers much of the trip. The potential energy for the entire ride is usually introduced in a large initial climb that is converted to kinetic energy on the first—and often sharpest—drop. Entertainment value is provided by the velocity of the descent as well as by the inverted loops, barrel rolls, and banked turns that create positive gravitational forces, or g-forces, that press down upon the rider in the seat. The so-called negative g-forces create the rider’s sense of weightlessness when lifted from the seat over the peaks of hills. On most roller coasters, riders remain seated beneath a safety bar, but variations include riders’ standing on a platform or hanging from a shoulder harness.
