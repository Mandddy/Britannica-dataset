Quilting, sewing technique in which two layers of fabric, usually with an insulating interior layer, are sewn together with multiple rows of stitching. It has long been used for clothing in China, the Middle East, North Africa, and the colder areas of Europe but is now primarily associated with the construction of bedcovers and wall hangings.
Making a bed quilt is a multistep process that first involves creating a quilt top, usually assembled of blocks made by cutting patches then stitching them together or by appliquéing cut-out shapes onto a backing. See appliqué; patchwork. Batting, or wadding, made of cotton, polyester, wool, or flannel is layered sandwich-style between the quilt top and backing. The three layers are basted or pinned together, and the quilting design is marked on the top and quilted (sewn) in small, even stitches by hand, sewing machine, or commercial quilting machine. Quilting designs may be geometric or figural, and the quality of the quilt depends in large part on the fineness of the stitching and the matching of appropriate designs to the piecing. A quilt’s layers may instead be stabilized by being tied at intervals with thread, yarn, or narrow ribbon. The outer raw edges of the quilt are usually turned together or covered with a binding.
