Dusty Springfield, original name Mary Isabel Catherine Bernadette O’Brien  (born April 16, 1939, London, England—died March 2, 1999, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire) British vocalist who made her mark as a female hit maker and icon during the 1960s beat boom that resulted in the British Invasion.
Mary O’Brien, the daughter of a tax consultant, grew up in prosperous Hampstead in North London. In 1958 she became the third member of a short-lived girl group known as the Lana Sisters. Reinventing herself as Dusty Springfield, she then joined her brother Dion (stage name Tom Springfield) in the British country-music trio the Springfields, who achieved moderate success in the early 1960s.
