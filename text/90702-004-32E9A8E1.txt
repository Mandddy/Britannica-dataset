The Time Machine, American science-fiction film, released in 1960, that was based on H.G. Wellsâ€™s classic story that explores both the theoretical possibilities and the perils of time travel.
A Victorian-era scientist (played by Rod Taylor) invents a machine that transports him through time. He travels forward to flee the warlike world of 1900. He stops the machine in 1917, in 1940, and in 1966, but he finds the world at war on all three occasions. He eventually travels to the year 802,701 and discovers a race of benign humans, the Eloi, menaced by hordes of ferocious man-beasts, the Morlocks, who prey on the Eloi at will.
