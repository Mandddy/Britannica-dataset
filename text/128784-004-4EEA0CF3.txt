Dalton minimum, also called Modern minimum,  period of reduced sunspot activity that occurred between roughly 1790 and 1830. It was named for the English meteorologist and chemist John Dalton.
Sunspot activity waxes and wanes with over about an 11-year cycle. During the Dalton minimum, the solar cycle continued; however, the number of sunspots at the peak of the solar cycles was about one-third of that observed during normal solar cycles. The three solar cycles that occurred during the Dalton minimum also had unusually long periods of sunspot inactivity.
