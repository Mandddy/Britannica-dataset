Victoria, city, capital of British Columbia, Canada, located on the southern tip of Vancouver Island between the Juan de Fuca and Haro straits, approximately 60 miles (100 km) south-southwest of the province’s largest city, Vancouver. Victoria is the largest urban area on the island. It has the mildest winter climate of any city in Canada, and its many parks and green spaces have inspired its description as a “garden city.” Above all, Victoria is a city whose British heritage and colonial past can be seen clearly in its architecture, gardens, museums, urban squares, place-names, and English-style pubs. Area: city, 8 square miles (20 square km); metro. area, 269 square miles (696 square km). Pop. (2006) city, 78,057; metro. area, 330,088; (2011) city, 80,017; metro. area, 344,615.
The history of settlement by Coast Salish (Salishan) First Nations (Native American) people in the Victoria region dates back well over 10,000 years. The site of the future city was known to the Coast Salish as Camosun or Camosack. In 1778 explorer Capt. James Cook reached the island. English navigator George Vancouver was with Cook on that voyage and returned in 1792 to circumnavigate and survey the island, which was later named for him. As fur trading became established in the region, the Hudson’s Bay Company came to dominate the island and in 1843 established Fort Camosun—later called Fort Albert and then Fort Victoria, for the British queen—at the city’s present site.
