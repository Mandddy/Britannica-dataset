Shaun White, in full Shaun Roger White, byname the Flying Tomato  (born September 3, 1986, San Diego, California, U.S.) American snowboarder who won Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe event in 2006 and 2010.
White survived a heart defect that required two operations when he was an infant. Despite his early health problems, he was soon skateboarding, surfing, skiing, and playing association football (soccer). He took up snowboarding at age six and the following year won his first competition. He became a phenomenon on the amateur circuit, claiming five national titles, and turned professional at age 13. He made his Winter X Games debut in 2000 and won five slopestyle titles (2003–06, 2009), as well as superpipe titles in 2003, 2006, and 2008–13. At age 15 White fell 0.3 point short of qualifying for the U.S. team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Undeterred, he dominated the professional circuit for the next two years, and when qualifying began for the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics, he won the halfpipe in all five of the Grand Prix events that determined team selection.
