Opah (genus Lampris), also called moonfish,  any of two species of large marine fish of the family Lampridae (order Lampridiformes). One species, Lampris guttatus, is the only known fully warm-blooded fish.
A deep-bodied fish with a small toothless mouth, the opah (L. guttatus) grows to a length of about 2 metres (7 feet) and a weight of 140 kg (300 pounds), although larger specimens have been reported. The southern opah (L. immaculatus) is smaller, averaging about 110 cm (43 inches) and 30 kg (66 pounds). Both species are distinctively coloured, blue above and rosy below, with scarlet fins and jaws and round white spots on the body. The opah occurs in the tropical and temperate oceans of both hemispheres, whereas the southern opah is limited to the temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere. Although uncommon, opahs are valued as food.
