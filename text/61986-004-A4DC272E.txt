Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman, née Mary Eleanor Wilkins  (born Oct. 31, 1852, Randolph, Mass., U.S.—died  March 13, 1930, Metuchen, N.J.) American writer known for her stories and novels of frustrated lives in New England villages.
Mary Wilkins moved with her family to Brattleboro, Vermont, in 1867. She lived at home after studying for a year in 1870–71 at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (now Mount Holyoke College), read widely on her own, and began writing children’s stories and verse. In 1883, by which time both her parents had died, she returned to her birthplace of Randolph, Massachusetts, to live with friends, and in that year she published in a Boston newspaper her first story for adults. She did her best work while living in Randolph in the 1880s and ’90s. In 1902 Wilkins married Charles M. Freeman of Metuchen, New Jersey, where she lived until her death.
