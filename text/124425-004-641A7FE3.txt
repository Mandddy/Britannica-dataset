Narasimha, (
        Sanskrit: “Man-Lion”) one of the 10 avatars (incarnations) of the Hindu god Vishnu. The demon Hiranyakashipu—twin brother of Hiranyaksha, the demon overthrown by Vishnu in his previous incarnation as Varaha—obtained a boon from the god Brahma that he could not be killed by human or animal, from inside or outside, by day or by night, and that no weapon could harm him. Thus, feeling secure, he began to trouble heaven and earth. His son, Prahlada, on the other hand, was a devotee of Vishnu, even though his father threatened his life because of it. One day the demon challenged Prahlada and, kicking a stone pillar, asked: “If your god is omnipresent, is he in this pillar also?” Vishnu emerged from the pillar in the form of a man-lion and slew the demon at dusk on the threshold.
The incident is often depicted in art, with Narasimha appearing out of the pillar or engaged in ripping open the belly of the demon, one of his numerous pairs of hands holding up the entrails like a garland. The animal aspect is shown by a curly mane of hair, sharp, curved teeth, and leonine facial features. The body, though human, has a thick neck, large shoulders, and slender abdomen and waist. Seated images of Narasimha are also found in which the lion face has a pacific expression.
