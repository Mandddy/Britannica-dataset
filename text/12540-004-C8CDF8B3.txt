César Cui, in full César Antonovich Cui  (born Jan. 6 [Jan. 18, New Style], 1835, Vilna [now Vilnius], Lithuania, Russian Empire—died March 24, 1918, Petrograd [St. Petersburg], Russia) Russian composer of operas, songs, and piano music. He was a music critic and military engineer who, with Aleksandr Borodin, Mily Balakirev, Modest Mussorgsky, and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, made up the group known as The Five.
Cui was the son of a French officer, taken prisoner during Napoleon’s campaign of 1812, who remained in Russia after the war; his mother was Lithuanian. Cui began to compose while he was still a boy, imitating the style of Frédéric Chopin, and received lessons in composition. But in 1851 he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he entered the school of engineering and, in 1855, the academy of military engineering, becoming a lecturer there in 1857. In 1878 he became a professor of fortification—his pupils included General M.D. Skobelev, a hero of the Russo-Turkish war, and Tsar Nicholas II—and he retired with the rank of lieutenant general.
