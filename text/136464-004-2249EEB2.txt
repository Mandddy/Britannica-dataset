Muong,  ethnic minority in Vietnam, located in the mountainous area southwest of Hanoi. Considered the only surviving descendants of the early Vietnamese, the Muong, unlike the lowland northern Vietnamese, have been little influenced by the Chinese. They staged unsuccessful rebellions against the French-ruled Vietnamese in 1822, 1833, and in the 1880s. Their language, called Muong, is a subset of the Vietic branch of Mon-Khmer, a language family of Austroasiatic stock. They numbered about 1,100,000 in the late 20th century.
The Muong social structure is patrilineal and has as its foundation the extended family; only males own property. Originally, the Muong had an organized feudal system of landed nobility (including a headman for territorial units) and a peasant class. Although the upper classes still have some privileges over the peasant class, today private ownership of land has gradually replaced ownership by the nobility.
