Spearmint (Mentha spicata), aromatic herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae), widely used for culinary purposes. Spearmint is native to Europe and Asia and has been naturalized in North America and parts of Africa. The leaves are used fresh or dried to flavour many foods, particularly sweets, beverages, salads, soups, cheeses, meats, fish, sauces, fruits, and vegetables. The essential oil is used to flavour toothpaste, candles, candies, and jellies; its principal component is carvone.
Spearmint is a perennial plant that aggressively spreads by creeping stolons. The simple fragrant leaves are sharply serrated and arranged oppositely along the square stems. Spearmint has lax, tapering spikes of lilac, pink, or white flowers.
