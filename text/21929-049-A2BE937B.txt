Po River, Latin Padus,  longest river in Italy, rising in the Monte Viso group of the Cottian Alps on Italy’s western frontier and emptying into the Adriatic Sea in the east after a course of 405 miles (652 km). Its drainage basin covers 27,062 square miles (70,091 square km), forming Italy’s widest and most fertile plain.
Flowing eastward in its upper course, the Po is rapid and precipitous, descending about 5,500 feet (1,700 m) in its first 22 miles (35 km). Just west of Saluzzo the Po turns sharply northward, flows through Turin and skirts the Monferrato upland, then turns east at Chivasso and continues in a generally easterly course to its delta on the Adriatic.
