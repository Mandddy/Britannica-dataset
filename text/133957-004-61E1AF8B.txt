Fruit processing, preparation of fruit for human consumption.
Fruit is sometimes defined as the product of growth from an angiosperm, or flowering plant. From a purely botanical point of view, the fruit may be only the fleshy growth that arises from the ovary of a flower and may not necessarily include any other structures. From the consumer’s or food processor’s point of view, however, fruit is generally characterized as the edible product of a plant or tree that includes the seed and its envelope and can typically be described as juicy, sweet, and pulpy. Typical fruit structures are illustrated in Figure 1.
