Nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), slender antelope of southeastern Africa, a member of the spiral-horned antelope tribe Tragelaphini (family Bovidae), which also includes the kudu and eland. The nyala is notable for its extreme gender differences (sexual dimorphism) and specialized habitat preferences that limit its distribution to the Lowveld of southern Africa.
Females and young sport short, bright chestnut coats with 8–13 white stripes on the torso, spots and bands on the legs, chest, and cheeks, and a bushy tail with a white underside. Females weigh about 58 kg (128 pounds) and have a shoulder height of 92 cm (36 inches). Males are much larger, standing 106 cm (42 inches) tall and weighing 98–125 kg (216–275 pounds), and carry horns 60–83 cm (24–33 inches) long with 1.5–2.5 twists. They gradually turn dark charcoal gray and shaggy as they mature and have a long fringe from throat to hindquarters and an erectile spinal crest from head to tail. Their stripes and spots mostly disappear under the long hair, but the tan lower legs, ears, and forehead persist. Males resemble a dryland version of the male sitatunga, whereas females could pass for lesser kudus.
