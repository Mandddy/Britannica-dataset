Abbreviation, in communications (especially written), the process or result of representing a word or group of words by a shorter form of the word or phrase. Abbreviations take many forms and can be found in ancient Greek inscriptions, in medieval manuscripts (e.g., “DN” for “Dominus Noster”), and in the Qurʾān. Cicero’s secretary, Marcus Tullius Tiro, devised many abbreviations that have survived to modern times, such as the character ampersand, &amp;, for et (Latin: “and”). But it was the so-called information explosion of the 20th century that made abbreviation a common practice in communication.
A major factor in the trend toward abbreviation is that of economy. Scientific studies indicate that a significant amount of all information in relatively long communications is redundant, and this knowledge makes abbreviation not only possible but convenient. Another factor in the development of abbreviations is the proliferation of new products and organizations that need to be named. Long descriptive terms can be shortened into mnemonic units. This is especially noticeable in Internet communication, particularly with e-mails, where a huge number of abbreviated forms came into use beginning in the 1990s. The need for speed in shorthand and the desire to avoid redundancy in codes makes abbreviation an important element in stenography and cryptography as well.
