James Ford Rhodes,  (born May 1, 1848, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—died  Jan. 22, 1927, Brookline, Mass.) American businessman and historian, best known for his multivolume investigation of the antebellum, American Civil War, and Reconstruction periods of the United States’ history.
Although he was educated at both New York University (1865–66) and the University of Chicago (1866–67), Rhodes never earned a degree. In 1867 he left college and went to Europe, living in Paris for a time before studying metallurgy in Berlin.
