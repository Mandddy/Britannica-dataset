Shichi-fuku-jin,  (Japanese: “Seven Gods of Luck”), group of seven popular Japanese deities, all of whom are associated with good fortune and happiness. The seven are drawn from various sources but have been grouped together from at least the 16th century. They are Bishamon, Daikoku, Ebisu, Fukurokuju, Jurōjin, Hotei, and the only female in the group, Benten.
The Shichi-fuku-jin are a favourite theme of Japanese folk song and are frequently given comic representation in painting and theatre, both singly and as a group. The seven are often shown on their treasure ship (takara-bune) together with various magical implements, such as a hat of invisibility, rolls of brocade, an inexhaustible purse, keys to the divine treasure-house, cloves, scrolls or books, a lucky rain hat, or a robe of feathers.
