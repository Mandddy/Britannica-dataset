Vatican Museums and Galleries,  art collections of the popes since the beginning of the 15th century, housed in the papal palaces and other buildings in the Vatican. The Pio-Clementino Museum (Museo Pio-Clementino or Musei di Scultura) was founded in the 18th century by Pope Clement XIV and enlarged by Pope Pius VI. This museum exhibits the pontifical collection of ancient sculpture that originated with the collection of Pope Julius II. The Chiaramonti Sculpture Gallery (Museo Chiaramonti), established by Pope Pius VII in the 19th century and designed by the sculptor Antonio Canova, is also devoted to ancient sculpture. It has three parts: the museum, in a gallery designed by Bramante; the New Wing (Braccio Nuovo); and the Gallery of Inscriptions (Lapideria) with its unrivalled collection of ancient epigraphy. The Gregorian Etruscan Museum (Museo Gregoriano Etrusco), founded in 1836 by Pope Gregory XVI (reorganized in 1924), houses a collection of objects from Etruscan excavations and objects from the Regolini-Galassi tomb with its collection of Etruscan jewelry. The Egyptian Museum (Museo Gregoriano Egizio), also founded by Gregory XVI, was opened to the public in 1839. The Pinacoteca, founded by Pope Pius VI in 1797, has been housed in its present gallery (commissioned by Pope Pius XI) since 1932. It has an outstanding collection of Italian religious paintings and also includes Russian and Byzantine painting.
In 1956 a modern art collection was initiated, which exhibits secular works by such 19th- and 20th-century artists as Renoir, Seurat, Van Gogh, Rouault, Matisse, and Picasso. In 1973 the Vatican opened its first museum of contemporary art, including the work of both European and U.S. artists, housed in 65 galleries in the Vatican Palace.
