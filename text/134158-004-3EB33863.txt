Juliusz Słowacki,  (born September 4, 1809, Krzemieniec, Poland—died April 3, 1849, Paris, France) Polish poet and dramatic author, one of the most important poets of the Romantic period.
The son of a university professor, Słowacki was educated in Wilno (now Vilnius), Lithuania, until 1829, when he joined the Department of the Treasury in Warsaw. He was absorbed with reading and writing poetry. During the November Insurrection of 1830, he appears to have been made an envoy of the insurrectionary government. He resigned from the Treasury in 1831 and traveled to Dresden (Germany), Paris, and London, presumably carrying dispatches. In 1833–35 Słowacki was in Switzerland, and a year later he was in Italy, where he wrote his love idyll W Szwajcarii (1839; In Switzerland). His travels to the Middle East in 1837–38 are described in Podróż do ziemi świętej z Neapolu (published posthumously, 1866; “Voyage to the Holy Land from Naples”), a narrative poem. He spent most of his exile in Paris, which was the centre for the large number of émigrés who had fled from Poland following the 1830 uprising. His letters to his mother from Paris are classics of Polish prose.
