Little owl,  (Athene noctua), brownish bird about 20 centimetres (about 8 inches) long, belonging to the family Strigidae (order Strigiformes). Little owls occur in Europe, central Asia, and northern Africa and have been introduced into New Zealand. They are active during the day and often perch in the open. They usually nest in buildings or natural holes and eat insects and small mammals, birds, and reptiles. Two other species (A. brama and A. blewitti) are found in India and southeast Asia.
