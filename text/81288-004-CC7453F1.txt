Wombat (family Vombatidae), any of three large terrestrial species of Australian marsupials. Like woodchucks, wombats are heavily built and virtually tailless burrowers with small eyes and short ears. Wombats, however, are larger, measuring 80 to 120 cm (31 to 47 inches) long. Chiefly nocturnal and strictly herbivorous, they eat grasses and, in the case of the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), the inner bark of tree and shrub roots. Wombats are considered pests by farmers because they dig in cultivated fields and pastures and because their burrows may harbour rabbits.
The common wombat has coarse dark hair and a bald, granular nose pad. It is common in woodlands of hilly country along the Dividing Range in southeastern Australia, from southeastern Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria into South Australia, and in Tasmania. In historic times dwarf forms lived on small islands in the Bass Strait, but these have become extinct because of habitat destruction by grazing cattle.
