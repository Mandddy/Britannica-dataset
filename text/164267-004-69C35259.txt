Doc Watson, original name Arthel Lane Watson  (born March 3, 1923, Stony Fork, near Deep Gap, North Carolina, U.S.â€”died May 29, 2012, Winston-Salem, North Carolina) American musician and singer who introduced a flat-picking style that elevated the acoustic guitar from a rhythmically strummed background instrument to a leading role in bluegrass, country, folk, and rock music, notably during the folk music revival of the 1960s.
Watson was blind from infancy. He grew up on a farm, and with the encouragement of his father, he learned to play guitar, banjo, and harmonica, often picking out tunes that he heard on the radio or on old records. After a few years at a school for the blind, he quit and began playing and singing for tips on street corners and at amateur competitions, including some that were broadcast on local radio stations. In the early 1950s Watson joined Jack Williams and the Country Gentlemen, a country-and-western dance band that lacked a fiddler, so he taught himself to play the fast-paced lead-fiddle parts on his guitar. A decade later folklorist Ralph Rinzler recorded Watson with other local musicians and with his family, including Gaither Carlton, an old-time fiddler and banjo player whose daughter Watson had married in 1947.
