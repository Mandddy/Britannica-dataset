Lucius Appuleius Saturninus,  (died 100 bc) Roman politician who, with Gaius Servilius Glaucia, opposed the Roman Senate from 103 to 100, at first with the cooperation of the prominent general Gaius Marius.
Saturninus turned against the leaders of the Senate when, while serving as quaestor (financial administrator) at the port city of Ostia (probably in 105), he was stripped of his supervision of the grain supply by the leader of the Senate, Marcus Aemilius Scaurus. From 103 through 100 he used the office of tribune of the plebs (at the time, a position that reinforced popular sovereignty) to harass the Senate and build his own power. As tribune in 103, he successfully championed several measures against strong senatorial opposition: he sought the support of the Roman urban proletariat by a law that drastically reduced the price of the monthly grain ration; he won the backing of the popular general Gaius Marius by a bill that granted generous pieces of land to the men who had served under Marius in the Jugurthine War (111–105); and he set up the first standing criminal court to try charges of treason (maiestas) and used it against senators who opposed him. Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, as censor for 102, tried unsuccessfully to expel Saturninus and his colleague Gaius Servilius Glaucia from the Senate. The next year Saturninus was able to win acquittal on a capital charge because he had the backing of the equites (knights), whose support had been won by Glaucia’s bill restoring to them the exclusive right of constituting the juries in the permanent criminal courts.
