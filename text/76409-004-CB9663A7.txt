John Barrymore, original name John Blyth   (born February 15, 1882, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 29, 1942, Hollywood, California) American actor, called “The Great Profile,” who is remembered both for his roles as a debonair leading man and for his interpretations of Shakespeare’s Richard III and Hamlet. (See Barrymore reading from Henry VI, Part 3.)
John was born into a theatrical family; his parents, Maurice and Georgiana Barrymore, were stage actors, and his siblings, Ethel and Lionel, also became noted actors. John studied painting in Paris but returned to the United States to make his stage debut in 1903. He became a popular light comedian, but it was in serious roles that he scored his greatest stage triumphs. The most important of these were Justice (1916), Peter Ibbetson (1917), The Jest (1919), Richard III (1920), and Hamlet (New York, 1922; London, 1925).
