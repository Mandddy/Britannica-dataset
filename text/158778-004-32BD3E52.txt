Museum of Islamic Art, museum in Cairo, the largest in the world dedicated to Islamic art and artifacts.
The Egyptian khedive Tawfīq gave the decree that led to the establishment of the museum in 1881, authorizing a group of European and Egyptian art preservationists led by the Hungarian Orientalist Max Herz to gather detached fragments from historic structures in Cairo that had fallen into disrepair. These items, the beginnings of the modern museum’s collection, were housed in the mosque of the Fāṭimid caliph al-Ḥākim until 1903, when they were moved to a new museum building designed by Alfonso Manelesco in a neo-Mamlūk style. Since then the museum has acquired a substantial collection of artifacts from outside Egypt, representing most of the major periods of Islamic history and most regions of the Islamic world. The museum’s collection includes a number of notable artifacts, such as the oldest Islamic gold dinar ever found, dating to the 7th century ce; several rare Qurʾāns; a restored Mamlūk mosaic fountain; and an engraved ewer taken from a grave thought to be that of the last Umayyad caliph, Marwān II. Despite the museum’s remarkable collection of Islamic art, it is often overshadowed by the Egyptian Museum, which displays ancient Egyptian artifacts and attracts millions of visitors annually.
