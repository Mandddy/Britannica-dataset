Thomas Toft,  (flourished 1660–80) one of the most prominent of the English potters working in Staffordshire during the 17th century. The Staffordshire potters were known for the excellence of their slipware, a kind of coarse earthenware decorated with a coloured clay and water mixture of creamlike consistency called slip.
Toft was the first to add aluminous shale, or fireclay, a clay that can withstand high temperatures, to the paste for his earthenware. His work is characterized by restrained use of colour and unsophisticated, frequently amusing decoration. Toft ware bears designs in shades of red and brown, with small white dots adding liveliness. His themes include portraits of royalty, coats of arms, and emblems. His signature often appears on the wares. Toft’s large plates and oven dishes are considered outstanding works of art. He also produced porringers, bowls, jars, cups, and candlesticks.
