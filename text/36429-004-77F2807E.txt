Joseph de Maistre,  (born April 1, 1753, Chambéry, France—died February 26, 1821, Turin, kingdom of Sardinia [Italy]) French polemical author, moralist, and diplomat who, after being uprooted by the French Revolution in 1789, became a great exponent of the conservative tradition.
Maistre studied with the Jesuits and became a member of the Savoy Senate in 1787, following the civil career of his father, a former Senate president. After the invasion of Savoy by the armies of Napoleon in 1792, he began his lifelong exile in Switzerland, where he frequented the literary salon of Germaine de Staël in Coppet. Appointed envoy to St. Petersburg by the king of Sardinia in 1803, he remained at the Russian court for 14 years, writing Essay on the Generative Principle of Political Constitutions (1814) and his best work (unfinished), The St. Petersburg Dialogues (1821). On his recall he settled in Turin as chief magistrate and minister of state of the Sardinian kingdom.
