Tom Bradley, in full Thomas Bradley  (born December 29, 1917, Calvert, Texas, U.S.—died September 29, 1998, Los Angeles, California) American politician, the first African American mayor of a predominantly white city, who served an unprecedented five terms as mayor of Los Angeles (1973–93).
The son of sharecroppers and the grandson of slaves, Bradley grew up in poverty. When he was seven years old, his parents moved to Los Angeles. Excelling at track and football, Bradley entered the University of California, Los Angeles, on an athletic scholarship but left without a degree in 1940 to join the Los Angeles police department. While an officer, he took a law degree at Southwestern University in 1956. Over 21 years he rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant, the highest rank achieved to that time by an African American. He became active in the Democratic Party, and in 1963 he reached another milestone when he became the first African American member to be elected to the Los Angeles city council, representing a racially mixed district.
