Chervil (Anthriscus cerefolium), annual herb of the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae). It is native to regions of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea and to western Asia. Chervil is cultivated in Europe for its lacy, decompound, aromatic leaves, which are used to flavour fish, salads, soups, eggs, meat dishes, and stuffings for poultry and fish. Herb mixtures such as the French fines herbes frequently contain chervil. Chervil has a delicate aroma and a taste reminiscent of anise. The essential oil occurs in a duct accompanying each of the veins in the leaflets and rachis (the axis of the leaflets). In some parts of Europe, chervil root is eaten as a vegetable.
