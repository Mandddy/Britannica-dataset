Abrāj al-Bayt, also spelled Abrāj al-Bait, also called Makkah Royal Clock Tower,  multitowered skyscraper complex adjacent to the Great Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Completed in 2012, it is the world’s second tallest building, surpassed only by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The central clock tower (including its spire) rises to a height of 1,972 feet (601 metres). The Abrāj al-Bayt complex has approximately 16 million square feet (1.5 million square metres) of floor space, nearly equaling the area of Dubai International Airport’s Terminal 3—the largest building in the world by floor area. The complex houses hotels, shopping centres, residential apartments, and a prayer area capable of accommodating thousands of worshippers. Designed and constructed by the Saudi Binladin Group, along with a number of other Saudi and international firms, the entire project was reported to cost $3 billion.
The complex comprises seven towers—a 95-story central tower surrounded by six towers rising between 42 and 48 stories high. Much of the space is devoted to luxury hotels to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors to Mecca; approximately two million Muslim pilgrims come each year to perform the hajj, and the city also receives millions of business travelers and tourists yearly.
