Philip Seymour Hoffman,  (born July 23, 1967, Fairport, New York, U.S.—died February 2, 2014, New York City) American actor known for scene-stealing work in supporting roles and for his Academy Award-winning portrayal of Truman Capote in Capote (2005).
Hoffman became interested in theatre when he was in high school. Following studies at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts (B.F.A., 1989), he began working in the theatre in New York City and Chicago and on tour in Europe. His first notable movie role was in Scent of a Woman (1992). Subsequent films, including Twister (1996), gained him further audience recognition. His big breakthrough came with his painfully emotional performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights (1997), which was set in the world of adult entertainment. Hoffman went on to add a number of noteworthy credits, among them Anderson’s Magnolia (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), and Almost Famous (2000); in the latter film he played real-life music journalist Lester Bangs. He continued his collaboration with Anderson in Punch Drunk Love (2002) and drew praise for his work in Spike Lee’s 25th Hour.
