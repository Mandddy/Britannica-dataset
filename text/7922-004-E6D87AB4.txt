Miles Davis, in full Miles Dewey Davis III  (born May 26, 1926, Alton, Ill., U.S.—died  Sept. 28, 1991, Santa Monica, Calif.) American jazz musician, a great trumpeter who as a bandleader and composer was one of the major influences on the art from the late 1940s.
Davis grew up in East St. Louis, Ill., where his father was a prosperous dental surgeon. (In later years he often spoke of his comfortable upbringing, sometimes to rebuke critics who assumed that a background of poverty and suffering was common to all great jazz artists.) He began studying trumpet in his early teens; fortuitously, in light of his later stylistic development, his first teacher advised him to play without vibrato. Davis played with jazz bands in the St. Louis area before moving to New York City in 1944 to study at the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School)—although he skipped many classes and instead was schooled through jam sessions with masters such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Davis and Parker recorded together often during the years 1945–48.
