Zhang Yimou,  (born November 14, 1950/51, Xi’an, Shaanxi province, China) Chinese director who, as a prominent member of China’s “Fifth Generation,” is known for his works that explore sexual repression and political oppression.
Zhang’s father, a former major in Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist (Kuomintang) army, was blacklisted when communists took control of China in the late 1940s. During the Cultural Revolution the younger Zhang spent years in forced labour on a farm; he later worked in a factory. The Cultural Revolution ended in 1976, and two years later he entered the Beijing Film Academy. There Zhang studied with a group of aspiring filmmakers—notably Chen Kaige and Tian Zhuangzhuang—that became known as the Fifth Generation. Deeming modern Chinese movies unimaginative and of poor quality, they sought to make innovative films that often examined the country’s social issues and history.
