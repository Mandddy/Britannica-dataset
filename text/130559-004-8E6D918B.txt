Minas Gerais, large inland estado (state) of southeastern Brazil. It is the country’s storehouse of mineral riches, as indicated by its name, which in Portuguese means “General Mines.” The state is bounded to the north by the states of Goiás and Bahia; to the east by Bahia, Espírito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro; to the south by Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo; and to the west by São Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Goiás. It is Brazil’s fourth largest state and has the second largest population, exceeded only by that of São Paulo. Minas Gerais’s capital and largest city is Belo Horizonte, located in the south-central part of the state. Area 226,460 square miles (586,528 square km). Pop. (2010) 19,597,330.
Minas Gerais lies almost wholly within the geologically ancient, mineral-rich uplands known as the Brazilian Highlands, a much dissected hilly upland reaching an elevation of about 2,600 feet (790 metres) above sea level. Only small sections of the southern and eastern parts are within the zone of the Great Escarpment that forms the eastern margin of the highlands. In the southwest, along the border of São Paulo, is the commanding range known as the Mantiqueira Mountains, whose highest summit, Agulhas Negras Peak (also called Itatiaia Peak), reaches 9,144 feet (2,787 metres). The other principal range is the Espinhaço Mountains, which begin a little south of Belo Horizonte and extend northward into Bahia. It forms the divide between the rivers draining to the São Francisco River and those draining eastward directly to the Atlantic (the Doce, Mucuri, Jequitinhonha). In the southwest Minas Gerais is drained by the Rio Grande, one of the major headwaters of the Paraná River. The whole northwestern part of the state is drained by the São Francisco, which flows northward through a rift valley to the west of the Serra do Espinhaço.
