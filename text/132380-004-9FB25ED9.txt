Sherry, fortified wine of Spanish origin that typically has a distinctive nutty flavour. It takes its name from the province of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain, sherry being an Anglicization of Jerez. The substance is also produced elsewhere—notably in Cyprus, South Africa, Australia, and the United States, but Spanish producers have attempted to reserve the name sherry exclusively for the fortified wines of Spain.
Authentic sherry comes from the sherry region, which is officially demarcated and indicated on a bottle’s label by the words “Jerez DO” (Denominacion de Origen). Labels from the sherry region also contain the words Jerez-Xérès-Sherry. This region is centred on the southwestern coast, which encompasses the towns of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa María, as well as Jerez de la Frontera. A distinguished and venerable wine, sherry is a product of the region’s limestone-rich, chalky soil (albariza), its native grapes—particularly Palomino and Pedro Ximénez—and a unique vinification process. Essential is the action of flor, mildewlike yeasts encouraged by a slight exposure to air after fermentation, which imparts the characteristic nutty flavour.
