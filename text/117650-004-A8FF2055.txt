River Slaney, river, rising on Lugnaquillia Mountain (3,038 feet [926 m]), County Wicklow, Ireland. It turns westward in a steep torrential course to the Glen of Imail, a granite basin 500–700 feet (150–215 m) above sea level and runs south through the farmed lowlands of County Carlow to Bunclody, where it is joined by the Clody and continues southeast through the Slaney Gap. It receives two major tributaries, the Derry, above Bunclody, and the Bann, north of Enniscorthy, where the river becomes tidal. Quays were built there in the 19th century for barge traffic to Wexford. The Slaney finally enters Wexford Harbour, a sheltered inlet of more importance for shipping in the 19th century than at present. Its length is 73 miles (118 km).
