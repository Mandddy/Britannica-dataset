River Mersey, river in northern Tasmania, Australia, rising in the lake district near Mount Pelion East on the Central Plateau. Fed by the Dasher and Fisher rivers, it flows 91 miles (146 km) north, east, and again north before entering its estuary at Latrobe, the head of navigation, and emptying into Bass Strait at Devonport. The stream cuts a gorge up to 2,000 feet (600 m) deep into the face of the plateau, where its steeply falling water is harnessed for hydroelectric power. The Mersey is linked with the Forth and Wilmot rivers and supplies water from its main storage reservoir, Lake Rowallan (1968), to hydroelectric-generating plants on the Forth. Named for the English river, the Mersey flows through a timber district before entering its lower valley, which supports dairying, sheep raising, and fruit and potato farming.
