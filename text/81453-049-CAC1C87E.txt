Natural resources law, complex body of national and local laws, having both statutory and common-law components, that regulate the use and protection of natural resources.
Even when resources extend across national boundaries, or when resource exploitation (e.g., depleting a freshwater lake for irrigation and drinking water) has extraterritorial consequences, the governing law will generally be the national law of the area where the resource-affecting activity is taking place. Although calls for responsible global stewardship of natural resources have increased, efforts to control adverse effects upon the global commons tend to operate locally. Ultimately the resources remain subject to national control, although the resource-controlling states can in some circumstances be persuaded to regulate discrete forms of resource-affecting behaviour (e.g., overfishing or trade in endangered species and their by-products).
