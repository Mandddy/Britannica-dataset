Scaramouche, American romantic adventure film, released in 1952, that was based on the 1921 novel of the same name by Rafael Sabatini. It is widely considered a definitive cinematic swashbuckler and features Stewart Granger in one of his greatest roles: the master swordsman Andre Moreau, also known as the clown Scaramouche.
The film takes place in 18th-century France right before the French Revolution. Queen Marie-Antoinette asks master swordsman Noel, the Marquis de Maynes (played by Mel Ferrer), to discover the identity of a controversial pamphleteer called Marcus Brutus. The Marquis finds the culprit and expertly kills him with his sword. The dead man’s friend, Andre Moreau (Granger), subsequently attacks the Marquis, but in the ensuing duel Moreau is humiliated and runs away, vowing to one day take revenge for his friend’s death. He takes refuge with a theatre troupe, disguising himself as a clown called Scaramouche, and begins training diligently with the Marquis’s fencing instructor. Moreau eventually becomes known as one of the best swordsmen in the land. The long-awaited duel comes about when the two men meet at a theatre where Moreau is performing as Scaramouche. The spectacular battle takes them throughout the theatre, over seats and balconies, and lasts some seven minutes. When Moreau finally has the Marquis at his mercy and at the point of death, he finds himself unable to deliver the blow. He later discovers the ultimate twist of fate: the elder Marquis de Maynes is actually his own father, and the man at his mercy is his half-brother.
