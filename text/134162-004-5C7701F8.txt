Aleksander Fredro,  (born June 20, 1793, Surochów, Galicia [now in Poland]—died  July 15, 1876, Lwów, Austrian Galicia [now Lviv, Ukraine]) a major Polish playwright, poet, and author of memoirs whose work is remarkable for its brilliant characterization, ingenious construction, and skillful handling of verse metres.
Born to a wealthy and powerful landed family, Fredro was educated by private tutors. At age 16 he joined the Napoleonic troops of the duchy of Warsaw and subsequently fought for the French in the Napoleonic Wars, including the Moscow campaign. In 1814 he spent a few months in Paris, where he attended plays and studied French drama. After leaving the army in 1815, he returned to his estate, and in 1822 he received from the emperor of Austria the title of count. Upon his return home Fredro began to write theatrical comedies. Among his more notable plays written between 1822 and 1830 are Mąż i żona (produced 1822; Husband and Wife), a comedy of marital infidelity; Śluby panieńskie (1833; Maidens’ Vows), concerned with psychological development; and Zemsta (1834; “Vengeance”), a brilliantly constructed comedy considered to be his masterpiece.
