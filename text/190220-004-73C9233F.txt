Merganser, also called Sawbill, fish duck, or trash duck,  any of several species of Mergus, long-bodied, more or less crested diving ducks; though essentially freshwater birds, they are classified with scoters and goldeneyes in the sea duck tribe, Mergini (family Anatidae, order Anseriformes). They are called trash ducks because their flesh is rank. Except for the rare Brazilian merganser (Mergus octosetaceus), all mergansers live in northern regions. The larger mergansers are seen most often on open reaches of lakes and rivers. The group is characterized by a distinctive narrow bill, with toothlike edges and hooked tip for catching fish.
The common merganser, or goosander (M. merganser), is of mallard size; the male lacks a noticeable crest. It usually nests in hollow trees in north temperate to subarctic regions and migrates to more southerly rivers. The somewhat smaller and ground-nesting red-breasted merganser (M. serrator) has a similar range. In the United States, common and red-breasted mergansers are often called sheldrakes (properly a name for the shelducks).
