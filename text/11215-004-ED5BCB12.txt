Jean Harlow, original name Harlean Harlow Carpenter  (born March 3, 1911, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.—died June 7, 1937, Los Angeles, California) American actress who was the original “Blonde Bombshell.” Known initially for her striking beauty and forthright sexuality, Harlow developed considerably as an actress, but she died prematurely at the height of her career.
The daughter of a prosperous Kansas City dentist, Harlow moved to Los Angeles with her mother after her parents’ separation. Educated at the Hollywood School for Girls and at Ferry Hall Seminary in Highland Park, Illinois, she abruptly quit school when she eloped at age 16. Her marriage broke up in 1928 when, against her husband’s wishes, she embarked upon an acting career. While briefly under contract to comedy producer Hal Roach, she attracted considerable attention with a small but memorable role in the Laurel and Hardy two-reeler Double Whoopee (1929), in which her legendary legs were revealed for the first time on-screen. After making her talking-picture debut in Clara Bow’s The Saturday Night Kid (1929), she caught the eye of industrialist and erstwhile film producer Howard Hughes, who hired her to replace Swedish actress Greta Nissen in the revised talkie version of his silent aviation epic Hell’s Angels (1930). Though her performance was uneven, she created a mild sensation with the now-classic line “Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?”
