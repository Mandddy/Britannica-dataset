Rolls-Royce PLC, major British manufacturer of aircraft engines, marine propulsion systems, and power-generation systems. Noted for much of the 20th century as a maker of luxury automobiles, the company was separated from its car-making operations and nationalized following bankruptcy in 1971. It returned to the private sector in 1987. Headquarters are in London.
Rolls-Royce PLC’s aerospace segment produces an extensive line of civilian and military aircraft engines, both alone and in joint ventures with companies in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Major products include the Trent and RB211 turbofan families (see jet engine) used on Boeing, Airbus, and Tupolev aircraft and the EJ200 turbofan developed for the Eurofighter Typhoon. Rolls-Royce is the world’s leading supplier of marine propulsion equipment. Its products and services range from complete ship design to integrated propulsion, maneuvering, and positioning systems and deck machinery. Other nonaerospace products include aerospace-derived gas turbines for the oil and gas industries and power-generation plants and nuclear power systems for the Royal Navy.
