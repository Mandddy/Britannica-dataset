Chamonix 1924 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in Chamonix, France, that took place Jan. 25â€“Feb. 5, 1924. The Chamonix Games were the first occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
The Chamonix Games were originally staged as International Winter Sports Week, a meet sponsored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) but not sanctioned as an official Olympic Games. Well-organized and equipped with new facilities, the event was a success and led the IOC to amend its charter in 1925, establishing the Winter Games. Chamonix was thereafter recognized as the first Winter Olympics.
