Ale, fermented malt beverage, full-bodied and somewhat bitter, with strong flavour and aroma of hops. Popular in England, where the term is now synonymous with beer, ale was until the late 17th century an unhopped brew of yeast, water, and malt, beer being the same brew with hops added. Modern ale, usually brewed with water rich in calcium sulfate, is made with top-fermenting yeast and processed at higher temperatures than the lager beers popular in the United States. Pale ale has up to 5 percent alcohol content; the darker strong ale contains up to 6.5 percent.
