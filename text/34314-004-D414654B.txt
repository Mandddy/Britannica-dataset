Edward Everett Hale,  (born April 3, 1822, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died  June 10, 1909, Roxbury, Mass.) American clergyman and author best remembered for his short story “The Man Without a Country.”
A grandnephew of the Revolutionary hero Nathan Hale and a nephew of Edward Everett, the orator, Hale trained on his father’s newspaper, the Boston Daily Advertiser, and turned early to writing. For 70 years newspaper articles, historical essays, short stories, pamphlets, sermons, and novels poured from his pen in such journals as the North American Review, The Atlantic Monthly, and Christian Examiner. From 1870 to 1875 he published and edited the Unitarian journal Old and New. “My Double and How He Undid Me” (1859) established the vein of realistic fantasy that was Hale’s forte and introduced a group of loosely related characters figuring in If, Yes, and Perhaps (1868), The Ingham Papers (1869), Sybaris and Other Homes (1869), His Level Best (1872), and other collections. “The Man Without a Country,” which appeared first in The Atlantic Monthly in 1863, was written to inspire greater patriotism during the Civil War. East and West (1892) and In His Name (1873) were his most popular novels.
