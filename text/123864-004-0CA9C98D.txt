Parhelion, also called Mock Sun, or Sun Dog,  atmospheric optical phenomenon appearing in the sky as luminous spots 22° on each side of the Sun and at the same elevation as the Sun. Usually, the edges closest to the Sun will appear reddish. Other colours are occasionally visible, but more often the outer portions of each spot appear whitish.
Parhelia occur when the Sun or Moon shines through a thin cirrus cloud composed of hexagonal ice crystals falling with their principal axes vertical, as opposed to the halo phenomenon that occurs when the principal axes are randomly arranged in a plane perpendicular to the Sun’s or Moon’s rays. The red end of the spectrum, being bent the least, appears on the inside, with the blue, when visible, appearing on the outside. Parhelia most commonly appear during the winter in the middle latitudes. See also halo.
