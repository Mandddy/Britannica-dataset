Pegmatite, almost any wholly crystalline igneous rock that is at least in part very coarse grained, the major constituents of which include minerals typically found in ordinary igneous rocks and in which extreme textural variations, especially in grain size, are characteristic. Giant crystals, with dimensions measured in metres, occur in some pegmatites, but the average grain size of all such rocks is only 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches).
Most bodies of pegmatite are tabular, podlike (cigar-shaped), or irregular in form and range in size from single crystals of feldspar to dikes (tabular bodies injected in fissures) many tens of metres thick and more than a kilometre long; many are intimately associated with masses of fine-grained aplite. Pegmatites occur in all parts of the world and are most abundant in rocks of relatively great geologic age. Some are segregations within much larger bodies of intrusive igneous rocks, others are distributed in the rocks that surround such bodies, and still others are not recognizably associated with igneous rocks.
