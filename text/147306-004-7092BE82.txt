Printed circuit, electrical device in which the wiring and certain components consist of a thin coat of electrically conductive material applied in a pattern on an insulating substrate by any of several graphic arts procedures. After World War II, printed circuits replaced conventional wiring in much electronic equipment, such as radio and television sets, computers and control equipment, and airborne and guided-missile electronic systems. They greatly reduced the size and weight of the equipment while improving reliability and uniformity over the hand-soldered circuits formerly used.
There are many types of printed circuits, including multilayered and double-sided versions, and many corresponding techniques of manufacture. In a basic implementation, an insulating board (e.g., epoxy mixed with fiberglass or paper fibres) is coated with copper, and a protective film is deposited and patterned photographically. The unprotected copper is then etched away in an acid bath. The remaining conductive copper is left intact in the desired pattern of the circuit wiring (the “traces”). Subsequent steps prepare the board for solder attachment of separately manufactured discrete components and integrated circuits.
