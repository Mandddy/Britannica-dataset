Voisin-Farman I, aircraft built by the French aeronautical pioneer Gabriel Voisin for the French aviator Henri Farman in 1907.
Like the Wright brothers’ aircraft, the earliest powered Voisin airplanes were pusher biplanes with elevators located forward of the wings. The first of these machines, completed in March 1907 and sold to engineer and aeronaut Henry Kapferer, never flew. The basic Voisin configuration emerged in their second aircraft, sold to Ferdinand Léon Delagrange. Known as the Voisin-Delagrange I, it was the first Voisin machine to leave the ground, completing six flights, the best of which covered 60 metres (almost 200 feet) in 6 seconds. (After some further modifications, it eventually flew for 500 metres [1,640 feet] in 40 seconds.)
