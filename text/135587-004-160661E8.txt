Reverdy Johnson,  (born May 21, 1796, Annapolis, Md., U.S.—died  Feb. 10, 1876, Annapolis) constitutional lawyer, U.S. senator from Maryland (1845–49, 1863–68), attorney general under President Zachary Taylor (1849–50), and minister to Great Britain (1868–69). Able to grasp either side of an issue, he was called “the Trimmer” for his ability to bring about compromises.
Although he lived in a slave state, Johnson opposed slavery and the annexation of possible slave territory after the Mexican War (1846–48). He helped to keep Maryland in the Union during the American Civil War (1861–65). Nonetheless, he represented the slave-owning defendant in the famous Dred Scott case (1857), in which the U.S. Supreme Court decided that blacks could not be citizens of the United States.
