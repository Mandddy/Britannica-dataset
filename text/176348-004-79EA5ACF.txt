Jason and the Argonauts, American fantasy film, released in 1963, that loosely retells the Greek myth of Jason and features some of the most notable special effects devised by stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen.
Pelias (played by Douglas Wilmer) murders Aristo, his half-brother, to become king of Thessaly. Years later Pelias tries to prevent Aristoâ€™s son, Jason (Todd Armstrong), from making claims to the throne by sending him on a dangerous quest to find the fabled Golden Fleece. Jason and his crew of Argonauts sail for Colchis in the ship Argo and overcome many seemingly insurmountable obstacles to retrieve the Golden Fleece.
