David Letterman,  (born April 12, 1947, Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.) American late-night talk-show personality, producer, and comedian, best known as the host of the long-running Late Show with David Letterman.
After graduating from Ball State University (1969) with a degree in telecommunications, Letterman tried his hand at television as a wisecracking weatherman in Indianapolis. In 1975 he moved to Los Angeles, where he began performing regularly at the Comedy Store, a club for fledgling stand-up comedians. In 1978 he made the first of 22 appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. The following year, Letterman, who had revered Carson since childhood, served as the show’s guest host, the first of many such appearances. In 1979 the visibility Letterman gained as a guest host won him an NBC mid-morning show, The David Letterman Show. However, his unconventional humour—exemplified by the time he sent an audience member out to fetch him coffee—failed to engage daytime viewers. Although it received two Emmy Awards, the show was canceled after three months.
