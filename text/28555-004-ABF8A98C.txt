François de Vendôme, duke de Beaufort,  (born January 16, 1616, Paris—died June 25, 1669, Crete) French prince, one of the leaders of the Fronde (1648–53) and later admiral in the Mediterranean.
Beaufort won a high reputation in King Louis XIII’s army during 1635–40 but linked himself with the opposition to Louis’s minister, Cardinal de Richelieu, and became known as a devoted partisan of the queen, Anne of Austria. In 1642 Beaufort fled to England to avoid interrogation about the conspiracy of Cinq-Mars, but upon Richelieu’s death later that year he promptly returned to France. When Jules Mazarin became head of the government after Louis XIII’s death in 1643, Beaufort, with others, plotted to supplant Mazarin but was arrested (September 1643) and imprisoned.
