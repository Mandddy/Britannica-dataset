Liza Minnelli, in full Liza May Minnelli  (born March 12, 1946, Hollywood, Calif., U.S.) American actress and singer perhaps best known for her role as Sally Bowles in Bob Fosseâ€™s classic musical film Cabaret (1972).
Minnelli was the daughter of film director Vincente Minnelli and iconic entertainer Judy Garland. Initially she set her sights on a career as an ice-skater, but in 1963 she won a supporting role in the Off-Broadway revival of the 1941 musical Best Foot Forward. Her success in that role brought her appearances on a number of television shows, including The Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show, and brought her to the attention of a wider public.
