Arthur Murray, byname of Arthur Murray Teichman   (born April 4, 1895, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died March 3, 1991, Honolulu, Hawaii) American ballroom-dancing instructor and entrepreneur who established a successful mail-order dance-instruction business and, by 1965, more than 350 franchised dance studios, including nearly 50 in foreign countries.
The son of an Austrian-born immigrant baker in Manhattan’s East Harlem, Murray learned ballroom dancing from a girlfriend and from instruction given by the Educational Alliance. He quit his job in an architect’s office, took further lessons at Castle Hall, the dancing school of Vernon and Irene Castle, and soon became a member of the faculty, teaching such new crazes as the bunny hug, grizzly bear, and one-step. He then taught dancing at a resort hotel in Asheville, N.C., studied at the Georgia School of Technology in Atlanta (1918–21), and then established in Atlanta the Arthur Murray Correspondence School of Dancing. It became hugely successful, and headquarters were moved to New York City in 1925, the same year that he married his famous partner, Kathryn Murray (née Kohnfelder).
