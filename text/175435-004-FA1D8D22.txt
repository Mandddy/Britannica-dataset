The Awful Truth, American screwball comedy film, released in 1937, that is widely considered a classic of the genre.
In this adaptation of a play of the same name by Arthur Richman, Cary Grant and Irene Dunne portrayed Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a married couple who agree to a divorce when each mistakenly thinks the other is having an affair. After Lucy moves out, they do in fact take up with new partners—she with an Oklahoma oil baron (played by Ralph Bellamy) and he with a wealthy socialite (Molly Lamont)—and a series of madcap antics ensues as each clumsily tries to sabotage the other’s relationship. The night before the divorce is to be finalized, Jerry and Lucy abscond to her aunt’s cabin and sheepishly reconcile.
