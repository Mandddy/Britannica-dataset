Scottish terrier, also called Scottie ,  short-legged terrier breed often held by its admirers to be the oldest of the Highland terriers, although this contention has not been proved. A small, squat, bewhiskered dog with wide-set, alert-looking eyes, short legs, and a distinctive rolling gait, the Scottie has a hard, wiry coat, which may be black, brindle, gray, grizzled blue-gray, sand-coloured, or wheaten (pale yellowish brown). Adult height is about 10 inches (25 cm), with a weight of 18 to 22 pounds (8 to 10 kg). The breed is usually described as strong and plucky.
