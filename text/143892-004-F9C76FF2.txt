Slump, in geology, downward intermittent movement of rock debris, usually the consequence of removal of buttressing earth at the foot of a slope of unconsolidated material. It commonly involves a shear plane on which a back-tilting of the top of the slumped mass occurs. The plane is slightly concave upward and outward and separates the slump block from unslumped material of the same character. In sedimentary strata the slumping material generally bends elastically until the rock strength is exceeded, when it breaks and moves rapidly. See also sedimentary structure.
