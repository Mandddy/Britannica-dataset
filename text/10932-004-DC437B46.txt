Ralph Hopton, Baron Hopton,  (born 1596, Witham, Somerset, Eng.—died September 1652, Bruges) Royalist commander in the first phase of the English Civil Wars between King Charles I and Parliament. One of the most talented of the king’s generals, he secured southwestern England for the Royalist cause.
After studying at Oxford University and the Middle Temple, London, Hopton served in the army of the Elector Palatine in the early campaigns of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), and in 1624 he entered the House of Commons. As a Puritan, he initially supported Parliament in its conflict with the king. But when Parliament went so far as to claim control over the armed forces (1642), Hopton changed sides and became an ardent Royalist. With the outbreak of the Civil War, the king made him a lieutenant general for western England. Hopton won a brilliant victory at Stratton, Cornwall, in May 1643, and in June he overran the neighbouring county of Devon. He was badly wounded, however, while inflicting a defeat on Sir William Waller at Lansdown, Somerset, on July 5. Waller then had him surrounded at Devizes until Royalist reinforcements broke the siege on July 13.
