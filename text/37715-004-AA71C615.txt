Sir John Morris-Jones, original name (until 1918) John Jones   (born Oct. 17, 1864, Llandrygarn, Anglesey, Wales—died  April 16, 1929, Bangor, Caernarvonshire) teacher, scholar, and poet who revolutionized Welsh literature. By insisting—through his teaching and his writings and his annual adjudication at national eisteddfodau (poetic competitions)—that correctness was the first essential of style and sincerity the first essential of the literary art, he helped restore to Welsh poetry its classical standards.
The eldest son of Morris Jones, a shopkeeper, he gave up the study of mathematics in order to devote his entire time to Welsh language and literature. After graduation from the University of Oxford, Jones became the first professor of Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor. When he was knighted in 1918, he began styling himself Morris-Jones.
