New London, county, southeastern Connecticut, U.S. It is bordered by Long Island Sound (south), Rhode Island (east), and the Connecticut River (southwest). It comprises an upland region that is forested with hardwoods and broken by river valleys, except for the south, which consists of coastal lowlands, and several small islands in the sound. The county is drained by several rivers (notably the Shetucket and Quinebaug rivers) that ultimately drain into the Thames River. There are also numerous small lakes, including Pachaug Pond and Gardner and Rogers lakes. Parklands include Bluff Point Coastal Reserve, Rocky Neck, and Selden Neck state parks and Pachaug and Nehantic state forests. Indian lands are divided into the Mashantucket Pequot, Paucatuck Pequot, and Golden Hill Paugusset reservations.
The Pequot and Mohegan Indians, who inhabited the region, were under joint rule until Uncas—a sachem, or chief—led the Mohegans to independence in the early 1600s. Colonists destroyed the Pequot village near Mystic on June 5, 1637. The county was formed in May 1666 as one of Connecticut’s four original counties and was named for London, England. On September 6, 1781, Benedict Arnold successfully led British forces against Fort Trumbull in New London and Fort Griswold in Groton. Stonington defended itself against British warships in the War of 1812. The county was a centre of whaling, shipbuilding, and maritime trade in the 19th century. The world’s first diesel-powered submarine (1912) and nuclear-powered submarine (1955) were built in Groton. The city of New London contains the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (founded 1876) and Connecticut College (founded 1911).
