Snail-eating snake, any of several members of the Old World subfamily Pareinae and of the New World subfamily Dipsadinae, family Colubridae. All have long delicate teeth; those at the front of the upper jaw are used to seize the body of a snail, whereupon the lower jaw is moved far forward and the lower teeth are used to draw the snail from its shell as the jaw is retracted.
Typically these snakes are small, slender, and large headed, and they are active at night in trees. The roughly 16 species of pareines, often called blunt-headed snakes, are found in southern Asia and in the Philippines. All but one species belong to the genus Pareas. The dipsadines, sometimes called thirst snakes, range from Mexico to Brazil. Members of the main genus, Dipsas (at least 35 species), are rear-fanged. Both pareines and dipsadines are egg layers. Old World snail-eating snakes are not closely related to those of the New World.
