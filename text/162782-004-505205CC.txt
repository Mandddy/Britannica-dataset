Christophe Plantin,  (born c. 1520, Saint-Avertin, France—died July 1, 1589, Antwerp, Belgium) French printer, founder of an important printing house and publisher of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible.
Plantin learned bookbinding and bookselling at Caen, Normandy, and settled in 1549 as a bookbinder in Antwerp. A bad arm wound seems to have led him (about 1555) to turn to typography. His many publications were distinguished by their excellent typography, and he was original in using copper, instead of wood, engravings for book illustrations. His greatest venture, the Biblia regia, which would fix the original text of Old and New Testaments, was supported by Philip II of Spain in spite of clerical opposition and appeared in eight volumes during 1569–72.
