Warner Brothers, in full (1923–69) Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., or (from 1969) Warner Bros. Inc.,  American motion-picture studio that introduced the first genuine talking picture (1927). The company was founded by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack Warner, who were the sons of Benjamin Eichelbaum, an immigrant Polish cobbler and peddler. The brothers began their careers showing moving pictures in Ohio and Pennsylvania on a traveling basis. Beginning in 1903 they started acquiring movie theatres, and they then moved into film distribution. In about 1913 they began producing their own films, and in 1917 they shifted their production headquarters to Hollywood, Calif. They established Warner Brothers Pictures, Inc., in 1923. The oldest of the brothers, Harry (b. Dec. 12, 1881, Poland—d. July 25, 1958, Hollywood, Calif., U.S.), was the president of the company and ran its headquarters in New York City, while Albert (b. July 23, 1884, Poland—d. Nov. 26, 1967, Miami Beach, Fla., U.S.) was its treasurer and head of sales and distribution. Sam (1888–1927) and Jack (b. Aug. 2, 1892, London, Ont., Can.—d. Sept. 9, 1978, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) managed the studio in Hollywood.
When the company ran into financial difficulties in the mid-1920s, Sam Warner persuaded his brothers to collaborate in developing a patent on a process (Vitaphone) that made the “talkies” possible. The studio’s Don Juan (1926) opened with a completely synchronized musical sound track, and The Jazz Singer (1927) had both synchronized music and dialogue. (Sam died only 24 hours before the latter’s premiere.) Warner Brothers then made Lights of New York (1928), the first full-length all-talking film, and On with the Show (1929), the first all-talking colour film. The enormous financial success of these early sound films enabled Warner Brothers to become a major motion-picture studio. By the 1930s Warner Brothers was producing about 100 motion pictures a year and controlled 360 theatres in the United States and more than 400 abroad.
