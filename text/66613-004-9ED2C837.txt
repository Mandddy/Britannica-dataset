Denver, city and county, capital of Colorado, U.S., at the western edge of the Great Plains, just east of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. The city and county were consolidated as a single administrative unit in 1902. Denver lies at the junction of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River; its elevation (5,280 feet [1,609 metres] above sea level at the State Capitol), which gives it the nickname “Mile High City,” and a mild, sunny, dry climate are distinctive characteristics. Metropolitan growth after World War II created a ring of suburban communities, including Arvada, Aurora, Brighton, Broomfield, Cherry Hills Village, Englewood, Lakewood, Littleton, Northglenn, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat Ridge; Golden, about 12 miles (19 km) west of Denver, and Boulder, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest, are also part of the metropolitan region. Greater Denver is at the centre of a string of urban areas that stretches along the Front Range from Fort Collins in the north to Pueblo in the south.
