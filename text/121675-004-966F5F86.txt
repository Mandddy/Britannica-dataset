Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), European Space Agency (ESA) satellite that observed astronomical sources of infrared radiation from 1995 to 1998.
After the spectacular success in 1983 of the short-lived Infrared Astronomical Satellite, which produced the first infrared all-sky survey, the ESA developed ISO to undertake detailed infrared studies of individual objects. ISO was launched by an Ariane 4 rocket on Nov. 17, 1995, and was placed into a highly elliptical 24-hour orbit with a 70,000-km (43,400-mile) apogee so that it spent most of its time both far from terrestrial thermal interference and in communication with the control centre at Villafranca, Spain. The 60-cm (24-inch) telescope had a camera sensitive to infrared radiation at wavelengths in the range of 2.5–17 micrometres and a photometer and a pair of spectrometers that, between them, extended the range out to 200 micrometres. The container of superfluid helium coolant was designed for a baseline mission of 18 months but survived for 28 months. Observations ceased on April 8, 1998, when the temperature of the telescope’s detectors rose above 4 K (−269 °C, or −452 °F), which made detecting sky sources impractical.
