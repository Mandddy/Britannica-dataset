Nocardiosis,  chronic systemic bacterial disease of humans and many other animals originating in the respiratory tract and disseminated by way of the blood to other organs, especially the brain. It is caused either by introduction into the skin or by inhalation of Nocardia asteroides, a normal inhabitant of soil and compost heaps. The disease usually begins with malaise, loss of weight, fever, and night sweats. Most often it causes a cough productive of purulent and blood-tinged sputum (pseudotuberculosis). An uncommon disease, nocardiosis is found worldwide in persons of all ages. Chronic lung disease or immunosuppressive therapy can render an individual more susceptible.
Prolonged treatment with sulfonamide drugs, especially when begun before the disease has spread, has reduced mortality from nocardiosis greatly. If the organism has reached the brain, however, the outlook is still very poor. Amikacin is another drug that is used with patients who do not respond to sulfa drugs.
