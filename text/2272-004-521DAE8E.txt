Destruction of the Maine, (Feb. 15, 1898), an incident preceding the Spanish-American War in which a mysterious explosion sank the U.S. battleship Maine in the harbour of Havana. The destruction of the Maine was one of a series of incidents that precipitated the United States’ intervention in the Cuban struggle for independence from Spain, which had begun in 1895. In January 1898, partly as a conciliatory gesture to the Spanish authorities there and partly to protect the lives and property of U.S. citizens presumably endangered by recent riots, the Maine was sent to Havana harbour. On February 15 an explosion sank the ship, carrying 260 seamen to their deaths. The exact cause of the disaster was never firmly established, though Spain offered to submit the question of its responsibility to arbitration. Nevertheless, certain U.S. newspapers seized upon the incident and coined the popular slogan, “Remember the ‘Maine,’ to hell with Spain!” in an effort to whip up public sentiment in favour of armed intervention, which followed in April.
