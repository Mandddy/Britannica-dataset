Philippe II, duc d’Orléans, also called (until 1701) duc de Chartres  (born August 2, 1674, Saint-Cloud, France—died December 2, 1723, Versailles) regent of France for the young king Louis XV from 1715 to 1723.
The son of Philippe I, duc d’Orléans, and Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Philippe d’Orléans was known as the duc de Chartres during his father’s lifetime. Although he served with the French army against the English and Dutch in the War of the Grand Alliance (1689–97), his uncle, Louis XIV, excluded him from the high military commands to which he considered himself entitled. The duc de Chartres retaliated by studiously neglecting his wife, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, the king’s favourite legitimized daughter. His irreverence, habitual drunkenness, and licentious behaviour earned him an unsavoury reputation by the time he succeeded to his father’s title in 1701. Nevertheless, he was given military commands in Italy (1706) and Spain (1707–08) during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14).
