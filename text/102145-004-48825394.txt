John Edwards, in full John Reid Edwards  (born June 10, 1953, Seneca, South Carolina, U.S.) U.S. senator, who in 2004 was the vice presidential running mate of John Kerry, the Democratic Party’s nominee for president.
He was the son of Wallace Edwards, a textile-mill worker, and Catherine (“Bobbie”) Wade Edwards, a textile worker and later postal worker. He grew up in the mill town of Robbins, North Carolina. The first in his family to attend college, Edwards received a bachelor’s degree in textile management from North Carolina State University in 1974 and a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1977. That year he also married a fellow law student, Elizabeth Anania. Edwards became a successful attorney, first in Nashville, Tennessee, and then in Raleigh, North Carolina, winning multimillion-dollar verdicts in personal-injury lawsuits. The death of his 16-year-old son, Wade, in an automobile accident in 1996 helped to impel Edwards into public service and philanthropy, and in 1998 he was elected to the U.S. Senate from North Carolina.
