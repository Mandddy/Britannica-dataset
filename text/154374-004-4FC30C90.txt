Bandō Tamasaburō V, original name Nirehara Shin’ichi, adoptive name Morita Shin’ichi  (born April 25, 1950, Tokyo, Japan) Japanese Kabuki actor who made a name for himself as an onnagata, a man who plays female roles (in Kabuki all roles are played by men). Somewhat atypically of the Kabuki world, he later gained international acclaim in film and non-Kabuki forms of drama as well.
Although Nirehara Shin’ichi was not born into a performing family, he began studying performance arts at a young age as a form of rehabilitation from polio. At age six he was adopted into the family of Kabuki actor Morita Kan’ya XIV, who had no sons of his own and was looking for a successor. He made his stage debut under the name Bandō Kinoji in 1957, playing the role of Kotarō in the drama Terakoya (“The Temple School”). In 1964 he inherited the prestigious stage name Bandō Tamasaburō, becoming the fifth actor to perform under that moniker. The following year his adoptive father and he performed together as mother and daughter in an adaptation of Chūshingura (“The Treasury of the Loyal Retainers”). In 1969 Tamasaburō won the role of Princess Shiranui in Mishima Yukio’s new Kabuki play Chinsetsu yumiharizuki (“The Moon like a Drawn Bow”). Other notable roles from that period include Princess Taema in Narukami (1970; “The Thunder God”) and Princess Nowake in Sumidagawa gonichi no omokage (1971; “Memories of the Sumida River”).
