The Jungle Book, American animated musical film, released in 1967, that was the last feature film personally overseen by Walt Disney. (It was still in production when he died in 1966.)
The film is very loosely based on the short stories in Rudyard Kiplingâ€™s The Jungle Book. Mowgli (voiced by Bruce Reitherman) is a young boy who, since infancy, has been raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. His safety is threatened, however, when the man-hating tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) returns. The wolves decide to send Mowgli to a human village for his protection, accompanied by the panther Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot). The two encounter many other animals during their journey, including the happy-go-lucky bear Baloo (Phil Harris), the dangerous snake Kaa (Sterling Holloway), and King Louie of the Apes (Louis Prima). Although Mowgli has resisted leaving the jungle, he changes his mind after meeting a young girl and departs to live among his own kind.
