Hugo Stinnes,  (born Feb. 22, 1870, Mülheim, Ger.—died  Apr. 10, 1924, Berlin) German industrialist who emerged after World War I as Germany’s “business kaiser,” controlling coal mines, steel mills, hotels, electrical factories, newspapers, shipping lines, and banks.
At age 20 Stinnes inherited his father’s interest in the family business. Since 1808 the Stinnes family had been operating coal mines, a shipping line to carry the coal up the Rhine River, and a trading house to sell the goods that were carried back. In 1893 Stinnes founded Hugo Stinnes GmbH, which was to become the centre of operations for the Stinnes Konzern (trust) established by his grandfather, Mathias Stinnes. Hugo established the company to consolidate his interests in shipping and mining.
