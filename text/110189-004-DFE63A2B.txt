Roger Clemens, in full William Roger Clemens  (born August 4, 1962, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.) American professional baseball player who was one of the most successful power pitchers in history, thus earning his nickname, “Rocket.” He was the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award seven times.
Clemens was raised in Texas and played college baseball for the University of Texas Longhorns before being drafted in 1983 by the Boston Red Sox. After only one year in the minor leagues, Clemens made his major league debut in 1984. In 1986 he had a record of 24 wins and 4 losses with a league-leading earned run average (ERA) of 2.48, and he helped the Red Sox to the American League pennant. He was awarded his first Cy Young Award and was also voted the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP), a rare double honour for a pitcher. Clemens went on to win two additional Cy Young Awards (1987 and 1991) while playing with the Red Sox.
