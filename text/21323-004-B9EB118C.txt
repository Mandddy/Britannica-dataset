Short-track speed skating, sport that tests the speed, technical skating ability, and aggressiveness of its competitors. Unlike traditional long-track speed skating, contestants race against each other instead of the clock.
Short-track speed skating is rooted in the pack-style racing that was popular in North America during the first part of the 20th century. Amid considerable controversy, this rougher style of speed skating was practiced during the 1932 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, N.Y., U.S. The short-track sport came to prominence in the 1960s and â€™70s. The International Skating Union held annual short-track championships from 1978 to 1980, and the first official world championship took place in 1981. Short-track speed skating made its Olympic debut at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France.
