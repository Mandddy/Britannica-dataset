Ultraviolet astronomy, study of the ultraviolet spectra of astronomical objects. Ultraviolet radiation comes from a hotter region of the electromagnetic spectrum than visible light. For example, interstellar gas at temperatures close to 1,000,000 kelvins is quite prominent in the ultraviolet. It has yielded much important information about chemical abundances and processes in the Sun and certain other stellar objects, such as white dwarfs.
Ultraviolet astronomy became feasible with the advent of rockets capable of carrying instruments above Earth’s atmosphere, which absorbs most electromagnetic radiation of ultraviolet wavelengths (i.e., roughly 100 to 4,000 angstroms) from celestial sources. Much radiation is lost even at the highest altitudes that balloons can reach. During the 1920s, unsuccessful attempts were made to photograph the Sun’s ultraviolet spectrum from balloons; not until 1946 did a rocket-borne camera succeed in doing so.
