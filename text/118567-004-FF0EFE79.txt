Amalienborg, residential square in Copenhagen, Den., built during the reign (1746–66) of King Frederick V and comprising four mansions and the octagonal courtyard surrounded by them. The complex was designed and constructed by the Danish architect Nicolai Eigtved, who also designed numerous other buildings in the surrounding district. At the centre of the court stands a much-admired equestrian statue of Frederick V by the French sculptor Jacques-François-Joseph Saly. Originally the mansions were city residences for nobility. After a fire at the royal residence, Christiansborg Castle, in 1794 the royal family moved to Amalienborg, and they have continued to use the mansions as residences and for state functions. Amalienborg Palace is considered to be one of the finest examples of the Rococo style of architecture in Europe.
