Pradakshina, in Hinduism and Buddhism, the rite of circumambulating in a clockwise direction an image, relic, shrine, or other sacred object. The worshiper, by beginning in the east and keeping the sacred object on his right-hand side, proceeds to the south, thus moving in the direction followed daily by the course of the sun. Pilgrimages sometimes consist of circumambulating an entire town, such as the sacred city of Varanasi (Benares), a 36-mile (58-km) journey, or the Ganges River from source to sea and back, a trip that when undertaken on foot requires several years.
Explanations of the rite vary from the delineation of an area for a particular sacred purpose to an attempt to influence the course of events and produce good fortune by imitating the auspicious journey of the sun. Circumambulating in a counterclockwise movement—i.e., keeping the left shoulder toward the central object—called prasavya, is observed in funeral ceremonies.
