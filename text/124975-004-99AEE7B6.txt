Aishwarya Bachchan Rai, née Aishwarya Rai  (born Nov. 1, 1973, Mangalore, Karnataka state, India) Indian actress whose classic beauty made her one of Bollywood’s premier stars.
Rai was raised in a traditional South Indian home and was pursuing an education in architecture when she was crowned Miss World in 1994. The title put her on the fast track of the modeling business. She landed lucrative jobs with PepsiCo, Inc., and Vogue magazine, and in 2003 she signed on as a spokesmodel for L’Oréal Paris. Her acting career began in earnest with acclaimed performances in Iruvar (1997; The Duo) and …Aur pyaar ho gaya (1997; based on the 1994 American movie Only You). Both films broke from the simplistic structure typical of Bollywood films at the time and helped to push Rai to the forefront of the “New Bollywood.” For decades the Indian film industry had produced a large number of very predictable and clichéd feature films that were enjoyed almost exclusively by South Asians. Changes in Bollywood with regard to financing and production, however, had seen the industry move to improve the artistic quality of its product and to expand its audience beyond South Asia.
