Bowenia, genus of two extant and two extinct species of palmlike cycads (family Stangeriaceae). The genus is endemic to Australia, and both living species are found in Queensland. Both the Byfield fern (Bowenia serrulata) and B. spectabilis are sometimes are cultivated as ornamentals in greenhouses and outdoors in warmer climates.
Bowenia species are tuberous in form and feature a large subterranean stem about 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) long. The evergreen leaves are bipinnately compound. As gymnosperms, the plants produce their seeds in cones, which are borne basally from the underground stem.
