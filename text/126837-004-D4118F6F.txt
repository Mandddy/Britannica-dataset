Charles Bulfinch,  (born Aug. 8, 1763, Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony [U.S.]—died  April 4, 1844, Boston, Mass.) first American professional architect, who gained fame chiefly as a designer of government buildings.
After studying at Harvard University (1778–81), Bulfinch toured Europe (1785–87) and, on the advice of Thomas Jefferson, whom he met in Paris, visited many of the major architectural works of France and Italy. In London he became acquainted with the Neoclassicism of the Scottish-born architect Robert Adam, and he was largely responsible for introducing the Adam style into the United States. Most of his works incorporate classical orders and show a mastery of proportion.
