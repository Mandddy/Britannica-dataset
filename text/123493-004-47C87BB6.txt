Toyotomi Hideyori,  (born Aug. 29, 1593, Ōsaka—died  June 4, 1615, Ōsaka) son and heir of Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–98), the great warrior who unified Japan after more than a century of civil unrest. Hideyori’s suicide at 22 removed the last obstacle to Tokugawa Ieyasu’s bid to establish his own family as the preeminent power in Japan.
Since Hideyori was only five years old when his father died in 1598, the country was actually governed by a council of five warriors whom Hideyoshi had appointed co-regents for his son in the event of his own death. Quarrels among the regents soon erupted in bloodshed, and at the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), Tokugawa Ieyasu emerged as the dominant military power in Japan.
