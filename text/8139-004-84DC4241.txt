American Staffordshire terrier, breed of dog, originally called Staffordshire terrier when registered with American Kennel Club in 1936, that was developed in the United States and based on the smaller British Staffordshire bull terrier. Its ancestry includes the breeds used for bullbaiting and dog fighting. Authorities differ on whether the American Staffordshire terrier and the American pit bull terrier are the same breed, but they agree that properly bred and socialized dogs do not display innate aggression against humans.
In the United States, the American Staffordshire terrier was bred for a stable temperament and adapted for hunting vermin and game and for farm work, taking advantage of the breed’s strength and courage. Over time, larger dogs became the norm. American Staffordshire terriers reached a peak of popularity in the first half of the 20th century; “Pete the Pup” appeared in the Our Gang comedies, and the breed personified the all-American pet. The American Staffordshire terrier is strong, muscular, and stocky, with a broad head and full cheeks. Its “rose” ears (in which the top folds over and back) are sometimes cropped short. It stands 17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm) and weighs 40 to 50 pounds (18 to 22 kg). The stiff, glossy coat may occur in any colour, with or without patches of contrasting colour, and many dogs have some white on the head, throat, and chest. It is affectionate and loyal and is good with children, making it an outstanding family pet.
