Cornelis Tromp,  (born Sept. 9, 1629, Rotterdam—died May 29, 1691, Amsterdam) Dutch admiral, second son of Maarten Tromp. He commanded a series of actions against England, France, and Sweden.
After serving as a lieutenant of his father’s ship in 1645, Cornelis became a captain in 1649. He fought the North African pirates in the Mediterranean (1650) and the British in the First Anglo-Dutch War. After taking part in the Battle of Leghorn (1653) against the English, he was made a rear admiral. He always showed a strong need for independent action and found pleasure in a fiery battle. In 1654 he fought the Algerians and in 1656 sailed to the Baltic to take part in the First Northern War (1655–60) between Sweden and Poland. In 1663 he was appointed commander of the Dutch fleet in the Mediterranean.
