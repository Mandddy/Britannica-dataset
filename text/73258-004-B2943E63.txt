Fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), also called finback whale, razorback whale, or common rorqual,  a slender baleen whale, second in size to the blue whale and distinguishable by its asymmetrical coloration. The fin whale is generally gray with a white underside, but the right side of the head has a light gray area, a white lower jaw, and white baleen at the front of the mouth.
The fin whale is 18–27 metres (59–89 feet) long, with short baleen and 56–100 grooves along its throat and chest. It is found in all the world’s oceans, in groups of a few to several hundred. Some fin whale populations live and feed in temperate waters during the summer and migrate to warmer waters in winter to breed. The fin whale’s diet is unusually diverse for a cetacean, ranging from small crustaceans, such as copepods and krill, to fish and squid.
