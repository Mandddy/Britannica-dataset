Minuteman missile, intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that has been the mainstay of the land-based nuclear arsenal of the United States since the 1960s.
There have been three generations of Minuteman missiles. The Minuteman I was first deployed in 1962. This 17-metre (56-foot), three-staged missile was the first ICBM to use solid fuels, which are safer and more quickly activated than liquid fuels. It was also the first U.S. ICBM to be based in underground silos. (Previous missiles were stored on aboveground launch pads.) Between 1966 and 1973 the Minuteman I was replaced by the Minuteman II. Improved propulsion gave this missile a longer range of about 13,000 km (8,000 miles), and its reentry vehicle, carrying a 1.2-megaton thermonuclear warhead, was equipped with electronic jammers and other devices designed to penetrate radar-directed antiballistic missile defenses around cities and military sites in the Soviet Union.
