National Autonomous University of Mexico, Spanish Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM),  government-financed coeducational institution of higher education in Mexico City, founded in 1551. The original university building, dating from 1584, was demolished in 1910, and the university was moved to a new campus (constructed 1949–52) at Pedregal de San Angel in the southern part of Mexico City, opening in 1954; the campus was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007.
The university was founded as the Royal and Pontifical University by Antonio de Mendoza, the first viceroy of New Spain. From 1553 to 1867, when it was closed by the government of Benito Juárez, the university was controlled by the Roman Catholic church. Although its level of scholarship was originally considered equal to that of other medieval Spanish universities, political and religious interference prevented it from keeping up with the philosophical and scientific innovations that swept Europe from the 17th through the 19th century.
