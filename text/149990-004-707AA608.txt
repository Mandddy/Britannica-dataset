ICANN, in full Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,  nonprofit private organization incorporated in California on September 18, 1998, and tasked with taking over from the U.S. government various administrative duties associated with running the Internet. ICANNâ€™s functions include overseeing the top-level domains (TLDs; e.g., .com, .net, .org, .edu, .us), registering and maintaining the directory of domain names (e.g., www.britannica.com) used in the Internet protocol (IP), and resolving trademark disputes over domain names.
In 1997 U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton signed the Framework for Global Electronic Commerce, directing the Department of Commerce (DOC) to oversee the growth of business over the Internet. Although Clinton emphasized the importance of the private sector in his directive to the DOC, the U.S. government retained ultimate control through the Joint Project Agreement.
