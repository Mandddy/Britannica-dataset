Mawlid, also spelled Mawlūd, or Mīlād,  in Islām, the birthday of a holy figure, especially the birthday of the Prophet Muḥammad (Mawlid an-Nabī).
Muḥammad’s birthday, arbitrarily fixed by tradition as the 12th day of the month of Rabīʿ I, i.e., the day of Muḥammad’s death, was not celebrated by the masses of Muslim faithful until about the 13th century. At the end of the 11th century in Egypt, the ruling Shīʿite Fāṭimids (descendants of ʿAlī, the fourth caliph, through his wife Fāṭimah, Muḥammad’s daughter) observed four mawlids, those of Muḥammad, ʿAlī, Fāṭimah, and the ruling caliph. The festivals, however, were simple processions of court officials, held in daylight hours, that culminated in the recitation of three sermons (khutbahs) in the presence of the caliph.
