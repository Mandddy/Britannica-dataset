Mount Vernon, home and burial place of George Washington, in Fairfax county, Virginia, U.S., overlooking the Potomac River, 15 miles (24 km) south of Washington, D.C. The 18th-century two-story Georgian mansion is built of wood, but the siding is of wide, thick boards paneled so as to give the appearance of cut and dressed stonework. The rooms have been restored as they were when occupied by Washington and his family; most of the furniture pieces on the first floor and all of those in Washington’s bedchamber are originals. Additional Washington relics are in a separate museum building.
From both ends of the house, a curved colonnade leads to a row of outbuildings. A spacious lawn surrounds the mansion, with shaded drives, walks, and gardens. A short distance southwest of the mansion is a plain brick tomb built at Washington’s direction on a site chosen by himself. It contains his remains and those of his wife and of several members of the family (all removed there from the old family vault in 1831).
