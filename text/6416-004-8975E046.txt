Rémy Belleau,  (born 1528, Nogent-le-Rotrou, near Chartres, France—died  March 6, 1577, Paris) Renaissance scholar and poet who wrote highly polished portraits known as miniatures. He was a member of the group called La Pléiade, a literary circle that sought to enrich French literature by reviving classical tradition.
A contemporary of the poet Pierre de Ronsard at the Collège de Cocqueret, Belleau at first gained the patronage of the Abbé Chretophle de Choiseul and later of Charles IX and Henry III, who made him secretary of the king’s chamber. He took part in a campaign against Naples in 1557 and from about 1563 lived at Joinville as tutor and counselor to the Guises, a powerful Catholic family. Living at the Château de Guise inspired Belleau to write La Bergerie (1565–72; “The Shepherd’s Song”), a collection of pastoral odes, sonnets, hymns, and amorous verse. Belleau’s detailed descriptions of nature and works of art earned him a reputation as a miniaturist in poetry and prompted Ronsard to characterize him as a “painter of nature.” His other poetic works include didactic verse; Les Amours et nouveaux échanges des pierres précieuses (1576), a commentary on exotic stones and their inherent secret virtues written in the tradition of the medieval lapidaries; and La Reconnue (1577; “The Rediscovered Daughter”), a comedy in verse based on Plautus’ Casina. His erudite translations of Anacreon’s Odes (1556) won him the seventh seat or “star” in the constellation of La Pléiade, a name the group adopted in imitation of a group of eminent Greek poets of about 250 bc. Belleau’s collected works were edited by A. Gouverneur and published in 1867.
