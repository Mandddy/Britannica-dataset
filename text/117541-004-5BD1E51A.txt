Dab,  any of the flatfishes of the genus Limanda, family Pleuronectidae, found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Dabs are right-eyed flatfishâ€”i.e., the eyes are usually on the right side of the head. The dab of European waters is L. limanda, an abundant and valuable food fish. It is small, usually under 25 cm (10 inches) long, and light brown, with or without dark spots.
Other species include the yellowtail flounder, or rusty dab (L. ferruginea), a reddish brown western Atlantic fish with rust-coloured spots and a yellow tail; the yellowfin sole, or Alaska dab (L. aspera), a brownish northern Pacific flatfish; and the longhead dab (L. proboscidea), a light-spotted, brownish northern Pacific fish with yellow on the edges of its body.
