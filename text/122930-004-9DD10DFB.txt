Chamois (genus Rupicapra), plural chamois or chamoix ,  either of two species of goatlike animal, belonging to the family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), that are native to the mountains of Europe and the Middle East. The two species are the Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica), which is found in the Cantabrian Mountains, Pyrenees, and central Apennines, and the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), which is distributed from the western Alps and the Tatra Mountains to the Caucasus and northern Turkey.
A chamois is about 80 cm (31 inches) tall at the shoulder and weighs 25–50 kg (55–110 pounds). Both sexes possess vertical horns that hook sharply backward at the ends. Males are slightly larger than females. Their colour is relatively variable, but all subspecies of chamois have black and white face markings and a black tail and legs. The chamois is chestnut brown to black in winter and pale brown in summer. In winter, the Pyrenean chamois has two large whitish shoulder patches and a large pale rump patch; it is reddish brown in summer. A thick underfur develops in cold weather.
