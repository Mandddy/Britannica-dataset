Philip Mazzei,  (born December 25, 1730, Poggio a Caiano, Tuscany [Italy]—died March 19, 1816, Pisa, Italy) Italian physician, merchant, and author, ardent supporter of the American Revolution, and correspondent of Thomas Jefferson.
Mazzei studied medicine in Florence and practiced in Turkey before moving in 1755 to London, where he became a wine merchant. In 1773 Mazzei set sail for the American colonies, intending to launch the development of olive and grape growing in Virginia. He established an experimental farm next to Jefferson’s Monticello. Mazzei soon became enveloped in the independence movement, and he strongly favoured Virginia’s strides toward religious and political freedom. In 1779 he accepted a commission from Patrick Henry, the Virginia governor, to seek a loan from the grand duke of Tuscany. After being captured by the British and imprisoned for three months, Mazzei arrived in Europe—only to find his every effort blocked by Benjamin Franklin, who believed that the national government alone could contract foreign debts.
