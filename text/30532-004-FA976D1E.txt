Franz Bopp,  (born Sept. 14, 1791, Mainz, archbishopric of Mainz [Germany]—died  Oct. 23, 1867, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]) German linguist who established the importance of Sanskrit in the comparative study of Indo-European languages and developed a valuable technique of language analysis.
Bopp’s first important work, Über das Conjugationssystem der Sanskritsprache . . . (1816; “On the System of Conjugation in Sanskrit . . .”), foreshadowed his major achievement. In it he sought to trace the common origin of Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, and German, a task never before attempted. Concentrating on a historical analysis of the verb, he assembled the first trustworthy materials for a history of the languages compared. In 1820 he extended the study to include the other grammatical parts.
