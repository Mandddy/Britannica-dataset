Ferruccio Busoni, in full Ferruccio Dante Michelangelo Benvenuto Busoni  (born April 1, 1866, Empoli, Tuscany [now in Italy]—died  July 27, 1924, Berlin, Ger.) pianist and composer who attained fame as a pianist of brilliance and intellectual power.
The son of an Italian clarinetist and a pianist of German descent, Busoni was taught by his mother. He appeared as a child prodigy and later completed his studies in Vienna and Leipzig. In 1889 he became professor of piano at Helsingfors, Fin. (now Helsinki), and from there he moved to Moscow and later to the United States. From 1894 to 1914 (and again from 1920 until his death) he lived in Berlin, conducting a series of orchestral concerts containing music by his contemporaries and making concert tours devoted mainly to Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Liszt. During World War I, divided in his loyalty between Italy and Germany, he retired to Zürich. His most ambitious work was the unfinished opera Doktor Faust, based not on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s work but on earlier versions of the Faust legend. It was completed by his pupil Philipp Jarnach and performed in Dresden in 1925. Two other short operas, Arlecchino and Turandot, composed at Zürich, attempted to revive the commedia dell’arte in modern form. Busoni’s piano works include an immense concerto with choral finale; six sonatinas, which contain the essence of his musical thought; and the great Fantasia Contrappuntistica on an unfinished fugue by Bach (two versions, 1910; one version, 1912; fourth version for two pianos, 1922), which sums up his lifelong experience of Bach’s music.
