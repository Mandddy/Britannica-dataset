Great Northern Railway Company,  American railroad founded by James J. Hill in 1890. It developed out of a struggling Minnesota railroad, the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (SP&amp;P), which Hill and three associates purchased in 1878.
Hill was a Minnesota coal and freight merchant who knew the north country well and believed he could build the decaying SP&amp;P into a great railroad. He extended it north to the Canadian border to link up with a Canadian line to Winnipeg, and then westward through the Dakotas and Montana, reaching Great Falls in 1887 and the Pacific coast at Everett, Wash., in 1893. Hill induced thousands of homesteaders, mostly from Scandinavia, to settle along his tracks as he built them westward. In 1890 the systemâ€™s name was changed to the Great Northern.
