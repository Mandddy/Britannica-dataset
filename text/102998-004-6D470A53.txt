Frank Sargeson, original name Norris Frank Davey  (born March 23, 1903, Hamilton, Waikato, New Zealand—died March 1, 1982, Auckland) novelist and short-story writer whose ironic, stylistically diverse works made him the most widely known New Zealand literary figure of his day.
Davey was born into a conservative Methodist family. His father was a businessman who eventually became the town clerk. Davey studied the law and won admission as a solicitor (1926). After a tour of Europe and a period in London (1927–28), he worked as a clerk at the office of the Public Trust in Wellington, New Zealand. He had made an abortive effort at a novel while abroad, and he ventured into short fiction upon his return. In 1929 he was convicted of the “indecent assault” of a man; the charge regarded a consensual homosexual encounter, then illegal in New Zealand. He served a suspended two-year sentence working on the farm of an uncle, Oakley Sargeson, with whom he was close.
