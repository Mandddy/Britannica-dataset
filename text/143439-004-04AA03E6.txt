Peking University, also called Beijing University, Chinese (Pinyin) Beijing Daxue or (Wade-Giles) Pei-ching Ta-hsüeh, byname Beida,  university in Beijing, one of the oldest and most important institutions of higher learning in China. Its total enrollment is about 35,000.
The school originated as the Capital College, which was founded in 1898 by the Guangxu emperor as part of his short-lived program to modernize and reform China’s institutions. This school languished after the empress dowager Cixi’s coup d’état of the same year. After the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911/12, the school was renamed Peking University. It was subsequently reinvigorated under the guidance of the new president Cai Yuanpei, and by 1920 it had become a centre for the most progressive currents among China’s intelligentsia and students. During the 1920s two founders of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, were on the university’s faculty, and the young Mao Zedong, who began studying Marxism in 1918 under their influence, worked in the university’s library. The noted writer Lu Xun lectured there on Chinese literature in the 1920s.
