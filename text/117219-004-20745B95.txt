Phoenix, U.S. space probe launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Aug. 4, 2007; it landed on May 25, 2008, in the north polar region of Mars. Phoenixâ€™s main objective was to collect and analyze soil samples in order to provide answers to the questions of whether the Martian arctic can support life, what the history of water is at the landing site, and how Martian climate is affected by polar dynamics.
Phoenix more closely resembled the Viking landers of the 1970s than the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in 2004 and roamed their respective landing sites for years. Like the Viking landers, Phoenix was slowed in its descent to the Martian surface by thrusters rather than air bags, which were used by the twin rovers. Phoenix stayed at a single location in the Martian arctic and drilled for rock samples with a 2.35-metre (7.7-foot) robotic arm, the arm placing the samples for analysis in a small self-contained chemistry laboratory. Other instruments included a small weather station and a camera.
