Farman III, aircraft designed, built, and first flown by the French aviator Henri Farman in 1909. (See also history of flight.)
In the early spring of 1909, Farman, the son of English parents living in France, ordered a new airplane from the French aeronautical pioneer Gabriel Voisin. Having earned enormous fame by completing the first circular flight of 1 km (0.6 mile) and the first cross-country flight in an earlier Voisin machine (Voisin-Farman I), Farman specified his own modifications on the new aircraft. For reasons that are unclear, Voisin sold the finished machine ordered by Farman to the English aviator J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon. Farman, together with his brother Maurice Farman, responded by building an improved aircraft for himself.
