Edward Gordon Craig, in full Edward Henry Gordon Craig  (born Jan. 16, 1872, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Eng.—died July 29, 1966, Vence, France) English actor, theatre director-designer, producer, and theorist who influenced the development of the theatre in the 20th century.
Craig was the second child of a liaison between the actress Ellen Terry and the architect Edward William Godwin. Like Edith (the other child of his parents), their son was given the name Craig, which he adopted as a surname. He began his career as an actor, in Henry Irving’s company at the Lyceum Theatre, London, and in several touring companies (1889–97), but he abandoned acting before undertaking his first important designs for productions: Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas (1900) and George Frideric Handel’s Acis and Galatea (1902) for the Purcell Operatic Society and Henrik Ibsen’s The Vikings (1903) for Terry’s company at the Imperial Theatre, London. In his sets, decor, and costumes for these productions, Craig asserted his revolutionary theories of theatrical design. His productions were marked by simplicity and unity of concept, with the emphasis being placed on the movement of actors and of light. But his productions—their artistic impact notwithstanding—were commercial failures, and the financial support that would have permitted him to develop his ideas was not forthcoming in England.
