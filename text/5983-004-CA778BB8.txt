Assumption,  in Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic theology, the notion or (in Roman Catholicism) the doctrine that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was taken (assumed) into heaven, body and soul, following the end of her life on Earth. There is no mention of the Assumption in the New Testament, although various texts are frequently adduced to demonstrate the appropriateness of the doctrine, the imagery of which is related to the Ascension of Jesus into heaven. Theologically, the doctrine means that Mary’s redemption involved a glorification of her complete personality and anticipated the state promised to the rest of humankind.
The doctrine’s development is closely related to a feast devoted to Mary that passed from a general celebration in her honour to one celebrated on August 15 commemorating her dormition, or falling asleep. The feast, which originated in the Byzantine Empire, was brought to the West, where the term Assumption replaced the earlier title to reflect increased emphasis on the glorification of Mary’s body as well as her soul. Although the dormition of Mary had been a frequent iconographic theme in the East, the theme of the Assumption was less prevalent there. An unwillingness to accept apocryphal (noncanonical and unauthentic) accounts of the Assumption caused some hesitation, but by the end of the European Middle Ages there had been a general acceptance of the notion in both the East and the West.
