College of William &amp; Mary, state coeducational university of liberal arts at Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S. The second oldest institution of higher education in the United States (after Harvard College), it was chartered in 1693 by co-sovereigns King William III and Queen Mary II of England to develop clergymen and civil servants for the colony. The scholastic honour society Phi Beta Kappa was organized there as a social fraternity in 1776. Seven signers of the Declaration of Independence (including its author, Thomas Jefferson), U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, and President James Monroe were college alumni, as were President John Tyler, General Winfield Scott, and statesman John Randolph. George Washington was the college’s first American chancellor (1788–99).
In the period after the American Revolution and under the influence of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, William &amp; Mary reformed its curriculum. Two divinity professorships were dropped, and the study of law, political economy, history, mathematics, and modern languages, particularly French, was emphasized. Jefferson was instrumental in this process of secularization. William &amp; Mary pioneered the elective system (allowing students to choose their own programs). In 1906 the college became state-supported, and women were first admitted in 1918. The school acquired university status in 1967.
