Chandra X-ray Observatory, U.S. satellite, one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) fleet of “Great Observatories” satellites, which is designed to make high-resolution images of celestial X-ray sources. In operation since 1999, it is named in honour of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, a pioneer of the field of stellar evolution.
Chandra was preceded by two X-ray satellites, the U.S. Einstein Observatory (1978–81) and the multinational Röntgensatellit (1990–99), which produced surveys across the entire sky of sources emitting at X-ray wavelengths. Chandra (originally known as the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility) was designed to study individual sources in detail. Following deployment by the space shuttle Columbia on July 23, 1999, a solid-rocket stage boosted the observatory into a highly elliptical orbit with an apogee, or farthest position from Earth, of 140,000 km (87,000 miles) and a perigee, or closest position to Earth, of 10,000 km (6,200 miles) in order to remain above the worst interference by Earth’s radiation and to provide long periods of uninterrupted study of almost any part of the sky.
