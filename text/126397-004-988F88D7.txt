Gag rule,  in U.S. history, any of a series of congressional resolutions that tabled, without discussion, petitions regarding slavery; passed by the House of Representatives between 1836 and 1840 and repealed in 1844. Abolition petitions, signed by more than 2,000,000 persons, had inundated Congress after the establishment of the American Anti-Slavery Society (1833). Gag rules, supported by proslavery congressmen, postponed the consideration, printing, and referral of such petitions. Repeal was secured by a House group led by the former president John Quincy Adams and Joshua R. Giddings.
