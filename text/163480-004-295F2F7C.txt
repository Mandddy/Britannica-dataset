Gustav, count von Alvensleben-Erxleben,  (born September 30, 1803, Eichenbarleben, Prussia [Germany]—died June 30, 1881, Gernrode, Ger.) Prussian general and adjutant general who was the chief personal adviser to King (later Emperor) William I.
As a member of the Prussian general staff (1847–58), Alvensleben participated in the suppression of the revolution of 1849 in Baden and was named chief of staff for the troops that remained in occupation. In 1854 he held a similar position in the military government of the Rhineland. Promoted to major general in 1858 and adjutant general in 1861, he acquired considerable influence in the military cabinets and personal counsels of William I. Dispatched to St. Petersburg in 1863, Alvensleben negotiated a convention that provided for Prussian-Russian cooperation in the suppression of insurrections in their subject Polish lands. Faced with the concerted opposition of the Western powers, however, this agreement, known as the Alvensleben Convention (1863), was repudiated by the Prussian government and allowed to pass into oblivion. Subsequently appointed lieutenant general (1863) and general of the infantry (1868), Alvensleben saw service in the Franco-German war (1870–71) as head of the 3rd Army Corps.
