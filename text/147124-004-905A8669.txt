Aḥmadiyyah, also spelled Ahmadiyya,  modern Islamic sect and a name shared by several Sufi (Muslim mystic) orders. The sect was founded in Qādiān in the Punjab, India, in 1889 by Mīrzā Ghulām Aḥmad (c. 1839–1908), who claimed to be the mahdī (a figure expected by some Muslims at the end of the world), the Christian Messiah, an incarnation of the Hindu god Krishna, and a reappearance (burūz) of Muhammad. The sect’s doctrine is unorthodox in some aspects: for example, it is believed that Jesus feigned death and resurrection but in actuality escaped to India, where he died at the age of 120; also, jihād (“holy war”) is reinterpreted as a battle against unbelievers to be waged by peaceful methods rather than by violent military means.
On the death of the founder, Mawlawi Nur al-Din was elected by the community as khalīfah (“successor”). In 1914, when he died, the Aḥmadiyyah split—the original group, which was based in Qādiān and recognized Ghulām Aḥmad as prophet (nabī) and his son Ḥaḍrat Mīrzā Bashīr al-Dīn Maḥmūd Aḥmad (born 1889) as the second caliph, and the new Lahore society that accepted Ghulām Aḥmad only as a reformer (mujaddid).
