Cutthroat trout,  (Oncorhynchus clarki), black-spotted game fish, family Salmonidae, of western North America named for the bright-red streaks of colour beneath the lower jaws. It strikes at flies, baits, and lures and is considered a good table fish. Size is usually up to 2 to 4 kg (4.4 to 8.8 pounds), but some specimens may reach 10 kg (22 pounds). Many cutthroat trout migrate to sea when it can be reached. These, like the oceanic forms of other species, are called sea trout and may not reenter fresh water for several years. The numerous subspecies, such as the Tahoe, yellowfin, and Yellowstone trout, are also marked with red.
