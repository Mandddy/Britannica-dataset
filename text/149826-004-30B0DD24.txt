Mike Huckabee, byname of Michael Dale Huckabee  (born August 24, 1955, Hope, Arkansas, U.S.) American politician, who served as governor of Arkansas (1996–2007) and who ran for the 2008 and 2016 Republican presidential nomination.
The first male member of his family to finish high school, Huckabee graduated from Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, in 1975 and received a master’s degree from the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1980. He then became an ordained Baptist minister and spent the next decade as a pastor in various Arkansas churches and as an executive in local media companies. Huckabee’s interest in serving a larger public role was stoked in 1989 when he was elected president of the Arkansas Baptist Convention. He turned to politics in 1992 but lost his bid for the U.S. Senate. The following year Huckabee won a special election to fill Arkansas’s vacant lieutenant governor’s seat after the previous tenant, Jim Guy Tucker, became governor following Bill Clinton’s ascent to the presidency. Tucker’s resignation in 1996 made Huckabee only the third Republican governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction (1865–77). He was reelected to full terms in 1998 and 2002.
