AZT, in full azidothymidine, also called zidovudine,  drug used to delay development of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in patients infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). AZT belongs to a group of drugs known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). In 1987 AZT became the first of these drugs to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of prolonging the lives of AIDS patients.
AZT is only active against HIV when the virus is replicating into proviral DNA (viral DNA synthesized prior to integration into host DNA). This is because the active compound of AZT, known as zidovudine 5-triphosphate, has a high affinity (attraction) for an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is used by retroviruses such as HIV to replicate viral single-stranded RNA (ribonucleic acid) into proviral double-stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Zidovudine 5-triphosphate is similar in structure to thymidine triphosphate, which is normally produced by cells and is one of several nucleoside compounds (structural units of nucleic acids) needed to synthesize DNA. However, zidovudine 5-triphosphate has a greater affinity for reverse transcriptase than thymidine triphosphate, and it contains a nitrogen group (an azide; N3) in place of the usual nucleoside hydroxyl group (âˆ’OH). As a result, reverse transcriptase incorporates zidovudine 5-triphosphate into growing strands of HIV proviral DNA, and DNA synthesis and replication are terminated, since subsequent nucleosides cannot bind to the nitrogen group of zidovudine 5-triphosphate.
