Skeleton shrimp,  any of certain marine crustaceans of the family Caprellidae (order Amphipoda), particularly of the genera Caprella and Aeginella. The common name derives from the slender body structure. Most species are predators on other small animals, but some feed on organic debris.
Aeginella longicornis (longicornia), which occurs among eelgrass, sponges, and wharf pilings between Labrador and the mid-Atlantic coast of the United States, is about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long and muddy green or brown in colour. Like most other skeleton shrimp, it moves with a high-arching action similar to that of the measuring worm.
