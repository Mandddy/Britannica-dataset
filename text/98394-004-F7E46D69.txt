Newt Gingrich, in full Newton Leroy Gingrich, original name Newton Leroy McPherson  (born June 17, 1943, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American politician, who served as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives (1995–98); he was the first Republican to hold the office in 40 years. He later sought the party’s nomination for president in 2012.
McPherson’s parents divorced, and he later took the surname of his mother’s second husband. After graduating from Emory University (1965), Gingrich studied modern European history at Tulane University (M.A., 1968; Ph.D., 1971) and taught at West Georgia College (1970–78). After unsuccessful runs for the U.S. Congress in 1974 and 1976, he won a seat from a district outside Atlanta in 1978. Gingrich quickly became known for his confrontational manner and conservative policies. In 1987 he attacked Speaker of the House Jim Wright for questionable financial dealings; the charges forced Wright to resign in 1989. That same year, Gingrich was narrowly elected House minority whip by his Republican colleagues with a vote of 87–85.
