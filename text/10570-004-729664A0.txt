Kandahār, also spelled Qandahār,  city in south-central Afghanistan. It lies on a plain next to the Tarnak River, at an elevation of about 3,300 feet (1,000 metres). It is southern Afghanistan’s chief commercial centre and is situated at the junction of highways from Kabul, Herāt, and Quetta (Pakistan). Kandahār has an international airport, though it has traditionally been used for domestic flights.
The strategic and commercial importance of the site, on main routes via Herāt to Central Asia, to Kabul, and to India, explains its long history of conquests and frequent refoundings. The city was included in the Achaemenian dynasty by Darius I, was taken by Alexander the Great in 329 bc, was surrendered by Seleucus I (Nicator) to Chandragupta in 305 bc and dignified by a rock inscription in Greek and Aramaic by his grandson Ashoka, and thereafter was successively held by Greco-Bactrians, Parthians, Śakas, Kushāns, and Sāsānians. During its Islamic period, Kandahār was held by a succession of various Arab, Persian, Turkic, and Mongol overlords. It fell under Arab rule in the 7th century ad, under the Ṣaffārid dynasty in the 9th, and under the Ghaznavid dynasty in the 10th. Kandahār was destroyed by the Mongol invader Genghis Khan and again by the Turkic conqueror Timur (Tamerlane), after which it was held by the Mughal dynasty (16th century) and the Persians (17th century). In 1747 it became the first capital of a unified Afghanistan. From 1839 the British sought control of the area but finally lost it in September 1881. The subsequent history of Kandahār has been no less eventful; in the 1980s, during the Afghan War, Kandahār was the scene of intermittent fierce fighting between Afghan rebels and Soviet invasion forces. From the mid-1990s until its overthrow in 2001 the Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist faction that controlled much of Afghanistan, had its headquarters there. Afterward it was a staging area for U.S. military strikes against Islamic militants.
