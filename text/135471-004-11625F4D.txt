Charles Stewart Parnell,  (born June 27, 1846, Avondale, County Wicklow, Ire.—died Oct. 6, 1891, Brighton, Sussex, Eng.) Irish Nationalist, member of the British Parliament (1875–91), and the leader of the struggle for Irish Home Rule in the late 19th century. In 1889–90 he was ruined by proof of his adultery with Katherine O’Shea, whom he subsequently married.
During Parnell’s youth, the anti-British traditions and atmosphere of his home were significantly different from those of the majority of the Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning class to which he belonged. They did not, however, prevent his parents from giving him an education normal for his class. He went to three English boarding schools, where he seems to have been unhappy, and to Cambridge, where in 1869, after an undistinguished career, he was suspended for a relatively minor breach of discipline and decided not to return.
