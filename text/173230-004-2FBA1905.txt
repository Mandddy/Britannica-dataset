Ermanno Olmi,  (born July 24, 1931, Treviglio, Bergamo, Italy) Italian motion-picture director whose formative work examines life in the business world and whose later films explore religious and social themes.
Olmi attended a science high school and took courses in acting at the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Milan. He learned filmmaking while employed at Edisonvolta, a major Milanese electric company. There he directed more than 40 short informational films and company documentaries from 1952 to 1961. His first feature-length film was Il tempo si è fermato (1959; Time Stood Still), an analysis of the relationship between two guards forced to spend the winter together in inactivity. The success of this film led to the formation of 22 December S.p.A., a production company cofounded by Olmi that distributed his first commercial feature film, Il posto (1961; The Job, or The Sound of Trumpets), a melancholy story of a young man’s isolation. His next effort was I fidanzati (1962; The Fiances, or The Engagement), which portrays the difficulties of a young Milanese couple during a temporary work assignment in Sicily.
