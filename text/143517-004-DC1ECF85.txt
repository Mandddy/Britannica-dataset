Castorocauda, genus of extinct beaverlike mammals known from fossils dated to the Middle Jurassic (175.6 million to 161.2 million years ago) of China. Classified in the extinct order Docodonta, Castorocauda weighed 500 to 800 grams (1.1 to 1.8 pounds), almost as large as living platypuses, making it the largest Jurassic mammal known.
Castorocauda was found in the Jiulongshan Formation (which is also called the Haifanggou Formation) of China, which preserved a nearly complete skeleton and skull, along with carbonized impressions of the skin and hair. Like living mammals, it had integument with an undercoat and guard hairs. Although it was not directly related to living beavers, it possessed a broad and flat tail with a scaly covering. In addition to this swimming specialization, Castorocauda also had adaptations for digging. The dentition indicates a carnivorous, fish-eating diet.
