Shanghai Museum, Chinese (Pinyin) Shanghai Bowuguan ,  museum in Shanghai founded in 1952 that contains some 120,000 objects, considered one of the finest collections of art in China. In 1996 the museum was relocated to the People’s Square in the city centre and was reopened. The new building was designed to symbolize the ancient Chinese concept of tianyuan difang (“round sky, square earth”). It has five levels above ground and two below. Its 11 principal galleries contain bronzes, sculptures, ceramics, jades, paintings, calligraphy, seals, numismatics, furniture of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and arts and crafts by Chinese minority ethnic groups. The displays are arranged in chronological order. Items exhibited include weapons, cauldrons, utensils, and tools; ceramics from the Neolithic era to the present include examples of Longshan Black Pottery. Also on display are life-size terra-cotta statues of a horse and two warriors from the tomb of the Qin emperor Shihuangdi, northeast of Xi’an (Sian). Pottery from the Tang dynasty and some fine blue-and-white Ming vases are also exhibited, as are tools used in painting and calligraphy, with some scrolls from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.
