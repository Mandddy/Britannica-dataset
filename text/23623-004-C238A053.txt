Marc Andreessen,  (born July 9, 1971, Cedar Falls, Iowa, U.S.) American-born software engineer who played a key role in creating the Web browser Mosaic and who cofounded Netscape Communications Corporation.
While still in grammar school, Andreessen taught himself BASIC, a programming language, so that he could write his own computer games; he later attempted to design a program that would do his math homework. He planned on becoming an electrical engineer, but that changed when he entered the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and landed a part-time job at the schoolâ€™s computer lab, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). There, he and a handful of his peers created Mosaic, a user-friendly browser application that integrated graphics and point-and-click simplicity to make it easier for nontechnical people to navigate the Web. Mosaic was a huge success. NCSA made it available free of charge over the Internet, and more than two million copies were downloaded within a year.
