Slavic languages, also called Slavonic languages,  group of Indo-European languages spoken in most of eastern Europe, much of the Balkans, parts of central Europe, and the northern part of Asia. The Slavic languages, spoken by some 315 million people at the turn of the 21st century, are most closely related to the languages of the Baltic group (Lithuanian, Latvian, and the now-extinct Old Prussian), but they share certain linguistic innovations with the other eastern Indo-European language groups (such as Indo-Iranian and Armenian) as well. From their homeland in east-central Europe (Poland or Ukraine), the Slavic languages have spread to the territory of the Balkans (Bulgarian; Macedonian; Slovene; Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian, and sometimes Montenegrin [sometimes grouped together as Serbo-Croatian]), central Europe (Czech and Slovak), eastern Europe (Belarusian, Ukrainian, Russian), and the northern parts of Asia (Russian). In addition, Russian is used as a second language by most inhabitants of the countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Some of the Slavic languages have been used by writers of worldwide significance (e.g., Russian, Polish, Czech), and the Church Slavonic language remains in use in the services in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
The Slavic language group is classified into three branches: the South Slavic branch, with two subgroups—Serbian-Croatian-Slovene and Bulgarian-Macedonian; the West Slavic branch, with three subgroups—Czech-Slovak, Sorbian, and Lekhitic (Polish and related tongues); and the East Slavic branch, comprising Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian.
