Jerry Brown, in full Edmund G. Brown, Jr.  (born April 7, 1938, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.) American Democratic politician who served as governor of California (1975–83; 2011– ), mayor of Oakland, Calif. (1999–2007), and California’s attorney general (2007–11).
Brown was one of the four children of Edmund G. Brown, who served as governor of California from 1959 to 1967. The younger Brown attended both public and parochial schools as a child, and in 1956, after spending a year at the University of Santa Clara, he transferred to the Jesuit seminary Sacred Heart Novitiate. In 1958 he took the vows of a clergyman. However, he left the seminary in 1960 to enroll at the University of California at Berkeley, where he majored in classics (B.A., 1961). He spent time abroad before receiving a law degree from Yale University in 1964, then clerked for California Supreme Court Justice Mathew Tobriner. By the late 1960s Brown was living in Los Angeles and working for the law firm Tuttle &amp; Taylor. He was elected to the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees in 1969, and the following year he was elected secretary of state for California. During his four-year tenure, he drafted and championed the California Fair Political Practices Act (passed in 1974).
