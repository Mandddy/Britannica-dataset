Karl Radek, in full Karl Bernhardovich Radek, original name Karl Sobelsohn  (born 1885, Lemberg, Galicia, Austria-Hungary [now Lviv, Ukraine]—died 1939?) communist propagandist and early leader of the Communist International (Comintern) who fell victim to Joseph Stalin’s Great Purge of the 1930s.
A member of a Galician Jewish family, Radek attended the universities of Kraków and Bern. Having joined the Social Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania in 1901, he participated in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and subsequently spent a year in a Russian prison. He then worked on the editorial staffs of left-wing Social Democratic newspapers in Poland and Germany, acquiring a reputation as an intelligent, witty political writer.
