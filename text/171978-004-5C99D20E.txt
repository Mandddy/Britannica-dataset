William Hayward Pickering,  (born December 24, 1910, Wellington, New Zealand—died March 15, 2004, La Cañada Flintridge, California, U.S.) New Zealand-born American engineer, physicist, and head of the team that developed Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite. He played a leading role in the development of the U.S. space program.
Pickering attended Canterbury University in New Zealand before moving to the United States in 1929; he became a U.S. citizen in 1941. He studied at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena (B.S. 1932, M.S. 1933, Ph.D. 1936) and joined the staff of the institute in 1936. Working under the American physicist Robert A. Millikan, Pickering developed cosmic-radiation-detection gear for high-altitude balloon flights. In 1944 he became a section chief of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he developed the first telemetry system used in U.S. rockets. He was manager of the Corporal rocket project, which brought about important early advances in guidance and communication techniques.
