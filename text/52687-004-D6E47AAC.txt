Redbud (genus Cercis), any of a genus of 10 species of shrubs to small trees in the pea family (Fabaceae), native to North America, southern Europe, and Asia and widely planted for their showy early spring flowers. Clusters of small purplish pink flowers appear on old stems and branches before the leaves. The heart-shaped to roundish leaves are bronzy as they unfurl but soon become bright green, turning to yellow in fall.
The eastern redbud (Cercis canadensis), up to 12 metres (40 feet) tall, is the hardiest species. It is cultivated for its rosy-purple spring flowers and interesting branch patterns; a white-flowered variety is available. The Chinese redbud (C. chinensis) is often shrubby in cultivation. Another redbud, C. siliquastrum, from the Mediterranean region, is often called Judas tree, for the betrayer of Christ, who is said to have hanged himself from such a tree, after which the white flowers turned red with blood or shame.
