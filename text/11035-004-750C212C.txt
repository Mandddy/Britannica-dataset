Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt,  (born Nov. 14, 1668, Genoa—died  Nov. 16, 1745, Vienna) Austrian Baroque architect and military engineer whose work strongly influenced the architecture of central and southeastern Europe in the 18th century. The types of buildings he developed for parish churches, chapels, villas, garden pavilions, palaces, and houses were much imitated, spreading his architectural principles throughout and beyond the Habsburg empire.
Born in Italy of German parents, Hildebrandt studied architecture, town planning, and military engineering in Rome. He joined the Austrian Imperial Army as a fortification engineer and participated (1695–96) in three Piedmontese campaigns under Prince Eugene of Savoy, afterward moving to Vienna and turning to civil architecture. In 1700 he was appointed court engineer and employed as an architect by Prince Eugene and other Austrian aristocrats, in Vienna, in Salzburg, and in southern Germany.
