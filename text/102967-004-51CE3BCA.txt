Repertory theatre, system of play production in which a resident acting company keeps a repertory of plays that are always ready for performance, often presenting a different one each night of the week, supplemented by the preparation and rehearsal of new plays.
Repertory in its true form has existed in state-supported theatres in France, Germany, and elsewhere; but, as it is rather expensive and difficult to maintain, most modern repertory companies use a modification of the system, usually presenting fewer and longer-running plays, alternately or successively, in one season. Repertory theatre has proved effective in supporting both commercially successful and experimental drama. It has served as a showcase for the early work of playwrights such as Eugene Oâ€™Neill and John Millington Synge and as a training ground for young actors. It is a popular format for summer festivals as well as national theatres.
