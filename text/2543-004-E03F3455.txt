Christopher G. Memminger,  (born Jan. 9, 1803, Nayhingen, Württemberg—died  March 7, 1888, Charleston, S.C., U.S.) Confederate secretary of the treasury, generally held responsible for the collapse of his government’s credit during the American Civil War.
Soon after his father’s death while a soldier in Germany, Memminger immigrated to the United States and settled with his mother in Charleston, S.C. In 1819 Memminger was graduated from South Carolina College, began to study law, and subsequently went on to become a successful attorney. By 1830 he was emerging as a prominent public figure, notable for his opposition to the nullification movement in South Carolina. Elected to the state legislature in 1836, he served as chairman of the finance committee and actively sought to force banks to maintain specie payments. During his legislative career, Memminger gained a reputation as a sound financier.
