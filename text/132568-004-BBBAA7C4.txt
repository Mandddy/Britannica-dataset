Edward A. Filene, in full Edward Albert Filene   (born September 3, 1860, Salem, Massachusetts, U.S.—died September 26, 1937, Paris, France) American department-store entrepreneur, philanthropist, and social reformer.
His father, William Filene (originally Filehne), emigrated from Prussia to the United States in 1848, opened (and closed) a series of stores in Massachusetts and New York, and finally, in 1881, set up a retail “specialty store” in Boston. In 1891 the prosperous department store was turned over to his sons, Edward and Lincoln, and then renamed William Filene’s Sons Company. Edward Filene became president and was in charge of overall company policy and merchandising. His most famous and profitable innovation was the Automatic Bargain Basement, to which slow-selling goods were relegated after they had failed to sell upstairs in a designated period of time. In 1928, in an internal power struggle, he lost all control of Filene’s, retaining only the titular role of president.
