John Leland, Leland also spelled Leyland  (born c. 1506, London—died April 18, 1552, London) chaplain and librarian to King Henry VIII. He was the earliest of a notable group of English antiquarians.
Leland was educated at St. Paul’s School and Christ’s College, Cambridge (B.A., 1522), later studying at All Souls’ College, Oxford, and in Paris. He took holy orders and by 1530 was chaplain and librarian to Henry VIII; the special position of king’s antiquary was created for him in 1533, and he was authorized to search cathedral and monastic libraries for manuscripts of historical interest. Probably from 1534 and certainly from 1536 to 1542 he was engaged on an antiquarian tour of England and Wales. He supported Henry VIII’s church policy (though the havoc that resulted among the monastic manuscripts at the dissolution of the monasteries caused him great distress), and his loyalty was rewarded with his presentation to the rectory of Haseley in Oxfordshire, a canonry at King’s College (afterward Christ Church), Oxford, and a prebend at Salisbury. But he resided mainly in London, where he was certified insane in March 1550. He did not regain his reason before he died.
