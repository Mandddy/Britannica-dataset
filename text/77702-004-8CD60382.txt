Fejér, megye (county), central Hungary, occupying an area in the eastern portion of Transdanubia. It is bordered by the counties of Komárom-Esztergom to the north, Pest and Bács-Kiskun to the east, Tolna to the south, and Veszprém and Somogy to the west. Székesfehérvár is the county seat. Other major cities and towns include Dunaújváros, Bicske, Gárdony, Mór, and Sárbogárd. The presence of the Danube River along much of the county’s eastern border contributes to Fejér’s standing as an important transportation hub.
The southern half of the county lies in the Mezőföld, a rolling fertile area of loess soils where corn (maize), wheat, barley, sugar beets, potatoes, and peas are the main crops. Fejér is the country’s major producer of corn. Sunflower seeds are grown for oil, and orchards lie along the Danube and other watercourses. In the northern half of the county, fodder crops are declining in importance as the Budapest market area (to the northeast) demands more vegetables, fruits, and meats.
