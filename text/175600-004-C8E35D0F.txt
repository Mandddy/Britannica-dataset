After serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, he acted for several years in films, including bit parts in A Guy Named Joe (1943), Thirty Seconds over Tokyo (1944), and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946). In the late 1940s he turned his attention to screenwriting, contributing first to the screenplay for Panhandle (1948) and then to the Mickey Rooney vehicles All Ashore (1953) and The Atomic Kid (1954). Along the way he created the hit radio series Richard Diamond, Private Detective for Dick Powell.
