August Pott, in full August Friedrich Pott  (born November 14, 1802, Nettelrede, Hanover [Germany]—died July 5, 1887, Halle, Germany) German linguist who was one of the founders of Indo-European historical linguistics. He established modern etymological studies on the basis of the correspondence of sounds occurring in related words in Indo-European languages.
As a theology student at the University of Göttingen, Pott became interested in philology. In 1827, while teaching at the gymnasium at Celle, he completed his doctoral dissertation, De Relationibus Quae Praepositionibus in Linguis Denotantur (1827; “Concerning the Relations That Are Denoted in Languages by Prepositions”). That same year he went to the University of Berlin to study with Franz Bopp, one of the most important early scholars of Indo-European linguistics, and in 1830 he became an unsalaried lecturer in general linguistics at the university.
