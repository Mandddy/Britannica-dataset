Roundell Palmer, 1st earl of Selborne,  (born Nov. 27, 1812, Mixbury, Oxfordshire, Eng.—died  May 4, 1895, near Petersfield, Hampshire) British lord high chancellor (1872–74, 1880–85) who almost singlehandedly drafted a comprehensive judicial-reform measure, the Supreme Court of Judicature Act of 1873. Under this statute, the complex duality of English court systems—common law and chancery (equity)—was largely abolished in favour of a single hierarchy of courts. All divisions of the new supreme court were empowered to apply equitable as well as common-law remedies, with the principles of equity prevailing in the event of conflict.
A successful equity lawyer and a member of the House of Commons (1847–52, 1853–57, 1861–72), Palmer served as solicitor general (1861–63) and attorney general (1863–65). In April 1868 he voted with a Commons minority against resolutions for disestablishing the Church of Ireland, introduced by William Ewart Gladstone, then chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the House of Commons. Later that year, Gladstone, the newly appointed prime minister, offered Palmer the lord chancellorship, which he declined. Four years later, however, he accepted the office from Gladstone and was created Baron Selborne. In 1882, when Queen Victoria formally turned over to him the new law court building in London, he received an earldom. He was one of the few ministers to urge the relief of General Charles George (“Chinese”) Gordon’s garrison at Khartoum, the Sudan, besieged (1884–85) by the Mahdist revolutionaries. In 1885 he finally broke with Gladstone over the prime minister’s conversion to the principle of Irish Home Rule.
