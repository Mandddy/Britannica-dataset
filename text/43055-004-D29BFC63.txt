Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger,  (born November 14, 1779, Vesterbro, Denmark—died January 20, 1850, Copenhagen) poet and dramatist who was a leader of the Romantic movement in Denmark and traditionally has been considered the great Danish national poet.
Oehlenschläger’s father was organist and then steward at Frederiksberg castle near Copenhagen. In his youth Oehlenschläger attended a school directed by the poet Edvard Storm, a Norwegian known for patriotic poetry and drinking songs. After a short career as an actor, Oehlenschläger entered the University of Copenhagen to study law, but turned to writing. He wrote his famous poem “Guldhornene” (1802; “The Golden Horns”), about the loss of two golden horns symbolizing a union of past and present, after his meeting with the Norwegian scientist and philosopher Henrik Steffens, who was eager to spread the doctrine of German Romanticism in Denmark. The ideals of Steffens gave Oehlenschläger the courage to break with 18th-century literary traditions, and “Guldhornene” marks this turning point in Danish literature. Oehlenschläger’s first volume of poetry, Digte (1803; “Poems”), contained not only “Guldhornene” but also Sanct Hansaften-spil (“A Midsummer Night’s Play”); this latter work is a lyrical drama combining literary satire with poetic discourses on love and nature. His Poetiske skrifter (1805; “Poetic Writings”) contains two long cycles of lyric poems and Aladdin, a poetic drama on the writer’s own life, with the lamp of the story symbolizing intuitive poetic genius. Oehlenschläger was by now recognized as an important Romantic poet and an able practitioner of what Friedrich Schlegel termed Universalpoesie, a universal, historical, comparative approach to literature. In 1805 he received a government grant to study and travel in Germany and other countries, where he visited Goethe and the leaders of the Romantic movement.
