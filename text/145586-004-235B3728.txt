International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in full International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, formerly called World Conservation Union,  network of environmental organizations founded as the International Union for the Protection of Nature in October 1948 in Fontainebleau, France, to promote nature conservation and the ecologically sustainable use of natural resources. It changed its name to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in 1956 and was also known as the World Conservation Union (IUCN) from 1990 to 2008. The IUCN is the world’s oldest global environmental organization. Its headquarters are in Gland, Switz.
Through its member organizations, the IUCN supports and participates in environmental scientific research; promotes and helps implement national conservation legislation, policies, and practices; and operates or manages thousands of field projects worldwide. The IUCN’s activities are organized into several theme-based programs ranging from business and biodiversity to forest preservation to water and wetlands conservation. In addition, a smaller number of special initiatives draw upon the work of different programs to address specific issues, such as climate change, conservation, and poverty reduction. The volunteer work of more than 10,000 scientists and other experts is coordinated through special commissions on education and communication; environmental, economic, and social policy; environmental law; ecosystem management; species survival; and protected areas. All of the IUCN’s work is guided by a global program, which is adopted by member organizations every four years at the IUCN World Conservation Congress.
