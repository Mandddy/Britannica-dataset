Louis Blériot,  (born July 1, 1872, Cambrai, France—died Aug. 2, 1936, Paris) French airplane manufacturer and aviator who made the first flight of an airplane between continental Europe and Great Britain.
Blériot, a graduate of the École Centrale in Paris, met and married Alice Vedène while performing military service as a lieutenant of artillery. He used his modest fortune, amassed as a manufacturer of headlamps and other automotive accessories, to fund his earliest work in aeronautics. Following a series of experiments with a towed glider on the Seine River, he built and tested a variety of powered aircraft, ranging from box-kite biplanes to a tail-first (canard) monoplane. On July 25, 1909, he piloted his Blériot XI, a monoplane with a 25-horsepower engine, across the English Channel from Calais, France, to Dover, Eng. This feat won him a prize of £1,000 offered by the London Daily Mail and resulted in his emergence as one of the leading aircraft pilots and manufacturers of the era.
