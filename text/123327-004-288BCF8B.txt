Wuxi is one of the older cities in the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) delta area. It was originally known as a source of tin, but, by the time the county was founded in 202 bce under the Xi (Western) Han dynasty (206 bce–25 ce), the deposits had been exhausted, and the county was named Wuxi (“Without Tin”). From the end of the 3rd century the city was subordinated to the commandery (district under the control of a commander) of Biling (later Changzhou) and remained so except for a brief interval under the rule of the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty (1206–1368), when it was made an independent prefecture.
