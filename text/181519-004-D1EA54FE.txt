Elie Nadelman,  (born February 20, 1882, Warsaw, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died December 28, 1946, Bronx, New York, U.S.) Polish-born sculptor whose mannered curvilinear human figures greatly influenced early 20th-century American sculpture.
Nadelman left home at age 19 and, after briefly attending the Warsaw Art Academy, spent six months in Munich studying the city’s art collection. In 1904 he moved to Paris, where he worked independently but was influenced by the work of Auguste Rodin. Nadelman began an analysis of the relationship between sculptural volume and geometry in 1905, and his research culminated in the series of drawings published as Toward a Sculptural Unity (1914). His first one-man show in Paris in 1909 was a sensational success, as was his 1915 exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery. A number of his drawings and one sculpture were featured in the Armory Show in 1913. Nadelman’s abilities and early success attracted many important patrons, including art critic Leo Stein (one of writer Gertrude Stein’s older brothers) and businesswoman Helena Rubinstein.
