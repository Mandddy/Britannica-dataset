Doubs River,  river in eastern France. The river justifies its Latin name, Dubius, by its erratic course, rising near Mouthe in the Jura Mountains (in the Doubs département) at a height of 3,074 ft (937 m) and following a course 267 mi (430 km) long to flow into the Saône at Verdun-sur-le-Doubs, only 56 mi to the west. Where not canalized, the river is navigable for only a few miles above its mouth, where it flows northeastward toward the Rhine and doubles back on itself. In its upper course it is partly a torrent. It forms the Lac de Saint-Point before passing Pontarlier, and then is a waterfall (Saut du Doubs) at the Lac des Brenets, after which it flows for some 20 mi through gorges. After making a short incursion into Swiss territory, it has a hairpin bend at Saint-Ursanne before flowing westward through Saint-Hippolyte. Coursing northward, it bends sharply below Montbéliard, where it is joined by the Rhine-Rhône Canal. It flows southwestward to Besançon, capital of the Doubs département, looping round the centre of the city, to join the Saône after crossing Dole.
