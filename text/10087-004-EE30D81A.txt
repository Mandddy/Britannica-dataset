Dame Alicia Markova, original name Lilian Alicia Marks   (born December 1, 1910, London, England—died December 2, 2004, Bath) English ballerina noted for the ethereal lightness and poetic delicacy of her dancing.
Markova studied with Serafima Astafieva and Enrico Cecchetti and, after her debut at age 14 with Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, was soon dancing leading roles. In 1931 she joined the Vic-Wells Ballet (now the Royal Ballet) and was both its first prima ballerina (1933–35) and the first English dancer to dance the lead in Giselle and the full-length Swan Lake. Markova appeared as a ballerina of the Ballet Rambert, Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, and Ballet Theatre (now the American Ballet Theatre) and as a guest artist with the Metropolitan Opera. With Anton Dolin she founded the Markova-Dolin Ballet (1935) and Festival Ballet (1950; now the English National Ballet).
