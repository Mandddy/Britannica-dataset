Wilhelm Cuno, in full Wilhelm Carl Josef Cuno  (born July 2, 1876, Suhl, Germany—died January 3, 1933, Aumühle) German politician and business leader, general director of the Hamburg-American Line, and chancellor of the Weimar Republic during the Franco-Belgian invasion of the Ruhr (1923).
Appointed government assessor in the German imperial treasury department (1907), Cuno subsequently served as a government adviser charged with drafting and presenting bills to the Reichstag (national parliament). During the first years of World War I, he headed the department of grain management (until July 1916), then served in the food ministry and, finally again, in the treasury department as general adviser on the war economy. Later, during the Armistice and peace negotiations, he represented his government as an economic expert. Following the suicide of shipping magnate Albert Ballin, Cuno succeeded to the direction of the Hamburg-American Line (December 1918), the largest German shipping concern, and in this position frequently acted as unofficial spokesman for German foreign political interests.
