Sunbeam snake (genus Xenopeltis), any of two species of primitive, nonvenomous, burrowing snakes of family Xenopeltidae distributed geographically from Southeast Asia to Indonesia and the Philippines. Sunbeam snakes belong to a single genus (Xenopeltis) and are characterized by smooth, glossy, iridescent scales. The coloration of Xenopeltis is chocolate-brown or purplish black above and white below. It has a small, depressed head, cylindrical body, and an average length of 1 metre (3 feet)â€”although some individuals may grow to 1.3 metres (about 4 feet). Of the two species, X. unicolor is more widespread and better known, whereas X. hainanensis is limited to isolated pockets in southeastern China.
The sunbeam snake is nocturnal and burrows in the mud and decaying vegetation of rice paddies, marshes, and ditches. As a result, it is rarely seen except on cloudy or rainy days. It feeds on snakes, frogs, lizards, birds, and small mammals. It lays between 6 and 17 eggs, and hatchlings have a white collar around the neck. The sunbeam snake is entirely harmless to humans. When alarmed or irritated, it rapidly vibrates its tail, a characteristic of many snakes.
