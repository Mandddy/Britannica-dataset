Sir Isaac Pitman,  (born Jan. 4, 1813, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 12, 1897, Somerset) English educator and inventor of the shorthand system named for him.
After clerking in a textile mill, Pitman entered a training college for teachers (1831) and taught in elementary schools for 11 years before opening his own private school in Bath. Earlier he had taken up Samuel Taylor’s system of shorthand and become interested in developing shorthand based on sound. In 1837, at the suggestion of publisher Samuel Bagster, Pitman wrote Stenographic Sound Hand, which Bagster published at a low price for widest possible distribution. To encourage the adoption of his system, Pitman established a Phonetic Institute and a Phonetic Journal at Bath. He also printed standard works in shorthand, and his book Phonography (1840) went through many editions. He was an enthusiastic spelling reformer and adopted a phonetic system that he tried to bring into general use. In 1894 he was knighted.
