Carlo Janka,  (born October 15, 1986, Obersaxen, Switzerland) Swiss Alpine skier whose clean, efficient style and poised determination helped establish him as one of the sport’s top all-around competitors in the early 21st century.
Janka was born in a mountain village in southeastern Switzerland and began skiing at age two. As a teenager he also played football (soccer), but Austrian skier Hermann Maier’s multiple-medal-winning performance at the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, inspired him to focus exclusively on skiing. In December 2005, four years after his first Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS; International Ski Federation) race, Janka competed in his first World Cup event, and several months later he won a bronze medal in the giant slalom at the FIS junior world championships.
