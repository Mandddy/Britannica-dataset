Thomas A. Hendricks,  (born Sept. 7, 1819, near Zanesville, Ohio, U.S.—died  Nov. 25, 1885, Indianapolis, Ind.) long-time Democratic Party politician and 21st vice president of the United States (March 4–November 25, 1885) in the administration of President Grover Cleveland.
Hendricks was the son of John Hendricks, a farmer and a deputy surveyor of lands, and Jane Thomson. His grandfather served in the Pennsylvania legislature and his uncle was a governor and United States senator from Indiana. Thomas Hendricks was admitted to the bar in 1843 and began his public career as a representative (1848) in the Indiana legislature. He served as a member of the United States House of Representatives (1851–55), as commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office (1855–59), as U.S. senator (1863–69), and as governor of Indiana (1873–77). He was loyal to the Union but opposed many aspects of the Republican-dominated military effort in the American Civil War (1861–65) and the subsequent Reconstruction program for the South. He favoured leniency toward white supremacists in the South and opposed all legislation aimed at assisting freedmen, whether politically or economically.
