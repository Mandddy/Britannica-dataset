Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, vast natural area occupying the northeastern corner of the U.S. state of Alaska. It was established in 1960 as Arctic National Wildlife Range with an area of approximately 13,900 square miles (36,000 square km) and was expanded and renamed Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. After further territory was added to it in the 1980s, the refuge reached its present size of some 30,500 square miles (79,000 square km). It is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with headquarters in Fairbanks. One of the great pristine and largely undisturbed wilderness areas of North America, the refuge has been the subject of much controversy because of the potential hydrocarbon reserves within it.
The refuge, which lies wholly north of the Arctic Circle, is bordered to the north by the Beaufort Sea of the Arctic Ocean. Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge adjoins it to the south, and Canadaâ€™s Ivvavik and Vuntut national parks in Yukon territory abut it to the east. Its relief is dominated by the eastern portion of the rugged Brooks Range and its foothills, the generally east-west-trending ridgeline of the mountains forming a drainage divide. The refuge encompasses the tallest mountains in the range, with individual peaks reaching elevations of some 8,500 to 9,000 feet (2,590 to 2,740 metres). In the north the mountains descend to the low-lying plain of the North Slope along the sea. The Porcupine River, a major tributary of the Yukon River, cuts southwestward through the southeastern portion of the refuge and receives waters of the Coleen, Sheenjek, and other rivers flowing southward from the refuge. The Canning River, flowing northward into the Arctic Ocean, constitutes the northwestern boundary of the refuge.
