Woodland vole (Microtus pinetorum), a small mouselike rodent of the eastern United States that is well adapted to burrowing, as reflected by its slender, cylindrical body, strong feet, and large front claws. The very small eyes and ears are hidden in short, dense molelike fur; prominent whiskers are useful in navigating underground.
The woodland vole is one of the smallest members of its genus, weighing 14 to 37 grams (0.5 to 1.3 ounces). It measures 11 to 14 cm (4.3 to 5.5 inches) long, including the short tail (1 to 3 cm). The soft, silky fur is glossy brown or chestnut and is darker in the winter than in the summer. The underparts are dusky or silvery gray. The tail is brown above and lighter below.
