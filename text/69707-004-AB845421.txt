Splice, permanent joining of two ropes by interweaving their strands. In the short splice the strands of each rope are unlayed (untwisted), interwoven, and tucked into the lay (twist) of the other rope. For neatness the strands are usually trimmed down before the final tuck is made.
For making a permanent eye (closed circle) in a single rope, the eye splice, in which the free end is unlayed and interwoven at some point in the standing part of the rope, is employed, especially on sailing vessels.
