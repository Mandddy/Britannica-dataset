Constantine, also called (after 1981) Qacentina, Arabic Blad el-Hawa, Phoenician Cirta,  city, northeast Algeria. A natural fortress, the city occupies a rocky diamond-shaped plateau that is surrounded, except at the southwest, by a precipitous gorge through the eastern side of which flows the Rhumel River. The plateau is 2,130 feet (650 metres) above sea level and from 500 to 1,000 feet (150 to 300 metres) above the riverbed in the gorge. The cliffs of the gorge, at its narrowest, are 15 feet (4.5 metres) apart and at its greatest width are about 1,200 feet (365 metres) apart. The gorge is crossed at the northeast angle of the city by the el-Kantara Bridge, a modern 420-foot (130-metre) structure built on the site of earlier bridges. North and south of the city are, respectively, a suspension bridge and a viaduct.
Caves in the walls of the Rhumel Gorge give evidence of prehistoric settlement. By the 3rd century bce, as Cirta, or Kirtha (from the Phoenician word for “city”), the ancient Constantine was one of the most important towns of Numidia and the residence of the kings of the Massyli. Under Micipsa (2nd century bce) it reached the height of its prosperity and was able to furnish an army of 10,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. Cirta received a Roman settlement during the reign of Julius Caesar and later served as head of a confederation of four Roman colonies on the North African coast. In the war of the Roman emperor Maxentius against Alexander, the Numidian usurper, the city was razed, and on its restoration in 313 ce, it was renamed for its patron, Constantine I the Great. It remained uncaptured during the Vandal invasion of Africa but fell to the Arabs (7th century).
