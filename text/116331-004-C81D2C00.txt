River Tees, river in northeastern England, rising on Cross Fell in the northern Pennines and flowing 70 miles (110 km) east to the North Sea. It forms the boundary between the historic counties of Yorkshire and Durham. In its upper course the Tees flows in a typical Pennines dale (valley) where high moorlands flank an attenuated strip of farmland. At Caldron Snout and High Force there are waterfalls where the river crosses the hard dolerite outcrop of the Whin Sill. Below Middleton-in-Teesdale the valley broadens, and the river receives important right-bank tributaries—the Lune, the Balder, and the Greta—from subsidiary dales. Extensive tracts of the upper dales have been flooded to impound water for the needs of the industrial towns of Teesside, the urban area along the lower Tees. Below Barnard Castle the Tees meanders across a fertile clay plain to its estuary below Middlesbrough, where until the 19th century it entered the sea by shifting channels among extensive mudflats. The tortuous channel below Stockton has been straightened by artificial cuts, and large areas along the estuary shore have been reclaimed by dumping slag. These reclaimed riverfront areas house industrial sites and Teesport, one of the busiest ports in Britain. Stockton was the lowest bridging point on the Tees until the 20th century, but there are now bridges at Middlesbrough. Since 1825, when the Stockton and Darlington Railway was built (it was extended to Middlesbrough in 1830), Teesside has been the scene of large-scale industrial development and urbanization.
