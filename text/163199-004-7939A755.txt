Scrapie, also called rida or tremblante du mouton,  fatal neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. Scrapie has been endemic in British sheep, particularly the Suffolk breed, since the early 18th century. Since that time the disease has been detected in countries worldwide, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand, as well as in other breeds of sheep.
Scrapie is one of a group of diseases classified as spongiform encephalopathies, so named because the resultant deterioration of neurons causes a spongelike pattern to develop in the brain tissue. The agent responsible for those diseases is an abnormal prion, a deviant form of a benign protein normally found in the brain. In susceptible animals, the modified prion protein is thought to be able to convert the normal protein molecule into its own shape, thereby replicating itself within neurons, damaging them and causing the characteristic neurodegeneration.
