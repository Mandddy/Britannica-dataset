Vannevar Bush,  (born March 11, 1890, Everett, Mass., U.S.—died June 28, 1974, Belmont, Mass.) American electrical engineer and administrator who developed the Differential Analyzer and oversaw government mobilization of scientific research during World War II.
	The son of a Universalist minister, Bush received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics from Tufts College (Medford, Massachusetts) in 1913. Following a sequence of teaching and electronics jobs, he returned to graduate studies and, in 1916, received a doctorate in electrical engineering that was awarded jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), then located in Boston, and Harvard University, in nearby Cambridge. Bush returned to Tufts as an instructor in the fall of 1916 and soon became involved in antisubmarine research. A submarine-detection device that he invented during World War I was not adopted by the U.S. Navy, probably owing to Bush’s lack of access to government policy makers—an obstacle he would rectify in the next war.
