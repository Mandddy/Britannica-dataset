Carrie Jacobs Bond, née Carrie Minetta Jacobs   (born Aug. 11, 1862, Janesville, Wis., U.S.—died  Dec. 28, 1946, Hollywood, Calif.) composer-author of sentimental art songs that attained great popularity.
Bond as a child learned to play the piano. During her second marriage she began to write songs, and in December 1894 two of them, “Is My Dolly Dead?” and “Mother’s Cradle Song,” were published in Chicago. After her husband’s death in 1895 Bond moved to Chicago, where she ran a boarding house, painted china, and continued to write songs, most of which remained for many years in manuscript. By giving recitals and concerts in private homes and in public she supplemented her meagre income and at the same time gradually built up a ready audience for her songs. In 1901, with the help of a loan, she published Seven Songs as Unpretentious as the Wild Rose, which included two of her most popular songs, “I Love You Truly” and “Just a-Wearyin’ for You.” The success of that venture allowed her to open The Bond Shop, where she sold sheet music, designed by herself and printed by the Carrie Jacobs Bond and Son company.
