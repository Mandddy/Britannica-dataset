Olympic National Park, ecologically diverse area occupying much of the Olympic Peninsula in northwestern Washington, U.S. Originally established as a national monument in 1909 and redesignated a national park in 1938, it preserves the Olympic Mountains and their magnificent forests and wildlife. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1981. In 1988 virtually the entire park was declared a wilderness area. It covers 1,442 square miles (3,735 square km), much of which is surrounded by Olympic National Forest. Although European explorers had visited the peninsula in the late 18th century, it was not until 1885 that the first expedition into the mountainous interior was made. The parkâ€™s headquarters are at Port Angeles on the north coast of the peninsula.
The park consists of two units: the main area in the mountains and a narrow strip of Pacific shoreline more than 60 miles (95 km) long along the west coast of the peninsula. Active glaciers are found on the highest peak, Mount Olympus (7,965 feet [2,428 metres]), and on others. In all, there are some 250 glaciers in the park, although most are small and localized. The ocean shore section contains scenic beaches, islets, and points; three Indian reservations (of the Makah, Quileute, and Hoh tribes) lie within it.
