Richard T. Ely, in full Richard Theodore Ely  (born April 13, 1854, Ripley, New York, U.S.—died October 4, 1943, Old Lyme, Connecticut) American economist who was noted for his belief that government, aided by economists, could help solve social problems.
Ely was educated at Columbia University, graduating in philosophy in 1876, and at the University of Heidelberg, where he received his Ph.D. in 1879. As a professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University (1881–92), he advocated greater academic freedom and promoted a then-controversial account of the labour movement. This aroused enough indignation at Johns Hopkins to prompt his resignation. He then served as head of the department of economics at the University of Wisconsin (1892–1925).
