Clement XIV, original name Giovanni Vincenzo Antonio Ganganelli, Franciscan name Lorenzo  (born Oct. 31, 1705, near Rimini, Papal States â€”died Sept. 22, 1774, Rome) pope from 1769 to 1774.
Educated by the Jesuits at Rimini, he joined the Conventual Franciscans at Mondaino, taking the religious name of Lorenzo. After holding various academic offices, he was made cardinal in 1759 by Pope Clement XIII because he was supposed to be friendly toward the Society of Jesus, which was suffering suppression sponsored by a confederation led by Bourbon absolutists. He was elected pope on May 18, destined to face the ugly resolution of the Jesuit issue.
