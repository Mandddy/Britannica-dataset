Saddle bronc-riding, rodeo event in which the contestant attempts to ride a bucking horse (bronco) for eight seconds. The horse is equipped with a regulation saddle with stirrups and a six-foot braided rein attached to a halter and held with one hand. The rider must “mark out” (position the spurs over the horse’s shoulders) until after the first jump to give the horse the advantage. The rider’s spurs have no sharp edges, and the more the contestant spurs the horse, the higher the score. Disqualification occurs if the rider loses the stirrup or rein, is touched by the free hand or touches the horse or any part of the equipment with the free hand, or is bucked off before the whistle blows. The rider is scored by judges for skill and technique, and the horse is scored for difficulty. The two scores are combined, and the rider with the highest total wins.
