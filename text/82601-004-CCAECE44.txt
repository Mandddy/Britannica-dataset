Pontiac,  (born c. 1720, on the Maumee River [now in Ohio, U.S.]—died April 20, 1769, near the Mississippi River [at present-day Cahokia, Ill.]) Ottawa Indian chief who became a great intertribal leader when he organized a combined resistance—known as Pontiac’s War (1763–64)—to British power in the Great Lakes area.
Little is known of Pontiac’s early life, but by 1755 he had become a tribal chief. His commanding manner and talent for strategic planning enabled him to also become the leader of a loose confederacy among the Ottawa, the Potawatomi, and the Ojibwa. In 1760 he met Maj. Robert Rogers, a British colonial ranger on his way to occupy Michilimackinac (St. Ignace, Mich.) and other forts surrendered by the French during the French and Indian War of 1754–63. Pontiac agreed to let the British troops pass unmolested on condition that he be treated with respect.
