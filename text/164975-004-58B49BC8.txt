Christoph Martin Wieland,  (born September 5, 1733, Oberholzheim, near Biberach [Germany]—died January 20, 1813, Weimar, Saxe-Weimar) poet and man of letters of the German Rococo period whose work spans the major trends of his age, from rationalism and the Enlightenment to classicism and pre-Romanticism.
Wieland was the son of a Pietist parson, and his early writings from the 1750s were sanctimonious and strongly devotional. During the 1760s, however, he discovered another, more sensual aspect of his nature and moved toward a more worldly, rationalistic philosophy. Although some of Wieland’s work of this period includes erotic poetry, he began to find the balance between sensuality and rationalism that marked his mature writing. His Geschichte des Agathon, 2 vol. (1766–67; History of Agathon), which describes the process, is considered the first Bildungsroman, or novel of psychological development.
