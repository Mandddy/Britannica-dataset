Barbra Streisand, original name Barbara Joan Streisand  (born April 24, 1942, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American singer, composer, actress, director, and producer. She is considered by many to be the greatest popular singer of her generation. The first major female star to command roles as a Jewish actress, Streisand redefined female stardom in the 1960s and ’70s with her sensitive portrayal of ethnic urban characters. Her immense popularity matched only by her outspokenness, she became one of the most powerful women in show business, noted for her liberal politics and her philanthropy.
Initially aspiring to be a dramatic actress, Streisand joined a summer theatre group in Malden Bridge, New York, and began studying acting while still in high school. After graduation she moved to Manhattan, where her first break came in 1960 when she sang at a small local nightclub and won an amateur talent contest (and dropped the second a from her first name). Following singing engagements in Greenwich Village cabarets, she landed a small comic role as Miss Marmelstein in the Broadway musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale (1962) and stole the show. An immediate sensation, she made frequent television appearances, notably on The Judy Garland Show, and, beginning in 1963, released a series of best-selling record albums that featured vibrant and original interpretations of popular songs. Her first solo album, The Barbra Streisand Album, won Grammy Awards for album of the year and best female vocal performance—the first two of many.
