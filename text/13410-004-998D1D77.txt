Apollonius The Athenian,  (flourished  1st century bc) sculptor known only by his signatures on the marble “Belvedere Torso,” now in the Vatican, and the bronze “Boxer,” now in the Museo Nazionale Romano of Rome. At one time these sculptures were thought to be 1st-century originals. Now it is believed they are fine 1st-century copies of original 2nd-century works; although the inscriptions are datable to the 1st century, the style of the sculptures is similar to that of the great altar at Pergamum, a key monument of the 2nd century. Thus, Apollonius appears to have been one of the most talented copyists of his time.
