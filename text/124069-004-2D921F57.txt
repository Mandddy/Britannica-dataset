Pick-up-sticks, also called jackstraws, or spillikins ,  game of skill, played by both children and adults, with thin wooden sticks or with straws or matches. In the early 18th century sticks were made of ivory or bone; later they were made of wood or plastic.
To begin the game, 20 to 50 sticks are bunched in one hand and set vertically on a table or other smooth, flat surface then released suddenly so that they fall in a jumble. Each player in turn attempts to remove a single stick without disturbing any other. If he succeeds he may try again, but if another stick moves the player loses his turn.
