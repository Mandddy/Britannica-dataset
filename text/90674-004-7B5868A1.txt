Richard Boleslavsky, Boleslavsky also spelled Bolesławski, Boleslavski, or Boleslawski, original name Bolesław Ryszard Śrzednicki  (born February 4, 1889, Dębowa Góra, Poland, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died January 17, 1937, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) motion-picture and stage director who introduced the Stanislavsky method of acting to the United States. He directed such popular American films of the 1930s as Rasputin and the Empress (1932), Les Misérables (1935), and Theodora Goes Wild (1936).
Boleslavsky first acted onstage in Odessa in 1904, and in 1906 he entered the school of the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT) under director Konstantin Stanislavsky. In the Stanislavsky method of acting, playing a character onstage is as much a matter of delving into a character’s psychology and emotions as it is saying lines in a script. In 1909 Boleslavsky played the leading role of Belyayev in Stanislavsky’s famous production of Ivan Turgenev’s Mesyats v derevne (A Month in the Country) and was a teacher at the MAT’s First Studio, which trained actors in the Stanislavsky method.
