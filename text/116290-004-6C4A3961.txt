Lemuel Shaw,  (born January 9, 1781, Barnstable, Massachusetts, U.S.—died March 30, 1861, Boston) chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (1830–60), who left an indelible mark on the law of that state and significantly contributed to the structure of American law.
Shaw was educated at Harvard, studied law privately, was admitted to the bar in 1804 in New Hampshire, and entered private practice. Extremely successful, he became prominent in the public life of the state. He drafted the first municipal charter for Boston in 1822 virtually without precedents to guide him and in 1830 accepted appointment as chief justice of Massachusetts. His decisions on that bench were formative in the development of both Massachusetts and national jurisprudence. He is particularly remembered for two opinions. In Commonwealth v. Hunt (1842), his ruling in favour of a striking labour union provided the first major precedent for removing labour unions from the province of the law of conspiracy. In Roberts v. City of Boston (1849), his ruling upholding the city’s segregated schools was later reflected in the U.S. Supreme Court’s “separate but equal” doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), but its more immediate effect was to stimulate the passage in Massachusetts of the only 19th-century American desegregation law.
