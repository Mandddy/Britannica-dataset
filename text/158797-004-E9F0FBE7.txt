Lake, any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not well established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison with lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water. For a list of the major natural lakes of the world, see below.
This article treats lake basins and sedimentation; the physical and chemical properties of lake waters; lake currents, waves, and tides; and the hydrologic balance of lakes. For information on related systems, see river. The place of lakes within the hydrologic cycle is further dealt with in hydrosphere, as are certain aspects of lake sedimentation and water chemistry. See inland water ecosystem for information on lacustrine life-forms.
