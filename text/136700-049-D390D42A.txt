Nike missile, any of a series of U.S. surface-to-air missiles designed from the 1940s through the 1960s for defense against attack by high-flying jet bombers or ballistic-missile reentry vehicles.
The first missile in the series was Nike Ajax, a two-stage, liquid-fueled missile 21 feet (6.4 metres) long built by the Douglas Aircraft Company. Guided by a radar system designed by Bell Laboratories, it could intercept aircraft flying as high as 70,000 feet (21,000 metres) within a range of 30 miles (50 km) at more than twice the speed of sound. The missile carried three high-explosive warheads that would be detonated by the guidance system at the predicted interception point. Beginning in 1953, Ajax missiles were installed in some 200 fixed launcher sites in cities and military sites throughout the United States. They were also distributed among U.S. allies in Europe and Asia.
