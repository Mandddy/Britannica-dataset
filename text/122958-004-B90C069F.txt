Roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), one of the largest and most formidable African antelopes (family Bovidae) and a member of the tribe Hippotragini, the so-called horse antelopes.
The roan is a powerfully built animal with long, sturdy limbs and a thick neck that looks thicker because of an upstanding mane and a beard. The head is long and narrow with a wide gape, framed by long, tasseled ears. Named for its colour, the roan is reddish gray to reddish brown, with a striking black-and-white facial mask. The sexes look much alike, standing 126–150 cm (50–59 inches), but males are heavier (280 kg [620 pounds] versus 260 kg [570 pounds] for females) and have thicker, sickle-shaped horns 55–99 cm (22–39 inches) long, 10–20 percent longer than those of females.
