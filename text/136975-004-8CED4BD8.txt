Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), astronomical research institution headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., on the campus of Harvard University. The CfA was created in 1973 by reorganizing the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory under one director.
The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is organized into seven scientific divisions—atomic and molecular physics, high-energy astrophysics, optical and infrared astronomy, planetary sciences, radio and geoastronomy, solar and stellar physics, and theoretical astrophysics—and an education department. Some of its activities and staff are managed by the Smithsonian Institution, some by Harvard-administered interests, and some in combination. The CfA’s planetary sciences division is home to the International Astronomical Union’s Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which is responsible for disseminating information worldwide on transient astronomical phenomena such as new comets, novas, and supernovas, and its Minor Planet Center, which collects, checks, and disseminates observations and orbital data on asteroids and comets, including near-Earth objects. Major research emphases at the CfA include space-based X-ray astronomy, ground-based gamma-ray astronomy, the application of computers to problems of theoretical astrophysics, and the development of very long baseline interferometry techniques for radio astronomy.
