Ian Paisley, in full Ian Richard Kyle Paisley  (born April 6, 1926, Armagh, County Armagh, Northern Ireland—died September 12, 2014, Belfast, Northern Ireland) militant Protestant leader in the factional conflict that divided Northern Ireland from the 1960s, who was first minister of Northern Ireland from May 2007 to June 2008. He also served as a member of the British Parliament (1970–2010) and the European Parliament (1979–2004).
The son of a maverick Baptist minister, Paisley was ordained by his father in 1946. He cofounded and became moderator of his own church, the Free Presbyterian Church, in 1951. In 1969 he founded the Martyrs Memorial Free Presbyterian Church in Belfast, Northern Ireland. From 1961 to 1991 membership in his churches increased 10-fold, though the 1991 census indicated that they attracted less than 1 percent of Northern Ireland’s population. Paisley’s strength lay in his ability to combine the language of biblical certainty with that of politics at a time when many Protestants were uncertain about their constitutional identity and fearful of their physical security. His ideological message combined militant anti-Catholicism with militant unionism.
