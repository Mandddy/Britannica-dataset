Gamma-ray astronomy, study of astronomical objects and phenomena that emit gamma rays. Gamma-ray telescopes are designed to observe high-energy astrophysical systems, including stellar coronas, white dwarf stars, neutron stars, black holes, supernova remnants, clusters of galaxies, and diffuse gamma-ray background radiation found along the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy. Because Earthâ€™s atmosphere blocks most gamma rays, observations are generally conducted by high-altitude balloons or spacecraft. In the 1960s defense satellites designed to detect X-rays and gamma rays from clandestine nuclear testing serendipitously discovered enigmatic gamma-ray bursts coming from deep space. In the 1970s Earth-orbiting observatories found a number of gamma-ray point sources, including an exceptionally strong one dubbed Geminga that was later identified as a nearby pulsar. The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991, mapped thousands of celestial gamma-ray sources; it also showed that the mysterious bursts are distributed across the sky, implying that their sources are at the distant reaches of the universe rather than in the Milky Way. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, launched in 2008, discovered pulsars that emitted only gamma rays.
