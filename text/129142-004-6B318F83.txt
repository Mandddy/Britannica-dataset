Chauncey Jerome,  (born June 10, 1793, Canaan, Conn., U.S.—died April 20, 1868, New Haven, Conn.) American inventor and clock maker whose products enjoyed widespread popularity in the mid-19th century.
Learning the carpenter’s trade early in life, Jerome was employed as a case maker in 1816 by Eli Terry, a clock maker at Plymouth, Conn. Later Jerome started his own business, selling clocks with his cases fitted with movements supplied by other makers. The bronze looking-glass clock case he designed in 1827 became especially popular; he then formed a company that soon became the leader in clock production, with the main plant located at Bristol, Conn.
