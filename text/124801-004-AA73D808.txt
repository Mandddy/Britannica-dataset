Medal of Honor, byname Congressional Medal Of Honor,  the foremost U.S. military decoration, instituted by Congress in 1861 for the navy and in 1862 for the army, at first awarded only to enlisted men, with officers being permitted to receive the award later. It is given for “conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty.” The army medal has always been awarded solely for valour in combat, but the navy medal could be, and was, awarded for noncombat purposes such as lifesaving, although since 1942 it has been awarded only for combat.
The medal is suspended from a blue ribbon with a centre pad containing 13 white stars. The army medal is formed of a bronze star with the head of Minerva in the centre, suspended from a bar bearing the word “Valor” on which sits an eagle with outspread wings. The reverse of the bar has “The Congress to . . .” and the name of the recipient. The naval design has a star suspended from an anchor with the centre device showing Minerva repulsing Discord. The air force design has a centre device displaying the head of the Statue of Liberty; the star is suspended from a thunderbolt with a bar marked “Valor.”
