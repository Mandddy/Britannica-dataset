Narwhal (Monodon monoceros), also spelled narwal or narwhale,  a small, toothed whale found along coasts and in rivers throughout the Arctic. Males possess a long, straight tusk that projects forward from above the mouth.
Narwhals lack a dorsal fin, and in adults the flippers are turned upward at the tips. Their mottled gray bodies are darker above than below, and they usually attain a length of 3.5 to 5 metres (11.5 to 16.4 feet), with males being larger than females. Adult males weigh about 1,600 kg (3,500 pounds); females weigh about 1,000 kg.
