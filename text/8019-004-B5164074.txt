William Cavendish, 4th duke of Devonshire,  (born 1720—died October 3, 1764, Spa, Liège, Austrian Netherlands [now in Belgium]) prime minister of Great Britain from November 1756 to May 1757, at the start of the Seven Years’ War.
Eldest son of William Cavendish, the 3rd Duke (1698–1755), he was elected to the House of Commons in 1741 and 1747, and in 1751 he moved to the House of Lords, as Lord Cavendish of Hardwick, in his father’s barony. After becoming lord lieutenant and governor-general of Ireland (1754), he succeeded to the dukedom (1755); and the following year he agreed to become nominal prime minister. William Pitt had refused to serve in the ministry of the Duke of Newcastle, and the great Whig families balked at Pitt himself becoming prime minister. Thus, Devonshire was summoned to the post, while Pitt became the ministry’s real authority as secretary of state to manage the war. When Pitt reconciled with Newcastle the following year, Devonshire, without having made much of a mark on events, resigned and became lord chamberlain of the household, a post he held until 1762.
