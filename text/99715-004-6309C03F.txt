Ader Éole, monoplane designed, built, and first tested by the French aeronautical pioneer Clément Ader in 1890. For a table of pioneer aircraft, see history of flight.
Ader began work on his first powered aircraft in 1882. Named Éole in honour of the Greek god of the winds (Aeolus), the machine was finally completed and ready for trial in 1890. Éole was a tailless monoplane featuring deeply curved batlike wings. The most impressive feature of the machine was a 20-horsepower steam engine that weighed only 51 kg (112 pounds) and that drove a four-bladed tractor propeller.
