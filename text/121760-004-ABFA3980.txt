A land-grant institution, Auburn University was chartered in 1856 and opened in 1859 as East Alabama Male College. The school was closed two years later, however, at the outset of the American Civil War and reopened in 1866. The Methodist church, which had supported it before the war, transferred control of the college to the state of Alabama in 1872. The school’s name was then changed to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. Women were first admitted in 1892. The name was changed to Alabama Polytechnic Institute in 1899 and to Auburn University in 1960. The Montgomery campus was created in 1967, and instruction began there in 1969. Architect William Spratling was an Auburn graduate.
