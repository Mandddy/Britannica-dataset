Bananaquit (Coereba flaveola), bird of the West Indies (except Cuba) and southern Mexico to Argentina. It is sometimes placed with honeycreepers in the family Emberizidae (order Passeriformes); however, because of disagreements over its taxonomy, many authorities assign the bananaquit to its own family (Coerebidae) or consider it incertae sedis, meaning “of uncertain position.” About 11 cm (4.5 inches) long, the bananaquit is blackish above and yellow below, with, generally, white stripes near the eyes and white patches on the wings. It uses its sharp curved bill to probe flowers for nectar; sometimes it eats insects and fruit. It uses banana-leaf fibre in making its domed nest.
