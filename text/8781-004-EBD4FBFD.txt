John Wallis,  (born Nov. 23, 1616, Ashford, Kent, Eng.—died  Oct. 28, 1703, Oxford, Oxfordshire) English mathematician who contributed substantially to the origins of the calculus and was the most influential English mathematician before Isaac Newton.
Wallis learned Latin, Greek, Hebrew, logic, and arithmetic during his early school years. In 1632 he entered the University of Cambridge, where he received B.A. and M.A. degrees in 1637 and 1640, respectively. He was ordained a priest in 1640 and shortly afterward exhibited his skill in mathematics by deciphering a number of cryptic messages from Royalist partisans that had fallen into the hands of the Parliamentarians. In 1645, the year of his marriage, Wallis moved to London, where in 1647 his serious interest in mathematics began when he read William Oughtred’s Clavis Mathematicae (“The Keys to Mathematics”).
