Croquet, also called Lawn Croquet,  popular outdoor game, played on a lawn or court, with long-handled mallets with which the players hit balls through a series of wickets, or hoops.
The game evolved from paille-maille (French: “pall-mall”), which was played in France at least as early as the 13th century and introduced into England in the 16th century. The game that became known as croquet combined the basic elements of paille-maille—running a mallet-driven ball through a hoop or hoops to touch a peg as a goal—into a somewhat more complicated sport involving a series of six or more hoops laid out in a pattern, which had to be run in a specified order.
