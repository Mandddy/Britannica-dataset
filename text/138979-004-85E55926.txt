Morava River, German March,  tributary of the Danube rising in eastern Czech Republic; in its lower course, the river divides the Czech Republic from Slovakia and then Slovakia from Austria. It gives its name to Moravia, an ancient region that covers most of the river’s drainage basin, which is 15,000 square miles (38,900 square km) in area. Its western tributaries drain from the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands; the eastern tributaries, of which the Bečva is the most significant, drain from the westernmost ranges of the Carpathians. The Morava River rises on the southern slope of Králický Sněžník in the Nízký and Hrubý Jeseník mountains and follows a 227-mile (365-kilometre) course south to enter the Danube River just above Bratislava, Slovakia. The river valley has been important historically as one of Europe’s natural corridors. A low pass in the north between the Bečva and Oder rivers—the Moravian Gate—connects the Danube countries with the Silesian Plain and the Central Plain of Poland.
