Madeleine,  delicate, scallop-shaped French tea cake often served with fruit or sherbet. In its preparation, flour, eggs, and sugar are beaten with a large proportion of butter, incorporating as much air as possible; then grated lemon rind and vanilla extract, and sometimes rum, are added. After baking in the customary 12-shell tin, the pastry is served plain or dusted with confectioner’s sugar.
The origins of the madeleine are disputed, but it was brought to its acme, and thence to broad fame, in the 18th century by the pastry chefs of Commercy. The French author Marcel Proust immortalized the madeleine in his novel Swann’s Way (1913), in which a taste of the cake is said to have evoked the surge of memory and nostalgia subsequently chronicled in his novel cycle Remembrance of Things Past (1913–27).
