Indochina, also called (until 1950) French Indochina, French Indochine Fran√ßaise,  the three states of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia formerly associated with France, first within its empire and later within the French Union. The term Indochina refers to the intermingling of Indian and Chinese influences in the culture of the region.
 After gradually establishing suzerainty over Indochina between 1858 and 1893, the French created the first Indochinese Union to govern it. Except in Cochinchina (French: Cochinchine), the southernmost portion of Vietnam, the original Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian royal houses continued under a federal-type central government that had exclusive authority in foreign affairs, finance, defense, customs, and public works and was headed by a French governor-general responsible to the French minister for trade. In Cochinchina the administration was under a prefect and a French bureaucracy.
