20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, American dramatic film, released in 1954, that was the acclaimed adaptation of Jules Verneâ€™s classic nautical adventure of the same name.
Kirk Douglas, Peter Lorre, and Paul Lukas played the hapless trio of seamen who, while attempting to investigate a string of mysterious whaling ship disappearances, are both shipwrecked and saved by Captain Nemo (played by James Mason), an ingenious pacifist who, ironically, plans to use violence to bring an end to war. They realize that Nemo is behind the sinkings, with the help of his futuristic submarine the Nautilus, which goes undetected by masquerading as a sea serpent. Pursued by warships, Nemo destroys his island home in order to prevent his secrets about nuclear power from being discovered. The three seamen escape to safety as the fatally injured Nemo takes the Nautilus for a final dive.
