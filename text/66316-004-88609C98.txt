Kay Boyle,  (born February 19, 1902, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.—died December 27, 1992, Mill Valley, California) American writer and political activist noted throughout her career as a keen and scrupulous student of the interior lives of characters in desperate situations.
Boyle grew up mainly in Europe, where she was educated. Financial difficulties at the onset of World War I took the family back to the United States, to Cincinnati, Ohio. In June 1923 she married and soon moved with her husband to France. Shortly after settling there she began publishing poems and short stories regularly in such influential expatriate periodicals as Broom and transition and in Harriet Monroe’s Poetry; and in 1929 she published her first book, a collection entitled Wedding Day and Other Stories.
