Francis Cottington, Baron Cottington,  (born c. 1579, Pitcombe, Somerset?, Eng.—died  June 19, 1652, Valladolid, Spain) English lord treasurer and ambassador who was leader of the pro-Spanish, pro-Roman Catholic faction in King Charles I’s court during the decade preceding the English Civil Wars (1642–51).
Cottington was ambassador to Spain in 1616–17 under King James I. In 1629 James’s successor, Charles I, made him chancellor of the exchequer and again sent him to Spain as ambassador. In 1631 Cottington signed a secret treaty with Spain. As a reward he was made a baron. His prominence in Charles’s council and his Roman Catholic and Spanish sympathies earned him the enmity of Puritans in Parliament. He opposed their attack on Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, unsuccessfully urging the king not to yield to demands for the earl’s execution. Cottington was ousted from his chancellorship in January 1642.
