Johns Hopkins University, privately controlled institution of higher learning in Baltimore, Md., U.S. Based on the German university model, which emphasized specialized training and research, it opened primarily as a graduate school for men in 1876 with an endowment from Johns Hopkins, a Baltimore merchant. It also provided undergraduate instruction for men. The university, now coeducational, consists of eight academic divisions and the Applied Physics Laboratory, the latter located in Laurel, Md. The Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, the G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering, and the School of Continuing Studies (for part-time students) are located at the Homewood campus in northern Baltimore.
Johns Hopkins Hospital, a separate institution, was opened in 1889, but—because of a lack of funds—the university was unable to initiate a medical school at that time. In 1893 a group of women interested in obtaining opportunities in medical education raised an endowment of $500,000 that was given with the understanding that women would be admitted to Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (now located in eastern Baltimore) on the same terms as men. It is operated in close relationship with Johns Hopkins Hospital. In 1918 the School of Hygiene and Public Health was opened, and the School of Nursing began in 1984.
