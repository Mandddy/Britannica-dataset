Francis Thompson,  (born Dec. 18, 1859, Preston, Lancashire, Eng.—died  Nov. 13, 1907, London) English poet of the 1890s, whose most famous poem, “The Hound of Heaven,” describes the pursuit of the human soul by God.
Thompson was educated in the Roman Catholic faith at Ushaw College, a seminary in the north of England. He studied medicine at Manchester, but not conscientiously, and began to take opium; he then went to London, where from 1885 to 1888 he lived in destitution. In 1888 the publication of two of his poems in Wilfrid Meynell’s periodical, Merry England, aroused the admiration of Robert Browning. Meynell and his wife, Alice, befriended Thompson, induced him to enter a hospital, nursed him through convalescence, and in 1893 arranged publication of a collection, Poems. Thompson is chiefly associated with rhapsodic accounts of religious experience written in a diction much influenced by 17th-century Catholic verse, though he could also produce elegant, direct, and moving short poems, such as “At Lord’s,” a remarkable lyric about cricket.
