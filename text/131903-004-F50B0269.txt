Raynaud syndrome, condition occurring primarily in young women that is characterized by spasms in the arteries to the fingers that cause the fingertips to become first pale and then cyanotic—bluish—upon exposure to cold or in response to emotional stress. Upon cessation of the stimulus, redness develops and there is a tingling or burning sensation lasting several minutes. The toes, ears, and nose also may be affected. The condition can occur in association with atherosclerosis and thromboangiitis obliterans. Treatment of Raynaud syndrome includes drugs that dilate the blood vessels and protection of the fingers from cold temperatures. See also acrocyanosis.
