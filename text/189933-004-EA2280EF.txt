Detroit Institute of Arts, art museum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., noted for its collection of American paintings from the 19th century and its Dutch, Flemish, and Italian paintings from the Renaissance through the Baroque period. It is also known for a large collection of arts of antiquity and of the Islamic world, based on works acquired by pharmaceutical magnate Frederick Stearns. The Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and ancient Persian holdings have been augmented by artifacts from western Europe, Mesopotamia, and ancient Arabia. The museum also houses traditional Asian, African, Oceanian, and Native American works and contemporary art from around the world.
The museum was founded in 1885 by a group of Detroit citizens. It was given to the city in 1919 and moved into its present Neoclassical-style structure in 1927. It was enlarged by additions completed in 1966 and 1971. The museumâ€™s central courtyard is decorated with a series of 27 murals by the Mexican painter Diego Rivera that depict the automobile industry. In 2001 the museum created a new department, the General Motors Center for African American Art, and in 2010 it opened a gallery dedicated to Islamic art.
