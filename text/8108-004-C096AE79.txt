Irish setter, breed of sporting dog renowned for its elegant build and its bright, mahogany-coloured coat; it was developed in early 18th-century Ireland to locate birds for the hunter. Probably of English and Gordon setter, spaniel, and pointer ancestry, it stands about 25 to 27 inches (63.5 to 69 cm) and weighs 60 to 70 pounds (27 to 32 kg). Its shiny coat is straight and flat, with feathering on the ears, legs, chest, belly, and tail; originally red and white, solid mahogany or chestnut brown is now preferred. The Irish red and white setter, resembling the 19th-century ancestors, has been developed as a distinct breed. The Irish setter is noted for being good-tempered, intelligent, and swift in the field.
