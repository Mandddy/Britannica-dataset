Robert Gilbert Vansittart, Baron Vansittart, in full Robert Gilbert Vansittart, Baron Vansittart of Denham  (born June 25, 1881, Farnham, Surrey, England—died February 14, 1957, Denham, Buckinghamshire) British diplomat, author, and extreme Germanophobe.
Vansittart was educated at Eton and then trained for diplomatic service. He was first secretary at the Paris Peace Conference (1919–20) and principal private secretary to Lord Curzon (1920–24) and to successive Prime Ministers Stanley Baldwin (1928–29) and Ramsay MacDonald (1929–30). As permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office (1930–38), he warned the British government of the growing military power of Germany and insisted that Great Britain should rearm. Vansittart espoused a Germanophobic doctrine—which became known as Vansittartism—that held that the conduct of German war leaders from the time of the Franco-German War (1870–71) had had the wholehearted support of the German people and that Germany had to be permanently demilitarized and isolated politically to ensure against future aggression. In terms of diplomacy, his efforts at establishing a united front against Germany included the much-maligned Hoare-Laval Pact, a secret plan which sought to forge a robust alliance between Britain, France, and Italy by providing broad support for the last’s objectives in the Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–36).
