Electric furnace,  heating chamber with electricity as the heat source for achieving very high temperatures to melt and alloy metals and refractories. The electricity has no electrochemical effect on the metal but simply heats it.
Modern electric furnaces generally are either arc furnaces or induction furnaces. A third type, the resistance furnace, is still used in the production of silicon carbide and electrolytic aluminum; in this type, the furnace charge (i.e., the material to be heated) serves as the resistance element. In one type of resistance furnace, the heat-producing current is introduced by electrodes buried in the metal. Heat also may be produced by resistance elements lining the interior of the furnace.
