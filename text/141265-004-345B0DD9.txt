Pinecone fish, any member of either of two genera of fishes (Cleidopodus and Monocentris) belonging to the family Monocentridae (order Beryciformes), found in deepwater marine habitats of the Indo-Pacific region. The common name comes from the characteristically oval body covered with enlarged, spiny platelike scales, which thus resembles a pinecone. Luminescent organs occur on the lower jaw.
The Japanese pinecone fish (M. japonicus) normally reaches a length of 13 cm (5 inches) and travels in schools near the ocean bottom. Although small, it is commercially important as a food fish and as a saltwater aquarium fish.
