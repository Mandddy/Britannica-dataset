Ahura Mazdā, (
        Avestan: “Wise Lord”) also spelled Ormizd or Ormazd,  supreme god in ancient Iranian religion, especially Zoroastrianism, the religious system of the Iranian prophet Zarathustra (c. 6th century bce; Greek name Zoroaster). Ahura Mazdā was worshipped by the Persian king Darius I (reigned 522–486 bce) and his successors as the greatest of all gods and protector of the just king.
According to Zarathustra, Ahura Mazdā created the universe and the cosmic order that he maintains. He created the twin spirits Spenta Mainyu and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman)—the former beneficent, choosing truth, light, and life; and the latter destructive, choosing deceit, darkness, and death. The struggle of the spirits against each other makes up the history of the world and is reflected in the choice between good and evil that humanity constantly faces.
