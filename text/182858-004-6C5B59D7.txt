Darth Vader, film character, lead villain of the popular American science fiction franchise Star Wars.
First seen in the movie Star Wars (1977; later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope), the towering, black-clad Darth Vader is a menacing villain. His head is covered by a mechanical helmet, and the sound of his breathing is an eerie, mechanical hiss. Armed with a deadly light sabre, telekinetic abilities, and keen intelligence, Vader leads the army of the Empire in a ruthless campaign against the heroic Rebel Alliance. In an intriguing twist offered in The Empire Strikes Back (1980; Star Wars: Episode V—The Empire Strikes Back), Vader is revealed to be the father of the young rebel Luke Skywalker, and at the climax of the next film, Return of the Jedi (1983; Star Wars: Episode VI—Return of the Jedi), Vader turns against the Empire to save his son’s life, sacrificing his own in the process.
