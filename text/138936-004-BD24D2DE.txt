Sonia Gandhi, original name Edvige Antonia Albina Maino  (born December 9, 1946, Lusiana, Veneto region, Italy) Italian-born Indian politician who was president of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party; 1998– ) and chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (2004– ), the ruling coalition.
While studying English at a language school in Cambridge, England, Sonia met Rajiv Gandhi, a mechanical engineering student at the University of Cambridge and son of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The couple married in 1968 and moved into the prime minister’s official residence, although Rajiv eschewed politics for a career as a commercial airline pilot. However, in 1980 his brother, Sanjay, died, and Rajiv subsequently entered the political arena. When Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984, Rajiv was named prime minister. Though Sonia campaigned for Rajiv, she chose to remain in the background, studying art restoration and working to preserve India’s artistic treasures.
