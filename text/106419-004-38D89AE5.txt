Justin Timberlake, in full Justin Randall Timberlake  (born January 31, 1981, Memphis, Tennessee, U.S.) American singer and actor who achieved fame as a member of the hugely successful “boy band” **NSYNC before establishing a career as a solo performer.
Along with Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and future **NSYNC member J.C. Chasez, Timberlake launched his performing career in the late 1980s on the Disney Channel’s The New Mickey Mouse Club. In 1996 he and Chasez were recruited for the male pop vocal quintet **NSYNC. The group’s self-titled debut, released in 1998, did well commercially after a slow start, and their second effort, No Strings Attached (2000), became one of the fastest-selling albums in history, selling more than 14 million copies and featuring a string of hits, including the chart-topping “It’s Gonna Be Me.” Timberlake began his solo recording career in 2001 after the release of **NSYNC’s third album.
