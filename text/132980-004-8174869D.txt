George Julius Poulett Scrope,  (born March 10, 1797, London—died Jan. 19, 1876, Fairlawn, Surrey, Eng.) English geologist and political economist whose volcanic studies helped depose the Neptunist theory that all the world’s rocks were formed by sedimentation from the oceans. Originally surnamed Thomson, he assumed the surname Scrope in 1821 on his marriage to the daughter of William Scrope, the last of the old earls of Wiltshire.
As an undergraduate he visited Naples in 1816–17, where his interest in volcanoes was stimulated by the activity of Vesuvius. In 1821 he examined the extinct volcanoes of the Auvergne, in central France, and collected material for his On the Geology and Extinct Volcanoes of Central France (1827).
