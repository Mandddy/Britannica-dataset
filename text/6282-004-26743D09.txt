Bareback bronc-riding, rodeo event in which a cowboy or cowgirl attempts to ride a bucking horse (bronco) for eight seconds. The horse is equipped with a leather and rawhide handhold “rigging” cinched on like a saddle. The rider grasps the rigging with only one hand, and the holding arm absorbs most of the horse’s bucking power. At the beginning of the event, the rider is required to “mark out”; that is, the contestant’s spurs must be touching a point high on the horse’s shoulders before the animal’s front feet first hit the ground after it leaves the chute; this gives the horse the initial advantage. Disqualification occurs if the rider touches the horse or any part of the rider’s own body or equipment with the free hand, fails to “mark out,” or is bucked off before the whistle. Horse and rider are scored separately for their performance, and the rider with the highest total wins.
