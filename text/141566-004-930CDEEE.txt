Mudflow,  flow of water that contains large amounts of suspended particles and silt. It has a higher density and viscosity than a streamflow and can deposit only the coarsest part of its load; this causes irreversible sediment entrainment. Its high viscosity will not allow it to flow as far as a water flow.
Mudflows occur on steep slopes where vegetation is not sufficient to prevent rapid erosion but can occur on gentle slopes if other conditions are met. Other factors are heavy precipitation in short periods and an easily erodible source material. Mudflows can be generated in any climatic regime but are most common in arid and semiarid areas. They may rush down a mountainside at speeds as great as 100 km (60 miles) per hour and can cause great damage to life and property. Boulders as large as houses have been moved by mudflows.
