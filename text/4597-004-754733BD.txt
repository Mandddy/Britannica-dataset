Lawrence Taylor, in full Lawrence Julius Taylor, byname L.T.  (born Feb. 4, 1959, Williamsburg, Va., U.S.) American collegiate and professional gridiron football player, considered one of the best linebackers in the history of the game. As a member of the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL), he won Super Bowl championships following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.
Taylor, who did not play organized football until the 11th grade, attended the University of North Carolina, where he initially played defensive lineman before being moved to outside linebacker. With a rare combination of size and speed, Taylor, 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 metres) tall and weighing 240 pounds (109 kg), excelled as a linebacker, and he was named All-American in 1980.
