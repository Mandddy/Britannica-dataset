Andrés Manuel López Obrador,  (born November 13, 1953, Villa de Tepetitán, Tabasco, Mexico) populist Mexican politician who served as head of the Federal District government (2000–05) and ran, unsuccessfully, for president of Mexico in 2006.
López Obrador was born into a provincial middle-class family. From 1972 to 1976 he studied political science and public administration at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He began his political career in Mexico’s long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), eventually becoming Tabasco state party president in 1983. He left the party, however, and backed the dissident presidential candidacy of Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas in 1988. López Obrador’s own 1988 opposition candidacy for Tabasco’s governorship ended in defeat, but he later became state president of the party founded on the basis of Cárdenas’s electoral coalition, the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD).
