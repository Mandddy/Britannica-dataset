Spherulite, spherical body generally occurring in glassy rocks, especially silica-rich rhyolites. Spherulites frequently have a radiating structure that results from an intergrowth of quartz and orthoclase. These spherical bodies are thought to have formed as a consequence of rapid mineral growth after nucleation, possibly on an accumulation of volatiles.
Spherulites that manifest concentric shells are called orbicules and are found in some granites and syenites. The shells have different mineralogies and in orbicular granite and granodiorite the bulk composition differs from that of the host rock. Orbicules are rare in gabbros. Suggested origins include devitrification of glass around scattered nuclei, inclusions of contaminating basic rock, or a rhythmic crystallization around foreign fragments.
