Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, original name (until 1773) Carl Ditters   (born Nov. 2, 1739, Vienna, Austria—died  Oct. 24, 1799, Rothlhotta Castle, Neuhof, Bohemia [now Nové Dvory, Czech Republic]) violinist and composer of instrumental music and of light operas that established the form of the singspiel (a comic opera in the German language).
A brilliant child violinist, Ditters played regularly at the age of 12 in the orchestra of Prince von Sachsen-Hildburghausen and later in the orchestra of the Vienna opera. He became friendly with the composer Christoph Gluck and accompanied him in 1761 to Bologna, Italy. There Ditters gained considerable celebrity with his violin playing. In 1765 he became director of the orchestra of the bishop of Grosswardein and wrote for it his first opera, Amore in musica (“Love in Music”). His first oratorio, Isacco (“Isaac”), was also written during this time.
