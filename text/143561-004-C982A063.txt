Vesper bat (family Vespertilionidae), also called evening bat,  large family of bats numbering more than 400 species. They are found worldwide in both tropical and temperate regions, their habitats ranging from tropical forest to desert.
Vesper bats have small eyes and well-developed tails. Most species have long wings, and some have very large ears. The fur is generally gray, brown, or blackish, but it may be red, as in the red bat (Lasiurus borealis), grizzled, as in particoloured bats (Vespertilio), or marked with white, as in spotted bats (Euderma). The lesser bamboo bat, one of the smallest of bats, is about 4 cm (1.5 inches) in head and body length; it weighs about 2 grams (0.07 ounce) and has a wingspan of 15 cm (6 inches). Other species range up to 10 cm (4 inches) in head and body length and 50 grams (1.8 ounces) in weight.
