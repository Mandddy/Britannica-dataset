Norwich terrier, short-legged terrier breed developed about 1880 in England, where it soon became a fad with Cambridge students. It was later used by various American hunt clubs and has also drawn notice as a rabbit hunter. It is stockily built, with a broad head and erect ears, and it has a dense, wiry, weather-resistant coat, usually reddish brown. A small characteristically rugged and loyal dog, the Norwich terrier ideally stands no more than 10 inches (25 cm) and weighs 10 to 14 pounds (4.5 to 6.5 kg).
