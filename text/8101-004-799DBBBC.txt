Chesapeake Bay retriever, breed of sporting dog, developed in the United States in the 19th century to retrieve downed fowl from icy coastal waters. Its water-repellent, short, thick coat tends to be wavy on the back, shoulders, and loins, and it occurs in colours described as brown, sedge, or dead grass. Its eyes are yellow or amber. It stands 21 to 26 inches (53 to 66 cm) and weighs 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg). The breed was first registered by the American Kennel Club in 1878. It is a powerful, assertive, independent, and protective dog and is more reserved than some of the easygoing retriever breeds.
