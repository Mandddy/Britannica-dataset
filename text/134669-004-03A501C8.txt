Al Smith, in full Alfred Emanuel Smith   (born December 30, 1873, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 4, 1944, New York City) U.S. politician, four-time Democratic governor of New York and the first Roman Catholic to run for the U.S. presidency (1928).
When his father died, young Smith interrupted his schooling and went to work for seven years at the Fulton fish market in New York City to help support his family. His political career was launched in 1895, when Tammany Hall—the New York City Democratic political organization—appointed him an investigator in the office of the city commissioner of jurors. He then served in the state assembly (1903–15), where his lively intelligence, dedication to the voters of his district, and genial manner won him the powerful office of speaker by 1913. Initially a routine politician, he gained a wider point of view on social issues as a member of a commission investigating factory conditions (1911) and as a delegate to the state constitutional revision committee (1915). Tammany Hall made him sheriff of New York County (1915), and in 1917 he was elected president of the Board of Aldermen of Greater New York.
