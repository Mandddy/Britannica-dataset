Hugo Junkers,  (born Feb. 3, 1859, Rheydt, Prussia [Germany]—died  Feb. 3, 1935, Gauting, near Munich, Ger.) German aircraft designer and early proponent of the monoplane and all-metal construction of aircraft.
Junkers patented a flying-wing design in 1910, the same year in which he established an aircraft factory at Dessau. His J-1 Blechesel (“Sheet Metal Donkey”) monoplane was the first successful all-metal airplane (1915), and his F-13 was the first all-metal transport (1919). Many Junkers aircraft had a corrugated sheet-metal skin, which was copied by several American builders, including the Ford Motor Company. The Junkers works also built “Jumo” aircraft engines, designed one of the first turbojet engines during World War II, and played an important part in German airpower during the war, supplying the Luftwaffe with the Ju 52, a trimotor monoplane used as a troop transport and glider tug; the Ju 87 dive bomber (Sturzkampfflugzeug, shortened to “Stuka”); and the Ju 88, a twin-engine all-purpose bomber.
