Akebono, original name Chadwick Haheo Rowan, also called (from 1996) Akebono Tarō  (born May 8, 1969, Waimanalo, Hawaii, U.S.) American-born Japanese sumo wrestler, who, in January 1993, became the first non-Japanese person to be elevated to yokozuna (grand champion) status, the highest rank in professional sumo.
Rowan grew up on the island of Oahu in Hawaii and entered college there on a basketball scholarship. In less than a year he had dropped out of school because he had arguments with his coach and found his classes boring. Setting aside a natural interest in language and culture, he took his father’s advice and in 1988 agreed to meet fellow Hawaiian Jesse Kuhaulua, who had become a sumo stablemaster in Japan. Before retiring from sumo competition in 1984, Kuhaulua (under the name Takamiyama) had set a series of virtually unbeatable records as an ozeki (junior champion), the second-highest sumo rank. He persuaded Rowan to join his stable.
