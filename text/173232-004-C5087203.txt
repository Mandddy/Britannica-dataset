Manoel de Oliveira, in full Manoel Cândido Pinto de Oliveira  (born December 11, 1908, Porto, Portugal—died April 2, 2015, Porto) Portuguese filmmaker, known for richly meditative and often self-reflexive films that were frequently inspired by literary and theatrical works. Although his career began in the silent film era, he did not attain international recognition until the late 20th century, and his most prolific period was in his senescence.
Oliveira, whose father was a prominent industrialist, grew up in Porto before attending a Jesuit boarding school in Galicia, Spain. As a young man, Oliveira engaged in athletic pursuits and excelled at auto racing, although he was also interested in the performing arts. After enrolling in an acting school in his hometown in 1928, his attention turned to filmmaking. Influenced by German Expressionist cinema and by Soviet directors’ pioneering use of montage, Oliveira produced Douro, faina fluvial (1931; “Douro, Working River”), a short silent documentary that offered a sober portrait of working life in Porto. He continued to make documentary shorts throughout the 1930s and also acted in A canção de Lisboa (1933; “The Song of Lisbon”), Portugal’s first sound film.
