World Food Programme (WFP), organization established in 1961 by the United Nations (UN) to help alleviate world hunger. Its headquarters are in Rome, Italy.
The WFP’s programs are aimed at helping the more than 15 percent of the world’s population that is hungry. Its Food-For-Life program aids victims of both natural and human-made disasters by collecting and transporting food to crisis areas. Contributions of commodities, cash, and services (primarily shipping) help beneficiaries to maintain balanced diets. Its Food-for-Growth programs are directed at vulnerable groups—including children, pregnant and nursing women, and the elderly—and its Food-For-Work program encourages self-reliance by providing food in return for labour.
