Iztaccíhuatl, also spelled Ixtaccihuatl,  dormant volcano situated on the México-Puebla state line in central Mexico. It lies 10 miles (16 km) north of its twin, Popocatépetl, and 40 miles (65 km) south-southeast of Mexico City. Iztaccíhuatl (from the Nahuatl for “white woman”) has three summits, the highest one reaching 17,159 feet (5,230 m), but no crater. As seen from the federal capital, the snow-covered peaks resemble the head, breast, and feet of a recumbent woman—hence the popular designation of sleeping woman. Iztaccíhuatl last erupted in 1868.
