Ferdinand Freiligrath,  (born June 17, 1810, Detmold, Westphalia [Germany]—died  March 18, 1876, Cannstatt, near Stuttgart, Ger.) one of the outstanding German political poets of the 19th century, whose verse gave poetic expression to radical sentiments.
After working as an accountant in a bank in Amsterdam (1831–39), Freiligrath abandoned commerce for literature with the success of his first poems, the Romantic Gedichte (1838; “Poems”). Influenced by Victor Hugo, these early poems are characterized by vividly imaginative and evocative exotic scenes and technical virtuosity; they won him a pension from the Prussian king Frederick William IV.
