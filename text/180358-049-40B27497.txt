Mullet, any of the abundant, commercially valuable schooling fishes of the family Mugilidae (order Perciformes). Mullets number fewer than 100 species and are found throughout tropical and temperate regions.
They generally inhabit salt water or brackish water and frequent shallow, inshore areas, commonly grubbing about in the sand or mud for microscopic plants, small animals, and other food. They are silvery fishes 30–90 cm (1–3 feet) long, with large scales; relatively stocky, cigar-shaped bodies; forked tails; and two distinct dorsal fins, the first containing four stiff spines. Many have strong, gizzardlike stomachs and long intestines capable of handling a largely vegetarian diet.
