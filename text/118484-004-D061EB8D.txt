Schwarze Elster River, right- (east-) bank tributary of the Elbe River, rising in the Lusatian Mountains, about 4 miles (7 km) northwest of Bischofswerda, Ger. Flowing north, it leaves the mountains near Kamenz, where it turns northeast to enter the Upper Lusatia region. Between Hoyerswerda, where it turns west, and Senftenberg, the river passes through a lignite (brown coal) mining district. West of Senftenberg the river flows through forests into Lower Lusatia, a rich agricultural plain; there it receives several tributaries. At Elsterwerda it turns northwest and completes its 112-mile- (180-kilometre-) long course 9 miles (14 km) southeast of Wittenberg, where it joins the Elbe. The Schwarze Elster drains a basin of 2,123 square miles (5,498 square km).
