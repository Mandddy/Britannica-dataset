Butyl rubber (IIR),  also called isobutylene-isoprene rubber,  a synthetic rubber produced by copolymerizing isobutylene with small amounts of isoprene. Valued for its chemical inertness, impermeability to gases, and weatherability, butyl rubber is employed in the inner linings of automobile tires and in other specialty applications.
Both isobutylene (C[CH3]2=CH2) and isoprene (CH2=C[CH3]-CH=CH2) are usually obtained by the thermal cracking of natural gas or of the lighter fractions of crude oil. At normal temperature and pressure isobutylene is a gas and isoprene is a volatile liquid. For processing into IIR, isobutylene, refrigerated to very low temperatures (approximately −100 °C [−150 °F]), is diluted with methyl chloride. Low concentrations (1.5 to 4.5 percent) of isoprene are added in the presence of aluminum chloride, which initiates the reaction in which the two compounds copolymerize (i.e., their single-unit molecules link together to form giant, multiple-unit molecules). The polymer repeating units have the following structures:
