Navy SEAL, SEAL in full Sea, Air, and Land,  in the U.S. Navy, a member of a special operations force trained to engage in direct raids or assaults on enemy targets, conduct reconnaissance missions to report on enemy activity (especially prior to beach landings), and take part in action against terrorist groups.
The SEALs trace their heritage to various elite units in World War II, particularly to naval combat demolition units (NCDUs) and underwater demolition teams (UDTs) whose “frogmen” were trained to destroy obstacles on enemy-held beaches prior to amphibious landings in Europe and the Pacific. Other special units of that war were scouts and raiders, who were assigned to reconnoitre coastal areas and guide landing craft to the shore, and “operational swimmers” of the secretive Office of Strategic Services, who are said to have pioneered modern underwater combat. During the Korean War, UDTs undertook their usual reconnaissance and mine-clearing work, but they also extended their missions beyond the beach by disrupting enemy transportation lines inland.
