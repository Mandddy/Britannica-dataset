Peggy Lee, original name Norma Deloris Egstrom  (born May 26, 1920, Jamestown, N.D., U.S.—died Jan. 21, 2002, Los Angeles, Calif.) American popular singer and songwriter, known for her alluring, delicately husky voice and reserved style.
Lee lost her mother when she was very young, and the rest of her childhood was difficult. As a teenager, she began singing professionally on a Fargo, N.D., radio station, where a program director christened her with her stage name. After graduating from high school, she sang with various bands in Minnesota, Florida, and California. During a Palm Springs nightclub engagement in 1941, when she sang quietly, Lee discovered the sound that brought her success, captivating the previously noisy crowd. Her big break came later that year when Benny Goodman heard her sing in Chicago and hired her as vocalist for his band. Her developing style could be heard on such well-received recordings with Goodman as “I Got It Bad (And That Ain’t Good)” and “Winter Weather.” Her development was rapid, and with “Why Don’t You Do Right?” (1943) Lee had her first major hit.
