Mountain Zebra National Park,  national park in Eastern Cape province, South Africa. It is situated in the semiarid Great Karoo region, west of Cradock. It has an area of 25 square miles (65 square km) and was founded in 1937 primarily to protect the diminishing mountain zebra, which differ from common (or Burchellâ€™s) zebra in having a short, stocky build and a distinctive stripe pattern on the rump. The park also supports black wildebeests, elands, and several other species of antelopes. Vegetation consists chiefly of shrubs, grasses, and a few acacia trees. Headquarters are at Cradock.
