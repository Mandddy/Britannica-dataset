Selous Game Reserve, huge game reserve, southeastern Tanzania. It is named after Frederick Selous, a naturalist, explorer, and soldier. It covers an area of more than 17,000 square miles (44,000 square km) and bestrides a complex of rivers including the Kilombero, Ruaha, and Rufiji. Its vegetation is woodland, with patches of dense hardwood forest and some of the finest virgin bush left in Africa. The reserve, established in 1922, holds one of the largest remaining concentrations of big-tusked elephants and large-maned lions, as well as such other mammals as buffalo, leopard, rhinoceros, zebra, and various antelopes. This virtually inaccessible reserve was opened to visitors in 1963 when hunting tracks were constructed. The reserve was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.
