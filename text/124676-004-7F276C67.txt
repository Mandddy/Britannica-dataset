Subrahmanya C. Bharati, also spelled Subramania C. Bharati  (born Dec. 11, 1882, Ettaiyapuram, Madras Presidency, India—died  Sept. 12, 1921, Madras) outstanding Indian writer of the nationalist period who is regarded as the father of the modern Tamil style.
The son of a learned Brahman, Bharati became a Tamil scholar at an early age. He received little formal education, however, and in 1904 moved to Madras (now Chennai). There he translated English into Tamil for several magazines and later joined the Tamil daily newspaper Swadesamitran. This exposure to political affairs led to his involvement in the extremist wing of the Indian National Congress party, and, as a result, he was forced to flee to Pondicherry (now Puducherry), a French colony, where he lived in exile from 1910 to 1919. During this time Bharati’s nationalistic poems and essays were popular successes. Upon his return to India in 1919 he was briefly imprisoned and later rejoined Swadesamitran. He was killed by a temple elephant in Madras.
