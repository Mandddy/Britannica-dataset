Joseph Beuys,  (born May 12, 1921, Krefeld, Ger.—died  Jan. 23, 1986, Düsseldorf) German avant-garde sculptor and performance artist whose works, characterized by unorthodox materials and ritualistic activity, stirred much controversy.
Beuys was educated in Rindern, Ger., and served in the German air force throughout World War II. In 1943 his plane crashed in the frozen Crimea. Those who found him tried to restore his body heat by wrapping him in fat and an insulating layer of felt; these substances would later become recurring motifs in his sculptural works. From 1947 to 1951 he studied art in Düsseldorf, and in 1961 he was appointed professor of sculpture at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf. Beuys was also involved in German politics.
