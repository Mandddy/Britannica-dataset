Aristide Maillol,  (born December 8, 1861, Banyuls-sur-Mer, Franceâ€”died September 27, 1944, near Banyuls-sur-Mer) French sculptor, painter, and printmaker whose monumental statues of female nudes display a concern for mass and rigorous formal analysis.
Maillol began his artistic career as a painter and tapestry designer; his early work reflected his great admiration for the Nabis, a group of artists in France whose work was composed typically of decorative patterns. Maillol was almost 40 years old when an eye disease forced him to give up tapestry weaving, and so he turned his attention to sculpture.
