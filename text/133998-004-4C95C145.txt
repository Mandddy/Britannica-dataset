Sign, in marketing and advertising, device placed on or before a premises to identify its occupant and the nature of the business done there or, placed at a distance, to advertise a business or its products.
The ancient Egyptians and Greeks used signs for advertising purposes, as did the Romans, who also, in effect, created signboards by whitewashing convenient sections of walls for suitable inscriptions. Early shop signs were developed when tradesmen, dealing with a largely illiterate public, devised certain easily recognizable emblems to represent their trades. Many examples of Roman signs are preserved, including the famous sign of a bush that was mounted before a tavern to indicate the availability of wine. Some signs, like the Roman bush, the three golden balls of the pawnbroker, and the red and white stripes of the barber—representing blood and bandages, since barbers once also did bloodletting—early became identified with particular trades. Other fields were never so identified, and the signs developed for them reflected coats of arms, if the proprietor could plausibly claim one, or simply the most compelling graphic device that a signpainter could contrive.
