John McCain to serve as his vice presidential running mate in the 2008 presidential election. She was the first woman to appear on a Republican presidential ticket.

Palin was less than a year old when her family relocated to Skagway, Alaska. She completed a degree in communications at the University of Idaho (1987) before returning to Alaska to work as a sports reporter at an Anchorage television station. Palin entered politics in 1992 with a seat on the Wasilla city council, and four years later she launched a successful campaign to become that city’s mayor. During her six years in office as mayor, she ushered through a series of infrastructure improvements funded by a sales tax increase, and the city’s operating budget soared.
