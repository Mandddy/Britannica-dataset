Antimatter, substance composed of subatomic particles that have the mass, electric charge, and magnetic moment of the electrons, protons, and neutrons of ordinary matter but for which the electric charge and magnetic moment are opposite in sign. The antimatter particles corresponding to electrons, protons, and neutrons are called positrons (e+), antiprotons (p), and antineutrons (n); collectively they are referred to as antiparticles. The electrical properties of antimatter being opposite to those of ordinary matter, the positron has a positive charge and the antiproton a negative charge; the antineutron, though electrically neutral, has a magnetic moment opposite in sign to that of the neutron. Matter and antimatter cannot coexist at close range for more than a small fraction of a second because they collide with and annihilate each other, releasing large quantities of energy in the form of gamma rays or elementary particles.
The concept of antimatter first arose in theoretical analysis of the duality between positive and negative charge. The work of P.A.M. Dirac on the energy states of the electron implied the existence of a particle identical in every respect but one—that is, with positive instead of negative charge. Such a particle, called the positron, is not to be found in ordinary stable matter. However, it was discovered in 1932 among particles produced in the interactions of cosmic rays in matter and thus provided experimental confirmation of Dirac’s theory.
