Jimmie Noone,  (born April 23, 1895, near New Orleans, La., U.S.—died  April 19, 1944, Los Angeles, Calif.) black American jazz clarinetist noted for his lyricism and refinement of technique. He is one of the three principal clarinetists of early jazz, the other two being Johnny Dodds and Sidney Bechet.
Noone studied with Bechet and began his career with New Orleans bands, including important ones led by Freddie Keppard, Kid Ory, and Buddy Petit. In 1918 he settled in Chicago, where he played with Doc Cooke’s band (1920–26, 1927) and studied with classical clarinetist Franz Schoepp. He recorded with King Oliver’s Creole Band in 1923. By the late 1920s he was also leading his own group at the Apex Club (1926–28) and other Chicago venues. Despite some touring, he remained largely in Chicago throughout the 1930s and led a big band in 1939. About 1943 he resettled in California, where he led a band and also played on recordings and radio programs with Ory.
