Flavio Biondo, Latin Flavius Blondus   (born 1392, Forlì, Romagna [Italy]—died  June 4, 1463, Rome) humanist historian of the Renaissance and author of the first history of Italy that developed a chronological scheme providing an embryonic notion of the Middle Ages.
Biondo was well educated and trained as a notary before he moved in 1433 to Rome, where he was appointed apostolic secretary the following year. After serving on diplomatic missions to Venice and to the condottiere Francesco Sforza, he wrote De Roma instaurata, 3 vol. (1444–46; “Rome Restored”), a reconstruction of ancient Roman topography. In 1459 he wrote De Roma triumphante, a discussion of pagan Rome as a model for new reform in administrative and military institutions. The book was extremely influential, serving both to provide a new conception of the papacy as a modern continuation of the Roman Empire and to awaken Roman patriotism and respect for antiquity.
