Álvaro de Bazán, Marqués de Santa Cruz,  (born Dec. 12, 1526, Granada, Spain—died  Feb. 9, 1588, Lisbon, Port.) the foremost Spanish naval commander of his day. He was prominent in many successful naval engagements in a century that saw Spain rise to the zenith of its power and was the first proponent and planner of the Spanish Armada, the fleet that was to attempt the invasion of England shortly after his death.
The son of a Spanish naval commander, he entered the navy at an early age and fought against the French, the Turks, and the Moors in the Mediterranean. He steadily advanced in rank and was created the Marqués de Santa Cruz in 1569. In the Battle of Lepanto against the Turks (1571), Santa Cruz, as commander of the reserve fleet, displayed excellent seamanship and played an important role in the crushing of the Turkish fleet.
