Doberman pinscher, breed of working dog developed in Apolda, Ger., by Louis Dobermann, a night watchman and keeper of a dog pound, in the late 1800s. The Doberman pinscher is a sleek, agile, and powerful dog standing 24 to 28 inches (61 to 71 cm) and weighing 60 to 88 pounds (27 to 40 kg). It has a short, smooth coat, black, blue, fawn, or red in colour, with rust markings on the head, throat, chest, base of the tail, and feet. The breed has a reputation for fearlessness, alertness, loyalty, and intelligence. It has been used in police and military work, as a watchdog, and as a guide dog for the blind.
