Acrobatics,  (Greek: “to walk on tip-toe,” or “to climb up”), the specialized and ancient art of jumping, tumbling, and balancing, often later with the use of such apparatus as poles, one-wheel cycles, balls, barrels, tightropes, trampolines, and flying trapezes.
In 1859 the invention of the flying trapeze by J. Léotard, as well as Charles Blondin’s crossing of Niagara Falls on a tightrope, rekindled public interest in aerial gymnasts and acrobats. Although the trapeze had never been seen before, ropedancing can be traced back to ancient Greece.
