Tim McGraw, original name Samuel Timothy Smith  (born May 1, 1967, Delhi, Louisiana, U.S.) American musician, whose melodic, heartfelt songs and sandy Southern twang made him one of the most popular country music singers in the 1990s and early 21st century.
Raised by a single mother, McGraw was 11 years old before he discovered that his father was famed professional baseball pitcher Tug McGraw. After dropping out of college in 1989 to move to Nashville, he found work as a club performer and signed a record contract with Curb Records in 1990. McGraw’s 1993 debut recording was unsuccessful, but his follow-up, Not a Moment Too Soon, became the biggest-selling country album of 1994 (and the sixth best-selling album of the year in any genre). His celebrity spread with the release of All I Want (1995) and with his high-profile marriage in 1996 to country star Faith Hill. By 2000 he was well-established enough to release a 15-song greatest hits package, and 2001 found McGraw and Hill accepting a Grammy Award for their duet “Let’s Make Love.”
