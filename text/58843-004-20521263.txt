Ürümqi, Chinese (Pinyin) Wulumuqi or (Wade-Giles romanization) Wu-lu-mu-ch’i, Uighur Ürümchi, also spelled Urumqi or Urumchi,  city and capital of the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang, northwestern China. The city (whose name in Uighur means “fine pasture”) is situated in a fertile belt of oases along the northern slope of the eastern Tien (Tian) Shan range. Ürümqi commands the northern end of a gap leading from the Tarim Basin into the Junggar (Dzungarian) Basin. Pop. (2006 est.) city, 1,504,252; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 2,151,000.
The area first came under full Chinese control in the 7th and 8th centuries, when the Chinese established the protectorate general of Beiting some 80 miles (130 km) to the east. A county named Luntai had earlier been founded at Ürümqi in 640, which became an important centre for caravans traveling into the Ili River valley from the main route across Turkistan. After the withdrawal of the Tang dynasty (618–907) from the area in the 750s, Ürümqi came under the control of the Uighurs. It again came under Chinese rule during the campaigns of the Qing dynasty against the Dzungars in the 18th century. In 1760 military colonies were established in the surrounding oases, and in 1763 a Chinese city called Dihua was founded there.
