John Cage, in full John Milton Cage, Jr.  (born September 5, 1912, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died August 12, 1992, New York, New York) American avant-garde composer whose inventive compositions and unorthodox ideas profoundly influenced mid-20th-century music.
The son of an inventor, Cage briefly attended Pomona College and then traveled in Europe for a time. Returning to the United States in 1931, he studied music with Richard Buhlig, Arnold Schoenberg, Adolph Weiss, and Henry Cowell. While teaching in Seattle (1938–40), Cage organized percussion ensembles to perform his compositions. He also experimented with works for dance, and his subsequent collaborations with the choreographer and dancer Merce Cunningham sparked a long creative and romantic partnership.
