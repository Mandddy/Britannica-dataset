Richard Brautigan, in full Richard Gary Brautigan   (born Jan. 30, 1935, Tacoma, Wash., U.S.—found dead Oct. 25, 1984, Bolinas, Calif.) American novelist and poet known for ironic, often surreal works that conceal dark humour and social criticism.
Brautigan grew up in the Pacific Northwest and had an unhappy childhood. His parents separated before he was born, and his family, which relocated often, suffered abject poverty for a time. As a teenager he was committed to the Oregon State Hospital, where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; he spent two months there and received electroshock therapy. Shortly after leaving the hospital, he moved to San Francisco; there he was befriended by writers associated with the San Francisco Renaissance and the Beat Generation, including the poets Robert Duncan, Michael McClure, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Brautigan wrote poetry, experimenting with metre and image because, he claimed, he wanted to perfect writing sentences so he could write novels. In 1957 he published “The Return of the Rivers” a single, 26-line poem, as a chapbook. Subsequent volumes of poetry included The Galilee Hitch-Hiker (1958), Lay the Marble Tea: Twenty-four Poems (1959), The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster (1968), and Loading Mercury with a Pitchfork (1976).
