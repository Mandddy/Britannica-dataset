Pilcher Hawk, monoplane glider designed, built, and first flown by the English aviator Percy Sinclair Pilcher in 1896.
Pilcher completed work on four gliders between 1895 and 1899: Bat (1895), Beetle (1895), Gull (1896), and Hawk (1896). Each was a monoplane with bird-form wings and a stabilizing tail, reminiscent of the gliders produced by Prussian aviator Otto Lilienthal. Unlike Lilienthal, however, Pilcher was usually towed into the air by horses operating through a pulley.
