Saguenay River, French Rivière Saguenay,  river in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region, south central Quebec province, Canada. It drains Lac-Saint-Jean into the St. Lawrence River at Tadoussac, about 120 miles (190 km) northeast of Quebec city. Flowing east-southeast, the Saguenay, in the first third of its 105-mile (170-km) length, descends about 300 feet (90 metres) in a turbulent stream. Below Saguenay, at the head of navigation, the valley is virtually a fjord through which the river, without shoals or obstructions (average depth, about 800 feet [245 metres]), continues between precipitous cliffs, which culminate in the majestic capes Trinity and Eternity, more than 1,600 feet (490 metres) high. The upper river and its tributaries are major sources of hydroelectric power; Shipshaw, Chute à Caron, and Îsle-Maligne dams have a combined capacity of more than 1,500,000 kilowatts, most of which powers huge aluminum smelters and pulp and paper mills at Saguenay. Ha Ha Bay, about 20 miles (32 km) downstream from central Saguenay (Chicoutimi district), is a fjordlike arm of the Saguenay into which the Ha Ha River and Rivière à Mars empty.
