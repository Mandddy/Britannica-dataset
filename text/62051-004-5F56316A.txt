Olympia Brown,  (born Jan. 5, 1835, Prairie Ronde, Mich., U.S.—died Oct. 23, 1926, Baltimore, Md.) minister and social reformer, an active campaigner for woman suffrage and one of the first American women whose ordination was sanctioned by a full denomination.
Brown was refused admission to the University of Michigan because of her sex and instead attended Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, for a year and then Antioch College (now Antioch University) in Yellow Springs, Ohio, graduating in 1860. Three years later, under the inspiration of Antoinette Blackwell, she graduated from the theological school of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, and in June 1863 was ordained in the ministry of the Universalist church, becoming the first American woman to be ordained by full denominational authority. (Blackwell’s ordination in a Congregational church rested on the autonomous authority of a single congregation.) Brown served churches in Weymouth, Massachusetts (1864–70), and Bridgeport, Connecticut (1870–76).
