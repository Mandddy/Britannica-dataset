Elementary algebra, branch of mathematics that deals with the general properties of numbers and the relations between them. Algebra is fundamental not only to all further mathematics and statistics but to the natural sciences, computer science, economics, and business. Along with writing, it is a cornerstone of modern scientific and technological civilization. Earlier civilizations—Babylonian, Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Islamic—all contributed in important ways to the development of elementary algebra. It was left for Renaissance Europe, though, to develop an efficient system for representing all real numbers and a symbolism for representing unknowns, relations between them, and operations.
Elementary algebra is concerned with the following topics:Real and complex numbers, constants, and variables—collectively known as algebraic quantities.Rules of operation for such quantities.Geometric representations of such quantities.Formation of expressions involving algebraic quantities.Rules for manipulating such expressions.Formation of sentences, also called equations, involving algebraic expressions.Solution of equations and systems of equations.
