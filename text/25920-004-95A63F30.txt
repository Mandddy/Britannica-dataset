Adelaide Ristori,  (born Jan. 29, 1822, Cividale del Friuli, Austria-Hungary [now in Italy]—died  Oct. 8, 1906, Turin, Italy) internationally renowned Italian tragedienne.
The daughter of strolling players, Ristori began as a child actress and at the age of 14 was cast in the title role of Silvio Pellico’s Francesca da Rimini. She joined the Royal Sardinian Company as ingenue and advanced in two years to the position of leading lady. At 18 she attempted the title role in Friedrich von Schiller’s Maria Stuart. In 1855 she went to Paris, where the devotees of Mlle Rachel, the reigning tragedienne of the Comédie-Française, found that the foreign guest lacked the pure classicism for which the French star was famous. But there were other critics, Alexander Dumas père among them, who adored the passionate outbursts and spontaneity of the Italian temperament that broke through the general stateliness of Ristori’s grand style. When she played the comic part of Mirandolina in Carlo Goldoni’s Locandiera, the approval of the Parisians was unanimous. She finally triumphed as a tragedienne in Vittorio Alfieri’s Mirra. She later appeared in Germany, Vienna, London, Warsaw, and Madrid. Her repertory included Jean-Baptiste Racine’s Phèdre, Ernest Legouvé’s Médée, and William Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth. She toured the United States for the first time in 1866, and her successes encouraged her return in 1867, 1875, and 1884. In 1874 the actress embarked upon a professional tour around the world. She retired from the stage in 1885 and two years later published her Ricordi e studi artistici (“Memoirs and Artistic Studies”), a volume containing analyses of her outstanding tragic roles.
