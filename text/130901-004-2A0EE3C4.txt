Public house, byname pub ,  an establishment providing alcoholic beverages to be consumed on the premises. The traditional pub is an establishment found primarily in Britain and regions of British influence. English common law early imposed social responsibilities for the well-being of travelers upon the inns and taverns, declaring them to be public houses which must receive all travelers in reasonable condition who were willing to pay the price for food, drink, and lodging.
In Tudor England (1485–1603), selected innkeepers were required by a royal act to maintain stables; in addition, some innkeepers acted as unofficial postmasters and kept stables for the royal post. In the mid-1600s some public houses even issued unofficial coins, which the innkeepers guaranteed to redeem in the realm’s currency. By the 1800s many of these establishments were divided internally to segregate the various classes of customers. Public houses—inns or taverns—were considered socially superior to alehouses, beerhouses, and ginshops.
