Ellen DeGeneres, in full Ellen Lee DeGeneres  (born January 26, 1958, Metairie, Louisiana, U.S.) American comedian and television host known for her quirky observational humour.
DeGeneres briefly attended the University of New Orleans, where she majored in communications. Dissatisfied with university life, she left to work in a law firm and later held a string of jobs, including waitress, bartender, house painter, and oyster shucker. After putting together a comedy routine for a group of friends, DeGeneres was asked to perform in local coffeehouses in the late 1970s. She was soon traveling through the United States on the comedy club circuit, earning applause with her quirky, naive stories that were punctuated with her loose-limbed gestures. Her style was compared to those of Mary Tyler Moore and Lucille Ball. DeGeneres’s act also caught the attention of Showtime, and the cable network named her Funniest Person of the Year in 1982. Her career hit a high note in 1986 after she was invited to perform on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Following her humorous rendition of “Phone Call to God,” Carson motioned DeGeneres to sit and chat—the first time a female comedian had been given that honour.
