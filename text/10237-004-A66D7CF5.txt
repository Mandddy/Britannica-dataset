Jacques Lipchitz, original name Chaim Jacob Lipchitz   (born August 10 [August 22, New Style], 1891, Druskininkai, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died May 26, 1973, Capri, Italy) Russian-born French sculptor whose style was based on the principles of Cubism; he was a pioneer of nonrepresentational sculpture.
As a youth, Lipchitz studied engineering in Vilnius, Lithuania. When he moved to Paris in 1909, however, he became fascinated by French avant-garde art, and he began to study sculpture as an avenue to better understand modern art. After a brief term of service (1912–13) in the imperial Russian army, Lipchitz returned to Paris. There the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera introduced him to Pablo Picasso, the painter who (with Georges Braque) had created the Cubist style about 1907. Lipchitz soon began to translate the pictorial experiments of Cubist painters into three-dimensional sculpture, as in Man with Guitar (1916). Lipchitz worked exclusively in solid blocks of material or in low-relief still lifes to simulate the polychromatic prisms of Cubist paintings.
