Hiwassee River,  river rising in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Towns county, northern Georgia, U.S. It flows north into North Carolina past Hayesville, northwest past Murphy, into southeastern Tennessee, where it joins the Tennessee River 31 miles (50 km) northeast of Chattanooga at the Chickamauga Reservoir. The 132-mile (213-kilometre) long Hiwassee has three major Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) dams in its course—the Apalachia and the Hiwassee, in North Carolina, and the Chatuge, in North Carolina and Georgia. Snail darters, which had previously lived only on the Little Tennessee River, were transplanted to the Hiwassee River following a celebrated ecological controversy in the 1970s over the building of Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee. “Hiwassee” is probably derived from the Cherokee word meaning “meadow.”
