Galley,  large seagoing vessel propelled primarily by oars. The Egyptians, Cretans, and other ancient peoples used sail-equipped galleys for both war and commerce. The Phoenicians were apparently the first to introduce the bireme (about 700 bc), which had two banks of oars staggered on either side of the vessel, with the upper bank situated above the lower so as to permit the oars of the upper bank to clear the oars below. The addition of an outrigger permitted the employment of a third bank of oars, the rowers of which sat above and outside the other two; such a ship, which was called a trireme, was probably first constructed about 500 bc by the Greeks. References to even more banks (for example, the quinquireme) are believed to indicate a ship of very large size but with no more than two or three banks of oars.
A distinctive body of naval tactics based on the use of war galleys developed in the Mediterranean Sea from the 5th century bc on. In imitation of contemporary land warfare, the galleys cruised in columns, generally several abreast. Upon engaging the enemy they assumed a phalanxlike formation in lines abreast. In this manner each galley could give protection to its neighboursâ€™ exposed sides. At the same time it could confront the enemy with its bow, which was equipped with a ram, grappling irons, and missile-hurling devices.
