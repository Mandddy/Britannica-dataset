Annette, Freiin von Droste-Hülshoff, in full Anna Elisabeth Franziska Adolphine Wilhelmine Louise Maria, Freiin von Droste zu Hülshoff   (born Jan. 10, 1797, Schloss Hülshoff, near Münster, Westphalia [Germany]—died  May 24, 1848, Meersburg, Baden) poet and prose writer, among the most important poets of 19th-century Germany and the author of a novella considered a forerunner of 19th-century realistic fiction.
Born into a family of Roman Catholic aristocracy, she was educated by tutors and lived most of her life in isolation. She owed her introduction to literature to a young novelist, Levin Schücking (1814–83), for whom, despite their difference in age, she developed a deep, suppressed, and unreciprocated passion. Her first collection of poetry, Gedichte (1838; “Poems”), included poems of a deeply religious nature. Between 1829 and 1839 she wrote a cycle of religious poems, Das geistliche Jahr (1851; “The Spiritual Year”), which contains some of the most earnest religious poetry of the 19th century and reflects the inner turbulence and doubt of her spiritual life.
