Hand tool, any of the implements used by craftsmen in manual operations, such as chopping, chiseling, sawing, filing, or forging. Complementary tools, often needed as auxiliaries to shaping tools, include such implements as the hammer for nailing and the vise for holding. A craftsman may also use instruments that facilitate accurate measurements: the rule, divider, square, and others. Power tools—usually hand-held, motor-powered implements such as the electric drill or electric saw—perform many of the old manual operations and as such may be considered hand tools.
A tool is an implement or device used directly upon a piece of material to shape it into a desired form. The date of the earliest tools is extremely remote. Tools found in northern Kenya in 1969 have been estimated to be about 2,600,000 years old, and their state of development suggests that even older tools may remain to be discovered.
