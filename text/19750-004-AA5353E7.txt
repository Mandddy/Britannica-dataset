Stabiae, ancient town of Campania, Italy, on the coast at the eastern end of the Bay of Naples. It was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in ad 79. The modern city on the site is Castellammare di Stabia. Stabiae is part of the collective Torre Annunziata World Heritage site, designated by UNESCO in 1997.
The town was originally settled by Oscan-speaking people, the native inhabitants of Campania. It entered the Social War (the “war of the allies” against Rome) in 90 bc and was destroyed by Sulla on April 30, 89 bc. Its territory was given to Nuceria as a reward for loyalty to Rome. The area was noted for the medicinal properties of its waters, and the neighbourhood became a popular locality for villas. During the eruption of ad 79, the Roman fleet commander and naturalist Pliny the Elder perished at Stabiae, near the villa of his friend Pomponianus. Stabiae’s inhabitants were spared from the rushing nuées ardentes (a type of pyroclastic flow) that overwhelmed the people of Pompeii and Herculaneum; nevertheless, the town was buried in heavy ashfall. Subsequent settlement was of minor importance.
