Kobus,  genus of antelopes, family Bovidae (order Artiodactyla), containing about six species—the waterbucks and lechwes, the kob, and the puku.
Members of this genus are native to Africa south of the Sahara. They usually live in herds and are generally found near water, in such places as plains, woodlands, swamps, and flood plains. Shoulder height ranges from 75–100 centimetres (30–39 inches) in the puku (Kobus vardoni) to about 130 cm in the common (K. ellipsiprymnus) and defassa (K. defassa) waterbucks. Males of all species have long, heavily ridged horns that curve backward and then upward.
