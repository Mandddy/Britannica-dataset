Myxomycetes, also called Mycetozoa,  phylum of funguslike organisms within the kingdom Protista, commonly known as true slime molds. They exhibit characteristics of both protozoans (one-celled microorganisms) and fungi. Distributed worldwide, they usually occur in decaying plant material. About 500 species have been described.
The vegetative (active, growing, feeding) phase consists of a multinucleate amoeboid mass or sheet (plasmodium). This gives rise to fruiting structures (sporangia) with one to many spores at the head of a stalk. In nearly all species, spores are borne within the sporangium. In Ceratiomyxa, spores are apparently borne externally; each, however, may be a much-reduced sporangium with a true spore within.
