Francisco de Vitoria,  (born probably 1486, Vitoria, Álava, Castile—died August 12, 1546) Spanish theologian best remembered for his defense of the rights of the Indians of the New World against Spanish colonists and for his ideas of the limitations of justifiable warfare.
Vitoria was born in the Basque province of Álava. He entered the Dominican order and was sent to the University of Paris, where he was to remain as student and then lecturer for nearly 16 years. He returned to Spain in 1523 to lecture in Valladolid, and he had already begun his investigation of the morality of colonization when he was elected in 1526, by an enthusiastic majority of students, to the prime chair of theology at Salamanca.
