Universities of Paris I–XIII, French Universités de Paris I à XIII, formerly University of Paris,  universities founded in 1970 under France’s 1968 Orientation Act, reforming higher education. They replaced the former University of Paris, one of the archetypal European universities, founded about 1170.
The medieval University of Paris grew out of the cathedral schools of Notre-Dame and, like most other medieval universities, was a kind of corporate company that included both professors and students. With papal support, Paris soon became the great transalpine centre of Christian orthodox theological teaching. At the end of the 13th and during the 14th centuries, it was the most celebrated teaching centre of all Christendom. Its famous professors included Alexander of Hales, St. Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus, and Thomas Aquinas.
