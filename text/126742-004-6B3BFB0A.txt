Aquincum, important town in the Roman province of Pannonia; its ruins have been excavated in northern Budapest, Hung., near the west bank of the Danube River. At its peak, the civilian settlement reached as far as the military camp that was situated in what today is the district of Óbuda, just over a mile to the south, where the ruins of an amphitheatre are found.
Before the Roman town was founded, the site was settled by the Celtic Eravisci people and given the name Ak-ink (“Abundant Water”) because of the nearby thermal springs. A Roman military camp established there by Emperor Vespasian attracted a civilian population by the mid-1st century bce. Other factors contributing to the city’s growth included the fertile flatlands next to the river, the ease of crossing the Danube at that location, and the substantial traffic on the important road connecting the fortresses along the Danube limes (imperial boundary). The remains of the Contra Aquincum fortress, built on the east side of the Danube to defend the crossing, are on the Pest side of the Elizabeth Bridge in Budapest. In 106 Emperor Trajan made Aquincum the capital of Lower Pannonia (Pannonia Inferior); its proconsuls included Hadrian, later emperor, whose palace was erected on Óbuda Island. From the early 2nd century a Roman legion was stationed there.
