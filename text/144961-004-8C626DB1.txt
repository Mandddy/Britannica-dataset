Congaree River, river, central South Carolina, U.S., formed by the confluence of the Broad and Saluda rivers at Columbia. After a course of about 50 miles (80 km), part of which forms the boundary between Richland and Calhoun counties, the Congaree joins the Wateree River southeast of Columbia to become the Santee River. The Congaree was named for an Indian tribe. The Congaree Swamp, once some 110 square miles (285 square km) in area, is about 20 miles (30 km) southeast of Columbia and is one of the last of the South’s great virgin swamp forests. Its 700-year-old cypress and giant pine and oak trees have been described as “the forest of champions, the redwoods of the East.” A portion of this area became Congaree Swamp National Monument in 1976, which was redesignated as Congaree National Park in 2003.
