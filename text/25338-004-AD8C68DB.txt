John McLean,  (born March 11, 1785, Morris county, N.J., U.S.—died April 4, 1861, Cincinnati, Ohio) cabinet member and U.S. Supreme Court justice (1829–61) whose most famous opinion was his dissent in the Dred Scott decision (1857). He was also perhaps the most indefatigable seeker of the presidency in U.S. history; although he was never nominated, he made himself “available” in all eight campaigns from 1832 through 1860.
After two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1812–16), McLean was appointed as a judge in the Supreme Court of Ohio, a position he resigned in 1822 to become commissioner of the General Land Office under Pres. James Monroe. In 1823 he was named postmaster general and became noted for his efficiency and nonpartisanship in that office. After Pres. Andrew Jackson took office, McLean resigned in protest over Jackson’s open advocacy of the spoils system of political patronage, which undermined McLean’s recent reforms. Jackson thereupon appointed him an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
