Inverness-shire, also called Inverness,  historic county of northern Scotland. It is Scotlandâ€™s largest historic county and includes a section of the central Highlands, Glen Mor, and a portion of the Highlands to the north. It also encompasses several islands of the Inner and Outer Hebrides, such as Skye, Harris (part of Lewis and Harris), North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, Barra, and the Small Islands. Those of the Outer Hebrides (Harris, the Uists, Benbecula, and Barra) are part of the Western Isles council area, and the remainder of the county (including the Inner Hebrides and the entire mainland area) lies within the Highland council area.
Cairns, stone circles, and brochs (dry stone towers) provide evidence of prehistoric settlement in the county. When the area entered the historical record in Roman times, it was the home of the Picts. Inverness was the capital of the Picts under King Brude when St. Columba arrived about ad 565 to promote Christianity. When Scotland was united in subsequent centuries, Inverness-shire formed part of the province of Moray. The county came under the control of a succession of landowning dynasties during the Middle Ages, including the MacIntoshes, the Frasers, the Chisholms, and the Grants. Along the Atlantic coast the MacDonalds, Camerons, and MacLeods were subject to the Lords of the Isles. During the 15th and 16th centuries, however, the Stuart kings used the influence of the chiefs in the growing clan system to exert control over Inverness-shire.
