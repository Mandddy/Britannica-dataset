Marine, member of a military force especially recruited, trained, and organized for service at sea and in land operations incident to naval campaigns.
The use of marines goes far back in history. The 5th-century-bce Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides referred to epibatai, or heavy-armed sea soldiers in the Greek fleets, while Polybius, in the 3rd–2nd century bce, described milites classiarii (“soldiers of the fleet”), a category of Roman soldiers organized and specially armed for duty aboard warships.
