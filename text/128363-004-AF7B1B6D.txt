Adam Asnyk,  (born September 11, 1838, Kalisz, Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died August 2, 1897, Kraków, Austria-Hungary [now in Poland]) Polish poet and playwright renowned for the simplicity of his poetic style.
Asnyk’s family belonged to the minor gentry. His father, a soldier, spent two years as an exile in Siberia before returning to Poland to become a successful merchant. For a while Asnyk studied medicine in Warsaw, but his political activities caused him, in turn, to become an exile. A member of the Polish revolutionary government in 1863, he fled after the failure of the insurrection. He never returned to Russian-occupied Poland, settling eventually in Galicia, as the southern provinces of Poland incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Empire were called.
