Berwickshire, also called Berwick,  historic county, southeastern Scotland, on the North Sea. Berwickshire lies entirely within the Scottish Borders council area. The southern, lowland two-thirds of Berwickshire is called the Merse (March, or borderland) and supports considerable agriculture—especially, since the 18th century, extensive sheep farming. The northern, hilly portion of the county is known as Lammermuir. In the west Berwickshire includes most of the valley of Lauderdale.
Roman and early British camps were established in various parts of Berwickshire. During the Anglo-Saxon period the area formed part of Northumbria, and in the 6th and 7th centuries Christianity was introduced. The Danes were also present from the year 886. After the Battle of Carham (1016 or 1018) the area was annexed to Scotland. In 1296 Edward I of England crossed the River Tweed at Coldstream prior to the siege of the county town (seat) of Berwick-upon-Tweed, which after years of border warfare was finally ceded to England in 1482. Duns became the county town. Coldstream became the headquarters of the army in Scotland, and it was there in the 17th century that General George Monck’s regiment of foot was organized and renamed the Coldstream Guards.
