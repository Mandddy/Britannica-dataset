Sam Mendes, byname of Samuel Alexander Mendes  (born August 1, 1965, Reading, Berkshire, England) English film and theatre director who was known for his innovative treatments of classic stage productions as well as for his thought-provoking films.
Mendes was raised in London by his mother, a writer of children’s fiction; she and his father, a university professor, had divorced when Mendes was five. He attended the University of Cambridge, where he formed a theatre company with playwright Tim Firth. After graduating in 1987 with first-class honours in English, he accepted a job at the Chichester Festival Theatre in West Sussex, England. When the director of a production of the Dion Boucicault comedy London Assurance walked out, Mendes was summoned to take over. The play was a success and moved to London’s West End, where Mendes quickly made a name for himself, directing Dame Judi Dench in Anton Chekhov’s The Cherry Orchard. Stints with the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre followed.
