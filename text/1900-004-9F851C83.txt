Stan Kenton, byname of Stanley Newcomb Kenton   (born Feb. 19, 1912, Wichita, Kan., U.S.—died  Aug. 25, 1979, Los Angeles) American jazz bandleader, pianist, and composer who commissioned and promoted the works of many modern composer-arrangers and thrust formal education and big-band jazz together into what became the stage (or concert) band movement of the 1960s and ’70s, involving thousands of high school and college musicians.
Kenton began writing music in his teens, was a pianist and arranger for dance bands in the 1930s, and was influenced by Earl Hines as a pianist and by Claude Thornhill and Benny Carter as an arranger. Kenton formed his own band in 1940 and continued forming bands and touring almost until his death.
