Bream,  (Abramis brama), common European food and game fish of the carp family, Cyprinidae, found in lakes and slow rivers. The bream lives in schools and eats worms, mollusks, and other small animals. It is deep bodied, with flat sides and a small head, and is silvery with a bluish or brown back. Length is usually about 30–50 centimetres (12–20 inches), weight to 6 kilograms (13 pounds).
The silver bream (Blicca bjoorkna) is a relatively unimportant European relative of the bream. Other fishes called bream include the golden shiner, a minnow, and the sea breams of the family Sparidae.
