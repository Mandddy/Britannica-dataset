Entodiniomorph,  any ciliated protozoan of the order Entodiniomorphida. They are harmless parasites in the rumen and intestines of cattle, horses, and other herbivores. Entodiniomorphs are common and extremely numerous: one cow may harbour 10 billion or more. The cells are irregularly shaped, and extensive syncilia (specialized ciliary tufts) spiral into the anterior, elevated mouth. Several projections are found at the posterior of the cell; the largest is believed to serve as a rudder. It is possible that entodiniomorphs maintain a commensal or symbiotic relationship with their host by aiding digestion; for example, certain species digest cellulose. Entodiniomorphs reproduce asexually by binary fission and also exhibit the sexual phenomenon of conjugation. Representative genera include Cycloposthium, which is found in horses, and Diplodinium, which inhabits ruminants, such as cattle, antelopes, and dromedary camels.
