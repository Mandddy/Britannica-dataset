Elizabeth May, in full Elizabeth Evans May  (born June 9, 1954, Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.) American-born Canadian politician who became leader of the Green Party of Canada in 2006.
May grew up in Hartford, Connecticut, the daughter of political activists. In 1973 her family moved to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, and in 1978 she became a Canadian citizen. Throughout the 1970s May advocated for environmental issues, gaining particular attention for her attempts to stop the spraying of pesticides over forests in Nova Scotia. In 1980 she stood unsuccessfully for the federal House of Commons from a Nova Scotia riding as a candidate of the fledgling Small Party, of which she was a founding member and which laid the groundwork for the formation of the Green Party. May briefly attended both Smith and Williams colleges in the early 1970s and received an LL.B. from the Dalhousie University School of Law in 1983. From 1986 to 1988 she served as a senior policy adviser to Tom McMillan, the environment minister under Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and was credited with creating several national parks. After a new dam project was exempted from a full environmental impact assessment, May resigned in protest.
