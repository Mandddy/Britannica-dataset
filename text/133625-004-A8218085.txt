Franciscus Accursius, Italian Francesco Accorso   (born c. 1182, Bagnolo, Tuscany [Italy]—died c. 1260, Bologna) Italian legal scholar and leading jurist of the 13th century who was responsible for the renovation of Roman law. He was the last of a series of legal glossators (annotators) of Justinian’s compilation of Roman law.
A professor at the University of Bologna, Accursius had access to the many legal works of the Romans that had been brought from Ravenna in the 11th century, when the institution at Bologna was first established as a law school. This circumstance enabled Accursius to compile the authoritative Glossa ordinaria, also called the Glossa magna (the “Great Gloss”; 1220–50), which so far surpassed the glosses of earlier scholars that those works were rendered obsolete. For the next 500 years the Glossa of Accursius remained an indispensable complement to the texts of Roman law. His work made Roman law a popular course of study during the Renaissance period. Accursius’s interpretations of Roman law also influenced the development of later European legal codes, among them the Code Napoléon, or French Civil Code, enacted in the early 19th century.
