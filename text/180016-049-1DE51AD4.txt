Fever, also called pyrexia,  abnormally high bodily temperature or a disease of which an abnormally high temperature is characteristic. Although most often associated with infection, fever is also observed in other pathologic states, such as cancer, coronary artery occlusion, and disorders of the blood. It also may result from physiological stresses, such as strenuous exercise or ovulation, or from environmentally induced heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
Under normal conditions the temperature of deeper portions of the head and trunk does not vary by more than 1–2 °F in a day, and it does not exceed 99 °F (37.22 °C) in the mouth or 99.6 °F (37.55 °C) in the rectum. Fever can be defined as any elevation of body temperature above the normal level. Persons with fever may experience daily fluctuations of 5–9 °F above normal; peak levels tend to occur in the late afternoon. Mild or moderate states of fever (up to 105 °F [40.55 °C]) cause weakness or exhaustion but are not in themselves a serious threat to health. More serious fevers, in which body temperatures rise to 108 °F (42.22 °C) or more, can result in convulsions and death.
