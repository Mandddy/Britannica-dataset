Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus), also called lesser one-horned rhinoceros,  one of three Asian species of rhinoceros, found only on the island of Java in Indonesia. It is the rarest living rhinoceros and one of the world’s most endangered mammals. There are fewer than 50 surviving individuals, all restricted to Ujung Kulon National Park, a protected area on a small peninsula extending from the western end of Java.
Although only a few Javan rhinoceroses have ever been measured or weighed, the species is believed to be about the size of the black rhinoceros. Those individuals that have been examined were 2–3.2 metres (approximately 6–11 feet) in length and weighed 900–2,300 kg (about 2,000–5,100 pounds). Both males and females have lower incisors resembling tusks, which they use to fight, and the male has short horns about 25 cm (10 inches) long. Females reproduce at intervals of 3–5 years, giving birth to a single calf after a gestation period of 16 months.
