Cart,  two-wheeled vehicle drawn by a draft animal, used throughout recorded history by numerous societies for the transportation of freight, agricultural produce, refuse, and people. The cart, usually drawn by a single animal, is known to have been in use by the Greeks and the Assyrians by 1800 bc (although it is generally assumed that such vehicles could have been used as early as 3500 bc as an extension of the invention of the wheel).
Carts have been made in several ways, with emphasis usually placed upon simplicity of construction. The shafts were frequently but extensions of the framework of the body, and, depending upon the nature of the load to be hauled, the body itself might simply consist of a few crossed wooden stakes or a sturdy box.
