Malvina Hoffman,  (born June 15, 1887, New York, New York, U.S.—died July 10, 1966, New York City) American sculptor, remembered for her portraiture and for her unique sculptural contribution to Chicago’s Field Museum of Natural History.
Hoffman was the daughter of a noted English pianist. She leaned strongly toward an artistic career from an early age, and after studying painting for several years she took up sculpture, studying with Gutzon Borglum, who is perhaps best known for the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota. She went to Paris in 1910 and studied in the studio of Auguste Rodin. Her Russian Dancers won first prize in an international art exposition in that year. She opened a studio of her own in New York City in 1912, but from 1913 to 1915 she was again in Paris. In the latter year her Pavlowa Gavotte and Bacchanale Russe won wide attention.
