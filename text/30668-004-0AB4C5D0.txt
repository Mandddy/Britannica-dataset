Isak Dinesen, pseudonym of Karen Christence Dinesen, Baroness Blixen-Finecke   (born April 17, 1885, Rungsted, Denmarkâ€”died  September 7, 1962, Rungsted) Danish writer whose finely crafted stories, set in the past and pervaded with an aura of supernaturalism, incorporate the themes of eros and dreams.
Educated privately and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen, Dinesen married her cousin, Baron Bror Blixen-Finecke, in 1914 and went with him to Africa. There they owned and directed a coffee plantation in Kenya and became big-game hunters. After her divorce in 1921 she continued to operate the plantation for 10 years until mismanagement, drought, and the falling price of coffee forced her return to Denmark.
