Alexandre Benois, Russian in full Aleksandr Nikolayevich Benois   (born May 4 [April 21, old style], 1870, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  February 9, 1960, Paris, France) Russian theatre art director, painter, and ballet librettist who with Léon Bakst and Serge Diaghilev cofounded the influential magazine Mir iskusstva (“World of Art”), from which sprang the Diaghilev Ballets Russes.
Benois aspired to achieve a synthesis of new western European trends and certain elements of traditional Russian folk art; Mir iskusstva, established in 1899 in St. Petersburg, attacked the low artistic standards of the realist Peredvezhniki Society and the deadening influence of the Russian Academy and stressed individualism and artistic personality. The magazine, which he coedited until 1904, soon exerted great influence on stage design.
