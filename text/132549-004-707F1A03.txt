George du Maurier, in full George Louis Palmella Busson du Maurier   (born March 6, 1834, Paris, France—died Oct. 6, 1896, London, Eng.) British caricaturist whose illustrations for Punch were acute commentaries on the Victorian scene. He also wrote three successful novels.
Du Maurier’s happy childhood at Passy, France, is recalled in Peter Ibbetson (1891), and his full-blooded enjoyment of student life in the Latin Quarter of Paris is reflected in Trilby (1894). In The Martian (1897) there is a poignant episode based on his own tragic experience of losing the sight of his left eye. This misfortune obliged him to abandon painting in favour of drawing. In 1860 he moved to London, where his skilled draftsmanship and engaging personality quickly established his success. His gently satiric caricatures were mainly aimed at the growing nouveau riche class and the aesthetes led by Oscar Wilde. His book illustrations and drawings for such periodicals as Once a Week and The Leisure Hour, however, are sometimes considered his best work. His granddaughter, Daphne du Maurier, edited The Young George du Maurier: A Selection of His Letters, 1860–1867 in 1951.
