Ramakrishna, originally called Gadadhar Chatterji or Gadadhar Chattopadhyaya  (born February 18, 1836, Hooghly [now Hugli], Bengal state, Indiaâ€”died August 16, 1886, Calcutta [now Kolkata]) Hindu religious leader, founder of the school of religious thought that became the Ramakrishna Order.
Born into a poor Brahman (the highest-ranking social class) family, Ramakrishna had little formal schooling. He spoke Bengali and knew neither English nor Sanskrit. His father died in 1843, and his elder brother Ramkumar became head of the family. At age 23 Ramakrishna married Sarada Devi, a five-year-old girl, but, because of his advocacy of celibacy, the marriage was never consummated, even though they remained together until his death. (Sarada Devi was later deified and is still considered a saint by devotees who treat her as the Divine Mother.)
