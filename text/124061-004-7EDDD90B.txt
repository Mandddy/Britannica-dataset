Whistling duck (genus Dendrocygna), also called tree duck,  any of eight species of long-legged and long-necked ducks that utter sibilant cries and may make whirring wing sounds in flight; these distinctive ducks are separated from other members of the family Anatidae (order Anseriformes) as a tribe Dendrocygnini. Whistling ducks are sociable though aggressive. The sexes are nearly identical in plumage and behaviour, which includes mutual preening in some species. Whistling ducks fly with slow wingbeats and legs trailing. They sometimes perch in trees or on posts and walk readily with an upright stance. Although several species nest in hollow trees, ground sites are more often used. Drakes help build the nest and rear the young; in some species they also share in incubation.
Typical of the tribe is the fulvous tree duck (Dendrocygna bicolor), with isolated populations in North and South America, India, and Africaâ€”a most unusual world distribution and, remarkably, without geographic variation. It is mallard-sized, with a rusty brown body, a white rump, and creamy stripes on the flanks.
