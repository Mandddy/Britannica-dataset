Privet,  any of about 40 to 50 species of shrubs and small trees belonging to the genus Ligustrum of the family Oleaceae that are widely used for hedges, screens, and ornamental plantings. Privets—native to Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Mediterranean region—are evergreen or deciduous plants with opposite, usually oval, smooth-margined leaves; creamy-white, often odorous, terminal clusters of flowers; and one- to four-seeded black berries.
The hardy common privet (L. vulgare), native to northeastern Europe and Great Britain and naturalized in northeastern North America, is widely used as a hedge plant. It reaches about 4.5 m (15 feet). Glossy privet (L. lucidum), from eastern Asia, is a 9-metre tree in areas with mild winters. It has 25-centimetre (10-inch) flower clusters in summer. Japanese privet (L. japonicum), about 4.7 m tall, has very glossy leaves. It also requires mild winters, as does the smaller leaved California privet (L. ovalifolium) from Japan, commonly grown as a hedge plant. All four species have variegated forms.
