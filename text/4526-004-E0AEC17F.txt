Swallowtail butterfly (subfamily Papilioninae), any of a group of butterflies in the family Papilionidae (order Lepidoptera). The swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) are found worldwide except in the Arctic. They are named for the characteristic tail-like extensions of the hindwings, although many species are tailless. Colour patterns may vary, although many species have yellow, orange, red, green, or blue markings on an iridescent black, blue, or green background. Sexual and seasonal differences in coloration also occur. Many swallowtails mimic the coloration and patterns of butterflies that are protected by a bad taste.
The brightly coloured larvae feed on foliage. Black and yellow eyelike spots on the thorax of some larvae resemble the head of a snake. Many larvae have colour patterns that make them appear to be bird droppings. Many have scent glands and discharge a bad-smelling substance when disturbed.
