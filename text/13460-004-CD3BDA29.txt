Andronicus I Comnenus , also spelled Andronikos I Komnenos  (born c. 1118, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died September 1185, Constantinople) Byzantine emperor from 1183 to 1185, the last of the Comnenus dynasty, who attempted to reform the government but whose bitter opposition to Western Christianity precipitated a Norman invasion.
A cousin of the emperor Manuel I Comnenus (reigned 1143–80), Andronicus opposed the unpopular regency of the dowager empress Maria of Antioch after Manuel’s death. In the spring of 1182 he raised an army and entered Constantinople posing as the protector of the young emperor Alexius II; one of the results of his seizure of power was a massacre of the Westerners living in the city, mostly Pisans and Genoese. Soon after, he contrived the death of the dowager empress. In September 1183 he was crowned coemperor to Alexius and two months later had him strangled. To legitimize his usurpation, the 65-year-old Andronicus married Alexius’s 13-year-old widow.
