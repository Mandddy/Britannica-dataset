Fredrika Bremer,  (born August 17, 1801, Åbo, Swedish Finland [now Turku, Finland]—died December 31, 1865, Årsta, near Stockholm) writer, reformer, and champion of women’s rights; she introduced the domestic novel into Swedish literature.
Bremer’s father was a wealthy merchant who settled the family in Sweden when she was three. She was carefully educated and, as a young woman, travelled extensively in Europe. After her father’s death, her private means enabled her to devote her life to social work, travel, and writing. Her quiet domestic novels such as Familjen H*** (1830–31; The H— Family; also translated as The Colonel’s Family), Grannarna (1837; The Neighbours), and Hemmet (1839; The Home) were popular at home and abroad, with English translations produced during her lifetime by the poet Mary Howitt. Bremer visited the United States, where she was welcomed in New England as a kindred spirit for her antislavery sentiments. She met Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Nathaniel Hawthorne and wrote about her impressions in Hemmen i den nya verlden, 3 vol. (1853–54; The Homes of the New World). Her later novels Hertha (1856) and Fader och dotter (1858; Father and Daughter) deal with the social effects of the assertion of women’s rights.
