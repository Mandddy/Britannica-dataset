Erik XIV,  (born Dec. 13, 1533, Stockholm, Swed.—died  Feb. 26, 1577, Örbyhus) king of Sweden (1560–68) who expanded the powers of the monarchy and pursued an aggressive foreign policy that led to the Seven Years’ War of the North (1563–70) against Denmark.
Succeeding his father, Gustav I Vasa, in 1560, Erik soon obtained passage of the Articles of Arboga (1561), curtailing the powers of his half brothers, who had been granted large duchies by Gustav I. He consolidated his authority by establishing a special royal court of appeal and installing a new constitution (1562) that defined the nobility’s military obligations.
