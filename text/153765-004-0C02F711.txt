Thomas J. Sargent, in full Thomas John Sargent  (born July 19, 1943, Pasadena, California, U.S.) American economist who, with Christopher A. Sims, was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize for Economics. He and Sims were honoured for their independent but complementary research on how changes in macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, investment, and unemployment causally interact with government economic policies (Sargent) and with economic “shocks,” or unexpected events (such as a sudden rise in the price of oil) with at least short-term economic consequences (Sims).
Sargent received a B.A. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1964 and a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University in 1968. After serving in the U.S. Army as a systems analyst in the office of the assistant secretary of defense (1968–69), he taught at various universities in the United States until the early 1980s. He was a visiting scholar and later a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University from 1985. In the 1990s he held endowed chairs in economics at the University of Chicago and Stanford, and in 2002 he was appointed William R. Berkley Professor of Economics and Business at New York University.
