Natalie Cole, in full Natalie Maria Cole  (born February 6, 1950, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died December 31, 2015, Los Angeles) American singer, who forged a successful career performing rhythm and blues and jazz-based pop music.
The daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole, she earned a degree in child psychology from the University of Massachusetts in 1972. Although uncertain about pursuing a career in entertainment, she accepted a summer job singing with a band and was soon performing regularly. In 1974 she met Chuck Jackson and Marvin Yancy, songwriters and record producers who became frequent collaborators and helped her sign with Capitol Records. A string of rhythm-and-blues albums followed, beginning with her debut album, Inseparable (1975), which earned Cole two Grammy Awards, including one for best new artist. The following year Natalie was released, which went gold and received a Grammy for the hit single “Sophisticated Lady.” Her success continued with Unpredictable (1977) and Thankful (1977), both of which went platinum.
