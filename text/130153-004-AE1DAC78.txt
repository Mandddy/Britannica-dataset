Coccidium, plural Coccidia,   (order Coccidea), any of a large group of protozoan parasites of the sporozoan type. Coccidia live in both vertebrates and invertebrates, primarily in the lining cells of the intestine; they cause the disease coccidiosis. The two main phases in the life cycle are free-living oocysts (encapsulated zygotes), which are discharged by contaminated animals, and parasitic sporozoites, which live inside the animal. Reproduction occurs in both the sexual and asexual phases. Important genera include Isospora, Eimeria, and Plasmodium.
