Aster yellows, plant disease caused by a phytoplasma bacterium, affecting over 300 species of herbaceous broad-leafed plants. Aster yellows is found over much of the world wherever air temperatures do not persist much above 32 째C (90 째F). As its name implies, members of the family Asteraceae are vulnerable to infection, though the disease can affect a variety of common vegetables, garden plants, and wild species. Typical symptoms include yellowing (chlorosis) of young shoots, stiff and erect bunchy growth, greenish and distorted or dwarfed flowers, and general stunting or dwarfing. The phytoplasma lives in the phloem of infected plants and is transmitted by leafhopper insects when they feed on an infected plant and then on a healthy one. No transmission occurs through leafhopper eggs or plant seed. The phytoplasma is perpetuated in overwintering weed and crop plants, in propagative parts (bulbs, corms, tubers), and in leafhoppers in mild climates. The phytoplasma is destroyed in plants and leafhoppers subjected to temperatures of 38 to 42 째C (100 to 108 째F) for two to three weeks; thus, aster yellows is rare or unknown in many tropical regions.
Though the disease is not lethal, control is effected chiefly by promptly removing diseased plants and all overwintering susceptible weeds. Spraying or dusting with a contact insecticide repulses the leafhopper carriers.
