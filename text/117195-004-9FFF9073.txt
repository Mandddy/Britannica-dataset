Hawk owl,  any of numerous birds of prey of the family Strigidae (order Strigiformes).
The northern hawk owl (Surnia ulula) is approximately 40 cm (about 16 inches) long. Its tail is long, and its wings are short and pointed like those of a hawk. The facial disk of the northern hawk owl does not extend above the eyes, and it has no ear tufts. It feeds on small mammals, birds, and insects, hunting during the day rather than at night as do other owls. The range of the northern hawk owl is over northern Europe, northern Asia, and Canada.
