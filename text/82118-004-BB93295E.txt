Ringgit, monetary unit of Malaysia. The ringgit, also known as the Malaysian dollar, is divided into 100 sen. The Central Bank of Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia) has the exclusive authority to issue banknotes and coins in Malaysia. Coins are issued in denominations ranging from 1 sen to 1 ringgit. Banknote values are denominated from 1 to 100 ringgit. The obverse of each of the colourful bills contains a picture of Tuanku (King) Abdul Rahman, Malaysia’s first yang di-pertuan agong (paramount ruler). The reverse of most bills contains images of Malaysia’s economic infrastructure. For example, the Petronas Twin Towers (the world’s tallest structure) are featured on the 5-ringgit note; transportation, in the form of a plane, a train, and a cargo vessel, is the subject of the 10-ringgit note; and an oil rig is on the 50-ringgit note. The ringgit was established as the official monetary unit of Malaysia in 1946, when it replaced the Straits Settlement dollar, a colonial currency created in the mid-19th century.
