Salmonella (genus Salmonella), group of rod-shaped, gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Their principal habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and other animals. Some species exist in animals without causing disease symptoms; others can result in any of a wide range of mild to serious infections termed salmonellosis in humans. Most human infections with Salmonella result from the ingestion of contaminated food or water.
Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever; paratyphoid fever is caused by S. paratyphi, S. schottmuelleri, and S. hirschfeldii, which are considered variants of S. enteritidis.
