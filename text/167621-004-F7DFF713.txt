Danie Craven, byname of Daniel Hartman Craven  (born October 11, 1910, Lindley, South Africa—died January 4, 1993, Stellenbosch) South African rugby union football player, coach, and administrator who was one of the most influential and controversial figures in the history of the sport. He was known as “Mr. Rugby” in South Africa.
Craven played 16 Test (international) matches for South Africa, primarily as a scrum half, between 1931 and 1938. He served as vice-captain of the team on its 1937 tour of Australia and New Zealand and captained the team when it traveled to take on New Zealand at Carisbrook stadium in Dunedin and then again in the series against the British Lions (now the British and Irish Lions) in 1938. He also played a variety of other positions, including fly half, centre, and number eight, and even played a game at fullback for South Africa against Queensland. He was credited with perfecting the dive pass, which more rapidly delivered the ball from the scrum to the backs.
