Gian Carlo Menotti,  (born July 7, 1911, Cadegliano, Italy—died Feb. 1, 2007, Monaco) Italian composer, whose operas gained wider popularity than any others of their time. His realistic operas on his own librettos represent a successful combination of 20th-century dramatic situations with the traditional form of Italian opera. Menotti used largely traditional harmonies, resorting at times to dissonance and polytonality to heighten dramatic effect.
Menotti wrote his first opera, The Death of Pierrot, by the age of 11. He studied at the Milan Conservatory and in the late 1920s emigrated to the United States, where he continued his studies at the Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia (1928–33), at the suggestion of Arturo Toscanini. There he met Samuel Barber, who became his lifelong companion and frequent collaborator. Although Menotti worked extensively in the United States, he retained his Italian citizenship.
