Saint Anthony of Padua, Anthony also spelled Antony, Italian Sant’Antonio da Padova, original name Fernando  (born 1195, Lisbon, Portugal—died  June 13, 1231, Arcella, Verona [now in Italy]; canonized 1232; feast day June 13) Franciscan friar, doctor of the church, and patron of the poor. Baptized Ferdinand, he joined the Augustinian canons (1210) and probably became a priest. In 1220 he joined the Franciscan order, hoping to preach to the Saracens and be martyred. Instead, he taught theology at Bologna, Italy, and at Montpellier, Toulouse, and Puy-en-Velay in southern France, winning great admiration as a preacher. He died en route to Padua, Italy, where he is buried.
Anthony was the most celebrated of St. Francis of Assisi’s followers and had the reputation of a miracle worker. On January 16, 1946, Pope Pius XII declared him a doctor of the church. Padua and Portugal claim him as their patron saint, and he is invoked for the return of lost property. In art he is shown with a book, a heart, a flame, a lily, or the child Jesus. Among his authentic writings are sermons for Sundays and feast days, published at Padua in three volumes in 1979.
