Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata), also called spreading yew,  an ornamental evergreen shrub or tree of the yew family (Taxaceae), native to Japan and widely cultivated in the Northern Hemisphere. Rising to a height of 16 metres (about 52 feet), it resembles the English yew but is hardier and faster-growing. Each leaf has two distinct, yellowish bands on its underside. There are many horticultural varieties of Japanese yew. Plants propagated from cuttings of lateral branches tend to be prostrate and shrubby, while cuttings from leader shoots are erect and symmetrically conical. Several hybrids have been obtained by crossing the Japanese yew with the English yew; the most common, Taxus Ã—media, has about 10 varieties.
