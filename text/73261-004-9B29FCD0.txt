Right whale (family Balaenidae), any of four species of stout-bodied whales having an enormous head measuring one-quarter to one-third their total body length. From the 17th to 19th century, these whales were hunted for their oil and their strong, elastic baleen. Because of the considerable economic value of these products, this cetacean gained its name because it was the “right whale” to take.
The name right whale refers to the bowhead, or Greenland right whale (Balaena mysticetus), and to the whales of the genus Eubalaena (though originally only to E. glacialis). The bowhead has a black body, a white chin and throat, and, sometimes, a white belly. It can grow to a length of about 20 metres (65.6 feet), up to 40 percent of which is the strongly arched head. About 300 baleen plates line each side of the jaw, each plate measuring up to 4 metres long and 36 cm (14.2 inches) wide—although some 5-metre-long plates have been recorded. Bowheads are restricted to Arctic seas.
