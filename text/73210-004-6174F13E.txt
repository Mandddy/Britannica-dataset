El Lissitzky, byname of Eliezer Lissitzky, also spelled Elizar Lissitzky, Russian in full Lazar Markovich Lisitsky, Yiddish Lasar Markowitsch Lissitzky  (born November 11 [November 23, New Style], 1890, Pochinok, near Smolensk, Russia—died December 30, 1941, Moscow) Russian painter, typographer, and designer, a pioneer of nonrepresentational art in the early 20th century. His innovations in typography, advertising, and exhibition design were particularly influential.
Lissitzky received his initial art training in Vitebsk (now Vitsyebsk, Belarus), a city that would play a major role in the development of the Russian avant-garde. In 1903 he studied in the art school of Yehuda (Yury) Pen, but he soon left for Germany, dissatisfied with the provincial atmosphere of Vitebsk. Once in Germany, he enrolled in the department of architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, where he studied from 1909 to 1914. During this period he also traveled to France, Italy, and Belgium. When World War I broke out, he made his way back to Russia, settling in Moscow, and studied from 1915 to 1916 at the Riga (Latvia) Polytechnical Institute (now Riga Technical University), which had been evacuated to Moscow. Lissitzky took a degree in engineering and architecture and began work as a draftsman in an architect’s office.
