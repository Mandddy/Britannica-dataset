Edwin S. Porter, in full Edwin Stanton Porter, original name Edward Stanton Porter  (born April 21, 1870, Connellsville, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 30, 1941, New York, New York) pioneer American film director whose innovative use of dramatic editing (piecing together scenes shot at different times and places) in such films as The Life of An American Fireman (1903) and The Great Train Robbery (1903) revolutionized filmmaking.
Porter coinvented a device to regulate the intensity of an electric light in 1891. He subsequently opened a tailor business, but after that venture went bankrupt, he joined the U.S. Navy (1893–96). In 1896 several of Porter’s friends bought from Raff &amp; Gammon the exclusive rights to show films by using the Edison Company’s new Vitascope projector in Indiana and California, and Porter worked with them as a projectionist in Los Angeles and Indianapolis. Later that year he went to work for Raff &amp; Gammon in New York but left after the Edison Company broke with Raff &amp; Gammon. He then toured with vaudeville entertainers through the Caribbean as an exhibitor of motion pictures, and in early 1897 he helped build the projector at the Eden Musée, a wax museum and theatre in New York City. He then worked as an exhibitor in Canada during the summer of 1897 before returning to the Eden Musée as a projectionist.
