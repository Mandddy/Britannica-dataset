New-York Historical Society, museum and research institute of New York history, located on Central Park West, New York City.
Founded in 1804, the New-York Historical Society is New York City’s oldest museum. The collection was moved many times in the 19th century before being housed at its current location, a building on Central Park West purposely built for the museum. The building in which the New-York Historical Society is housed is one of the landmarks of the Central Park West Historic District. Notable exhibitions have included displays featuring Alexander Hamilton, the Hudson River School of painting, John J. Audubon’s paintings of birds, and the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center. There is also a permanent exhibition on slavery in New York. The New-York Historical Society is home to the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture. This permanent collection holds 40,000 artifacts, which represent the full spectrum of American material culture, from children’s toys to Tiffany lamps.
