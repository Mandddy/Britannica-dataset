Flight simulator, any electronic or mechanical system for training airplane and spacecraft pilots and crew members by simulating flight conditions. The purpose of simulation is not to completely substitute for actual flight training but to thoroughly familiarize students with the vehicle concerned before they undergo expensive and possibly dangerous actual flight training. Simulation also is useful for review and for familiarizing pilots with new modifications to existing craft.
Two early flight simulators appeared in England within a decade after the first flight of Orville and Wilbur Wright. They were designed to enable pilots to simulate simple aircraft maneuvers in three dimensions: nose up or down; left wing high and right low, or vice versa; and yawing to left or right. It took until 1929, however, for a truly effective simulator, the Link Trainer, to appear, devised by Edwin A. Link, a self-educated aviator and inventor from Binghamton, New York. By then, airplane instrumentation had been developed sufficiently to permit “blind” flying on instruments alone, but training pilots to do so involved considerable risk. Link built a model of an airplane cockpit equipped with instrument panel and controls that could realistically simulate all the movements of an airplane. Pilots could use the device for instrument training, manipulating the controls on the basis of instrument readings so as to maintain straight and level flight or controlled climb or descent with no visual reference to any horizon except for the artificial one on the instrument panel. The trainer was modified as aircraft technology advanced. Commercial airlines began to use the Link Trainer for pilot training, and the U.S. government began purchasing them in 1934, acquiring thousands more as World War II approached.
