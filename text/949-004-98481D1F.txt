Fyodor Vasilyevich Gladkov,  (born June 21 [June 9, old style], 1883, Chernavka, near Saratov, Russia—died  Dec. 20, 1958, Moscow) Russian writer best known for Tsement (1925; Cement, 1929), the first postrevolutionary novel to dramatize Soviet industrial development. Although crudely written, this story of a Red Army fighter who returns to find his hometown in ruins and dedicates himself to making industry thrive again anticipated in two important ways the future trends of Soviet literature. Its theme of reconstruction was to become commonplace in Soviet fiction following an official demand for “five-year-plan novels” in 1928; and its positive hero, whose confidence overcomes apathy and despair, became a model for the heroes of Socialist Realism.
A later novel, Energiya (1932–38; “Energy”), described the building of the Dneprostroi Dam but was overburdened with technical information. Outstanding among his later works is his volume of personal reminiscences, Povest o detstve (1949; “Story of Childhood”), which was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1950.
