Étienne Pivert de Senancour,  (born November 16, 1770, Paris, France—died January 10, 1846, Saint-Cloud) French author of Obermann (1804), one of several early 19th-century novels that describe the sufferings of a sensitive and tormented hero. Rediscovered some 30 years after it first appeared, the book appealed to the taste of the Romantics and their public.
Senancour’s father wanted him to enter the priesthood, but he fled to Switzerland in 1789 and made an unhappy marriage. His name was put on the list of émigrés after the French Revolution, and he did not return to France until 1803. Following the Restoration of 1815, he lived more or less as a recluse, writing for newspapers and reviews. In 1827 his Résumé de l’histoire des traditions morales et religieuses (1825; “Summary of the History of Moral and Religious Traditions”) was judged blasphemous, and he was sentenced to a fine and imprisonment, though the sentence was reversed on appeal.
