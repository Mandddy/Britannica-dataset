Narew River,  east-bank tributary of the Vistula River that rises in western Belarus and flows into eastern Poland. The Narew River is 272 miles (438 km) long and drains an area of more than 10,800 square miles (28,000 square km). It rises in the Belovezhskaya Forest in western Belarus and flows westward through wooded plains and marshlands. After entering Poland it swings north near Bialystok before turning west again, after which it is joined by the Biebrza and Pisa rivers. Swinging south again, the Narew receives its largest tributary, the Bug River, before itself joining the Vistula River at a point about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Warsaw.
