Brad Paisley, in full Brad Douglas Paisley  (born October 28, 1972, Glen Dale, West Virginia, U.S.) American country music singer-songwriter and guitarist who was one of the genre’s most popular performers in the early 21st century, known for skillfully crafted songs that were often laced with wry humour.
Paisley was raised in a small town in West Virginia. At age eight he received a guitar from his grandfather, who had introduced him to country music. After performing in church and at various local events, he formed a band with his guitar teacher. When Paisley was 12, he caught the attention of the program director of a radio station in nearby Wheeling, who invited him to perform on Jamboree USA, the station’s long-running live country music program. For the next eight years he polished his act as a regular on the show. In 1991 Paisley enrolled at West Liberty State College in West Liberty, West Virginia; he later transferred to Belmont University in Nashville, where he earned (1995) a bachelor’s degree in music business.
