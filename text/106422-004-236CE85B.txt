Ornette Coleman, in full Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman   (born March 9, 1930, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.—died June 11, 2015, New York, New York) American jazz saxophonist, composer, and bandleader who was the principal initiator and leading exponent of free jazz in the late 1950s.
Coleman began playing alto, then tenor saxophone as a teenager and soon became a working musician in dance bands and rhythm-and-blues groups. Early in his career, his approach to harmony was already unorthodox and led to his rejection by established musicians in Los Angeles, where he lived for most of the 1950s. While working as an elevator operator, he studied harmony and played an inexpensive plastic alto saxophone at obscure nightclubs. Until then, all jazz improvisation had been based on fixed harmonic patterns. In the “harmolodic theory” that Coleman developed in the 1950s, however, improvisers abandoned harmonic patterns (“chord changes”) in order to improvise more extensively and directly upon melodic and expressive elements. Because the tonal centres of such music changed at the improvisers’ will, it became known as “free jazz.”
