Septimius Severus, in full Lucius Septimius Severus Pertinax   (born April 11, 145/146, Leptis Magna, Tripolitania [now in Libya]—died Feb. 4, 211, Eboracum, Britain [now York, Eng.]) Roman emperor from 193 to 211. He founded a personal dynasty and converted the government into a military monarchy. His reign marks a critical stage in the development of the absolute despotism that characterized the later Roman Empire.
The son of an equestrian from the Roman colony of Leptis Magna, Severus entered the Senate about 173 and became consul in 190. At the time of the murder of the insane emperor Commodus on Dec. 31, 192, he was governor of Upper Pannonia (now in Austria and Hungary) and commander of the largest army on the Danube River. He remained inactive while the Praetorian Guards murdered Commodus’s successor, Publius Helvius Pertinax (March 193) and auctioned off the imperial title to Marcus Didius Julianus. Then on April 13 Severus was proclaimed emperor by his troops. Declaring himself the avenger of Pertinax, he marched on Rome. Julianus was murdered at Rome on June 1, and Severus entered the city without resistance several days later.
