Oh Sadaharu,  (born May 20, 1940, Tokyo, Japan) professional baseball player who played for the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants in the Japanese Central League for 22 seasons between 1959 and 1980 who holds the record for the most home runs ever hit. (See also Japanese baseball leagues). He is among the most revered of Japan’s sporting figures. Oh led the league in hitting 5 times, led in runs batted in (RBIs) 13 times, and was selected Most Valuable Player on 9 occasions. During Oh’s career with the Giants, they dominated Japanese baseball, winning the Japan Series 14 times, 9 of those times consecutively (1965–73).
In 1959 the left-handed hitter batted only .161. He then studied Zen Buddhism and several martial arts to improve his batting skills, and he adopted an unusual batting stance—known as the flamingo—in which he stood on one leg while awaiting the pitch. His batting philosophy involved an attitude far different from that found in American baseball. Oh once stated, “My opponents and I were really one. My strength and skills were only part of the equation. The other half was theirs.”
