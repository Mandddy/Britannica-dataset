South Bank, loosely defined area along the south bank of the River Thames in the London borough of Lambeth. It is bordered to the east by Bankside and extends approximately from Blackfriars Bridge (east) to Westminster Bridge (southwest). South Bank is home to a major arts complex—South Bank Centre—that includes Royal Festival Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room, and the Hayward Gallery.
Royal Festival Hall (1951) is used for concerts, recitals, and dance performances and is the home of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Its seating capacity is more than 3,000 for some types of performances. The Queen Elizabeth Hall, which seats about 1,000, and the smaller Purcell Room were opened in 1967. The Hayward Gallery (1968) hosts a variety of art exhibitions in both indoor and outdoor settings. The Poetry Library, with its 77-seat Voice Box for literary readings, also opened there in 1988.
