Aspendus, Greek Aspendos near modern Belkis,  ancient city of Pamphylia (modern Köprü), near the mouth of the Eurymedon (modern Köprü) River in southern Turkey, some 3 miles (5 km) from modern Belkis. It is noted for its Roman ruins. A wide range of coinage from the 5th century bc onward attests to the city’s wealth. In the 5th century bc Aspendus was a member of the Delian League and under Athenian influence. In the 4th century it was under Persian rule until it was occupied by Alexander the Great (333). In the Hellenistic Age it was dominated at various times by the Seleucids or the Ptolemies, until 189, when it passed to the Romans. The hilltop ruins of the city include a basilica, an agora (marketplace), and some rock-cut tombs of Phrygian design. A huge theatre, one of the finest in the world, is carved out of the northeast flank of the hill. It was designed by the Roman architect Zeno in honour of the emperor Marcus Aurelius (reigned ad 161–180).
