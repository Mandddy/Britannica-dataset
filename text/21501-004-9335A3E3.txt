Margaret Chase Smith, née Margaret Madeline Chase   (born Dec. 14, 1897, Skowhegan, Maine, U.S.—died May 29, 1995, Skowhegan)  American popular and influential public official who became the first woman to serve in both U.S. houses of Congress.
Margaret Chase attended high school in her native Skowhegan, Maine, graduating in 1916. She then taught school briefly, held a series of other jobs, and served as president of the Maine Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Clubs from 1926 to 1928. In 1930 she married Clyde H. Smith, a local political figure and co-owner of the Skowhegan Independent Reporter, for which she had earlier worked. From 1930 to 1936 she was a member of the state Republican committee, and after her husband’s election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1936 she worked as his secretary. When he suffered a heart attack in 1940, he urged her to run in his stead in the election that year. He died in April, and two months later she was chosen in a special election to complete his term. Almost immediately she displayed the independent judgment that became characteristic of her political career by breaking with her Republican colleagues to vote in September in favour of the Selective Service Act. In that month she was elected to a full term, and she was returned to her seat three more times.
