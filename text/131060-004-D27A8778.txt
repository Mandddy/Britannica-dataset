Snake eel, any of numerous marine fishes in the family Ophichthidae (order Anguilliformes). Representatives of the more than 200 species are found throughout the world, mostly in tropical or temperate waters. These snakelike creatures are more benign than their aggressive relatives, the morays. The tail of the snake eel is pointed and sharp compared with the flattened tail of the moray. The snake eel uses its tail to burrow backward into the sea bottom, creating a protective burrow. The spotted snake eel (Ophichthus ophis) of the southern Atlantic and Caribbean attains a length of 120 centimetres (4 feet).
