Charles VII, also called Charles Albert, German Karl Albrecht  (born Aug. 6, 1697—died  Jan. 20, 1745, Munich) elector of Bavaria (1726–45), who was elected Holy Roman emperor (1742–45) in opposition to the Habsburg Maria Theresa’s husband, Francis, grand duke of Tuscany.
Succeeding to the Bavarian throne in 1726, Charles Albert renounced any claims to the Austrian succession when he recognized the emperor Charles VI’s Pragmatic Sanction that established the Emperor’s daughter Maria Theresa as heiress of the Habsburg dominions. Charles Albert, however, maintained mental reservations since his wife was the daughter of the emperor Joseph I, and the Bavarian Wittelsbach claim to the throne was a legitimate one.
