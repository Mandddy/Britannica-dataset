Dinner at Eight, American comedy film, released in 1933, that was directed by George Cukor and featured an all-star cast. The witty and fast-paced film was based on the play by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber.
A dizzy socialite (played by Billie Burke) is so determined to keep her social status in high gear by inviting influential people to a dinner party that she all but ignores the deteriorating health and disastrous business concerns of her husband (Lionel Barrymore). The film also follows the partyâ€™s invitees, allowing each to present his or her own story or dilemma. Plotlines include the betrayal of a brash crooked businessman (Wallace Beery) by his social-climbing wife (Jean Harlow) and the melancholy tale of an aging actor (John Barrymore) who is unable to admit that his days of greatness are gone.
