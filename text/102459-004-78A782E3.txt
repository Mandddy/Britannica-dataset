Sir Giles Gilbert Scott,  (born Nov. 9, 1880, London, Eng.—died  Feb. 8, 1960, London) English architect who designed numerous public buildings in the eclectic style of simplified historical modes often termed 20th-century traditionalism.
Like his famous grandfather, Sir George Gilbert Scott, he was primarily a church builder, his greatest individual commission being for the new Liverpool Anglican Cathedral. The construction of this massive Gothic structure in red sandstone, begun in 1904, spanned Scott’s entire working life and was completed only in 1980 by two of his associates, F.G. Thomas and R.A. Pickney. He was knighted after the consecration ceremony in 1924. Among his many secular works were the library at the University of Cambridge (opened 1934); the Bodleian Library (1940), Oxford; the Waterloo Bridge (completed 1945), London; and the Battersea Power Station (completed in two sections [1933 and 1955]). He is also known for the creation of the iconic red public telephone boxes (booths). The first of these classical models appeared in 1924; the design was simplified in 1936. Both models were probably inspired by the tomb Sir John Soane built for himself in 1816.
