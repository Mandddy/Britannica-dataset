Jean-Paul Belmondo,  (born April 9, 1933, Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris, France) French motion picture actor who embodied the antiheroic spirit of the French New Wave in his early performances and later starred in and produced many commercially successful films that highlighted his graceful agility and easygoing charm.
The son of sculptor Paul Belmondo, Jean-Paul spent his childhood in close contact with the arts. After a turbulent education in which he often played the class clown, he had a brief stint as an amateur boxer, but he abandoned the ring to study acting at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art in Paris. Despite his obvious talent, the irreverent attitude he adopted toward his instructors prevented him from winning the highest honours when he graduated in 1956.
