Frank Loesser, in full Frank Henry Loesser  (born June 29, 1910, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died July 28, 1969, New York City) American composer, librettist, and lyricist, who achieved major success writing for Broadway musicals, culminating in the 1962 Pulitzer Prize-winning How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.
Self-taught despite his piano-teacher father’s efforts to discourage his youthful interest in popular song, Loesser dropped out of the City College of New York and worked at various nonmusical jobs before becoming a music publisher’s staff lyricist in the late 1920s. Little of his work was published until “I Wish I Were Twins” (1934) was recorded by Fats Waller. In 1936 Loesser moved to Hollywood, where he became an accomplished lyricist, collaborating with Hoagy Carmichael on “Small Fry” and “Two Sleepy People” and with Joseph J. Lilley on “Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.” Other composers for whom he wrote lyrics include Burton Lane, Jule Styne, Arthur Schwartz, Frederick Hollander, and Jimmy McHugh.
