Robert Jemison Van de Graaff,  (born Dec. 20, 1901, Tuscaloosa, Ala., U.S.â€”died  Jan. 16, 1967, Boston, Mass.) American physicist and inventor of the Van de Graaff generator, a type of high-voltage electrostatic generator that serves as a type of particle accelerator. This device has found widespread use not only in atomic research but also in medicine and industry.
After working for a time as an engineer with the Alabama Power Company, Van de Graaff went to Paris in 1924 to study at the Sorbonne. There the lectures of Marie Curie turned his interests to atomic physics, and the following year he went to the University of Oxford to do research in the laboratory of the Irish physicist J.S.E. Townsend. While at Oxford, Van de Graaff was impressed with the need for a source of energetic beams of subatomic particles for the study of atomic behaviour. He conceived the idea for the Van de Graaff generator and, upon returning to the United States in 1929, continued to develop it.
