August Hermann Francke,  (born March 22, 1663, Lübeck [Germany]—died June 8, 1727, Halle, Brandenburg) Protestant religious leader, educator, and social reformer who was one of the principal promoters of German Pietism, a movement of spiritual renewal that reacted to the doctrinal preoccupation of contemporary Lutheranism.
Influenced by the enthusiasm triggered by Philipp Jakob Spener’s initial Pietist impulses, Francke founded Pietist groups at the University of Halle, where he taught theology and Oriental languages (1695–1727). His conventicle was criticized by traditional Lutherans for its biblical revivalism and social activism, particularly the founding (1695) at Halle of the Franckesche Stiftungen (Francke Foundations), which included a school for the poor, orphanage, medical dispensary, and publishing house. Dismissed by the established church, Francke later received the favour of King Frederick William I of Prussia, who, influenced by a visit to the institutes (1713), initiated legislation for similar educational centres in his realm.
