Atmospheric brown cloud, a layer of air pollution containing aerosols such as soot or dust that absorb as well as scatter incoming solar radiation, leading to regional and global climatic effects and posing risks to human health and food security. This layer extends from Earth’s surface to an altitude of roughly 3 km (1.8 miles).
The presence of so-called brown clouds of pollution over urban areas has been of concern for decades. Urban brown clouds are heavily influenced by thermal inversions in the atmosphere and occur over several cities. Atmospheric brown clouds, in contrast, are a more widespread, regional phenomena. The first observations of these phenomena were made in the late 1990s as part of the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), in which coordinated air pollution measurements were taken from satellites, aircraft, ships, surface stations, and balloons. The INDOEX observations surprised researchers by revealing a large aerosol formation over most of South Asia and the northern Indian Ocean. This “Asian brown cloud” is an annual phenomenon that occurs primarily from November through May. Subsequent data have shown that atmospheric brown clouds are a global phenomenon and are associated with human-generated air pollution from Africa, North America, South America, and Europe, as well as Asia. Atmospheric brown clouds are particularly prevalent in tropical regions; they occur as a result of elevated pollutant emissions and a lengthy dry season that prevents aerosols from being removed from the atmosphere through precipitation.
