Sir Edward Sabine,  (born Oct. 14, 1788, Dublin—died  June 26, 1883, East Sheen, Surrey, Eng.) English astronomer and geodesist noted for his experiments in determining the shape of the Earth and for his studies of the Earth’s magnetic field.
He served in the Royal Artillery and was appointed astronomer to the Arctic expeditions of Sir John Ross (1818) and Sir William Parry (1819) in search of the Northwest Passage. In 1821 he began experiments on the coasts of Africa and North America and in the Arctic to determine the Earth’s shape more precisely by observing the motion of a pendulum. He published the first results of his work in 1825 and three years later continued his research in Paris and London.
