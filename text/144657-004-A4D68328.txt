Lee Teng-hui,  (born January 15, 1923, near Tan-shui, Taiwan) first Taiwan-born president of the Republic of China (Taiwan; 1988–2000).
Lee attended Kyōto University in Japan and National Taiwan University (B.A., 1948) and studied agricultural economics in the United States at Iowa State University (M.A., 1953) and Cornell University (Ph.D., 1968). While a professor of economics at National Taiwan and National Chengchi universities (1958–78), he was a member of Taiwan’s Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. During this period Lee contributed much to Taiwan’s agricultural development, promoting farmers’ associations, irrigation systems, and agricultural mechanization and supporting the Agricultural Development Act, which balanced agricultural and industrial development. In 1978 he was elected mayor of Taipei, and he later served as governor of Taiwan province (1981–84) before becoming vice president under Chiang Ching-kuo in 1984. After Chiang’s death in 1988, Lee became president of Taiwan and acting chairman of the ruling party, the Kuomintang (KMT). His election to the KMT post later in the year further strengthened his position, and in 1990 he was reelected president by an overwhelming majority of members of the National Assembly. In 1996 Lee won Taiwan’s first direct popular presidential election.
