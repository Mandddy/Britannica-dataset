Alice Marble,  (born September 28, 1913, Plumes county, California, U.S.—died December 13, 1990, Palm Springs, California) American tennis player, known for her powerful serves and volleys, who dominated the women’s game during the late 1930s.
Marble was introduced to baseball by an uncle and resolved to become a professional baseball player. Marble’s older brother introduced her to tennis in the hopes of diverting her to a “less masculine” sport. She played the game aggressively and pioneered the women’s serve-and-volley style of play (wherein a player rushes up toward the net after a serve). Her early pitching practice lent itself to a powerful tennis serve, and her excellent hand-to-eye coordination and speed gave her an exceptional game at the net.
