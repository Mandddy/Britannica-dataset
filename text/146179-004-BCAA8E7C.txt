IPod, portable media player developed by Apple Inc. and released in 2001 for the company’s Macintosh platform. A version for the Microsoft Corporation’s Windows operating system was released in 2002. The small, sleekly designed player, coupled with its accompanying online music store, has been one of the most successful and revolutionary products of the 2000s.
Apple’s chief executive officer, Steven Jobs, who recognized potential in the nascent personal media player market, commissioned Apple engineer Jon Rubinstein to create a product in keeping with Apple’s minimalist, user-friendly style. Tied to Apple’s iTunes media management software and originally touting the ability to put 1,000 songs in a consumer’s pocket, the iPod was easy to use and featured a simple, clean design. Small white earbud headphones became an iconic trademark of the product in Apple’s pervasive and award-winning advertising campaigns. With its ease of use and eventual cross-platform compatibility, the device gained market dominance beyond any Apple had ever enjoyed in the personal computer (PC) sector.
