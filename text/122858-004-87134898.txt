Rope, assemblage of fibres, filaments, or wires compacted by twisting or braiding (plaiting) into a long, flexible line. Wire rope is often referred to as cable. The basic requirement for service is that the rope remain firmly compacted and structurally stable, even while the rope is bent, twisted, and pulled. The prime property of a rope is its tensile strength.
The texture and the nature of a rope is determined by the colour, fineness, stiffness, strength, and stretchability of the fibres or filaments used in its construction. Cotton ropes, for example, are softer, weaker, and stretchier than manila or sisal ropes. Manila ropes are stronger, for a given size, than hemp or jute ropes. Since even short fibres can be spun into long flexible yarns, practically any fibre can be made into a rope.
