Coursing,  the pursuit of game by hounds hunting by sight and not by scent. In modern, organized coursing competitions, two greyhounds at a time pursue one hare. The dogs are judged on performance as well as on their success in catching the hare: points are awarded for outracing the other dog and catching up with the hare, for turning it at a right angle, for wrenching (turning it at less than a right angle), for tripping the hare, and for a kill. Coursing was fully described about ad 150 by the Greek philosopher and historian Arrian in his Cynegeticus (translated as Arrian on Hunting).
The sport became very popular in England, Ireland, and Scotland during the 16th century, and the first known set of rules was drawn up by Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk. The “laws of the leash,” as they were called, laid down principles upon which the sport has since been based.
