Martin Heidegger,  (born September 26, 1889, Messkirch, Schwarzwald, Germanyâ€”died May 26, 1976, Messkirch, West Germany) German philosopher, counted among the main exponents of existentialism. His groundbreaking work in ontology (the philosophical study of being, or existence) and metaphysics determined the course of 20th-century philosophy on the European continent and exerted an enormous influence on virtually every other humanistic discipline, including literary criticism, hermeneutics, psychology, and theology.
Heidegger was the son of a sexton of the local Roman Catholic church in Messkirch, Germany. Although he grew up in humble circumstances, his obvious intellectual gifts earned him a religious scholarship to pursue his secondary education in the neighbouring town of Konstanz.
