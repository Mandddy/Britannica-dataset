Domitian, Latin in full Caesar Domitianus Augustus, original name (until ad 81) Titus Flavius Domitianus  (born Oct. 24, ad 51—died Sept. 18, ad 96, Rome [Italy]) Roman emperor (ad 81–96), known chiefly for the reign of terror under which prominent members of the Senate lived during his last years.
Titus Flavius Domitianus was the second son of the future emperor Vespasian and Flavia Domitilla. During the civil war of ad 69 over the imperial crown, Domitian remained unharmed in Rome, but on December 18 he took refuge in the Capitol with his uncle Flavius Sabinus, escaping into hiding when the Capitol was stormed by supporters of Vitellius. On the entry of his father’s supporters into Rome two days later he was saluted as Caesar, and he became praetor next year. He attempted to turn the repressive military campaign of Petillius Cerialis in the Rhineland into a triumphal operation of his own; and for this and other excesses he is said to have required his father’s pardon when the latter arrived at Rome in autumn ad 70. Domitian, however, was princeps juventutis (an imperial prince) and was consul six times in Vespasian’s lifetime; moreover, it was recognized that he would eventually succeed his brother Titus, who had no son and was 11 years older than Domitian. On Vespasian’s death, in June 79, Domitian expected the same position as Titus had received under Vespasian, in particular, tribunician power and some form of imperium. These were not granted, and Domitian was evidently antagonistic to his brother and is alleged to have hastened his death, which occurred on Sept. 13, 81.
