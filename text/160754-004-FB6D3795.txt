Vladimir Zhirinovsky, in full Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky  (born April 26, 1946, Almaty, Kazakhstan, U.S.S.R.) Russian politician and leader of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) from 1991. Known for his fiery Russian nationalism and broad anti-Semitic asides, he later acknowledged his Jewish roots.
Much of Zhirinovsky’s personal history is vague, unknown, or disputed. He left his hometown at age 18 to attend Moscow State University, where he studied Turkish and other languages. After graduating about 1969, he went to work as a translator in Turkey, but he was expelled under murky circumstances eight months later. From 1970 to 1972 he served as an army lieutenant in the Caucasus. After returning to Moscow in 1972, he worked in various state committee and union posts. He completed an evening law program at Moscow State University, earning his degree in 1977 and then working in a state-run law firm (from which he was later asked to resign). In 1983 Zhirinovsky landed a position as head of the law department at the Mir publishing company, a post that served as a springboard for his political career. When the local council held elections in 1987, Zhirinovsky sought to run as the firm’s candidate and as an independent, but he was disallowed by the Communist Party and by Mir, which cited a letter from his previous employer that questioned his ethics.
