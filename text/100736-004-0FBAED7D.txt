Social network, in computers, an online community of individuals who exchange messages, share information, and, in some cases, cooperate on joint activities.
Eschewing the anonymity that had previously been typical of the online experience, millions of people have flocked to social networking sites where members create and maintain personal profiles that they link with those of other members. The resulting network of “friends” or “contacts” who have similar interests, business goals, or academic courses has replaced for many people, especially youth, older concepts of community. The most basic social networking software allows friends to comment on one another’s profiles, send private messages within the network, and traverse the extended web of friends visible in each member’s profile. More advanced networking sites enable members to enhance their profiles with audio and video clips, and some open their software source code to allow third-party developers to create applications or widgets—small programs that run within the member’s profile page. These programs include games, quizzes, photo-manipulation tools, and news tickers. A popular application sometimes draws thousands of members to a given profile, generating demand for the application developer’s services and driving up the value of that profile within the community. At its best, a social networking site functions as a hive of creativity, with users and developers feeding on each others’ desire to see and be seen. Critics, however, see these sites as crass popularity contests, in which “power users” pursue the lowest common denominator in a quest to gain the most friends. With hundreds of millions of unique visitors using dozens of such sites worldwide, it is certainly possible to observe both extremes—often within the same group of “friends.”
