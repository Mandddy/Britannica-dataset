Stephen Báthory, Hungarian István Báthory, Polish Stefan Batory  (born Sept. 27, 1533, Szilágysomlyó, Transylvania [now in Romania]—died  Dec. 12, 1586, near Grodno, grand duchy of Lithuania [now Hrodno, Belarus]) prince of Transylvania (1571–76) and king of Poland (1575–86) who successfully opposed the Habsburg candidate for the Polish throne, defended Poland’s eastern Baltic provinces against Russian incursion, and attempted to form a great state from Poland, Muscovy, and Transylvania.
The son of another István Báthory, the governor of Transylvania for the Habsburg king of Hungary, Stephen entered the service of John Sigismund Zápolya, prince of the newly independent Transylvania, in 1556. He eventually became army commander in chief, and despite Habsburg objections the Hungarians elected him prince of Transylvania in succession to Zápolya on May 25, 1571.
