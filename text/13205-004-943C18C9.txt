Lucille Ball, in full Lucille Désirée Ball   (born August 6, 1911, Celoron, near Jamestown, New York, U.S.—died April 26, 1989, Los Angeles, California) radio and motion-picture actress and longtime comedy star of American television, best remembered for her classic television comedy series I Love Lucy.
Ball determined at an early age to become an actress and left high school at age 15 to enroll in a drama school in New York City. Her early attempts to find a place in the theatre all met with rebuffs, and she took a job as a model under the name Diane Belmont. She was moderately successful as a model, and a poster on which she appeared brought her to the attention of the Hollywood studios and won her spots in Roman Scandals (1933), Blood Money (1933), Kid Millions (1934), and other movies.
