He also was instrumental in establishing the first U.S. college gymnasium.
Graduated from the University of Giessen as a doctor of civil and canonical law (1818), Follen taught there and in the universities of Jena in Germany and of Basel in Switzerland between 1818 and 1824. His activity in revolutionary movements for German national unity and civic freedom precluded any extended academic career.
