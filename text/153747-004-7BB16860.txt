Battle of Cowpens, (January 17, 1781), in the American Revolution, brilliant American victory over a British force on the northern border of South Carolina that slowed Lord Cornwallis’s campaign to invade North Carolina. British casualties were estimated at about 600, whereas the Americans lost only 72.
From his headquarters at Charlotte, North Carolina, the new American commander in the South, Gen. Nathanael Greene, had divided his army and sent a force of 1,000 men under Gen. Daniel Morgan to the southwest to intercept Cornwallis’s advance. The two forces converged at Cowpens, an area so named because it was a well-known enclosed pasturing field for cows. There Morgan confronted about 1,150 troops under Col. Banastre Tarleton, who had intended to seize the strategic crossroads at Ninety Six, South Carolina. Morgan employed three progressively stronger defensive lines: a front line of skirmishers deployed behind trees, followed by Southern militia troops, and, finally, the regular Continental Army troops supported by Col. William Washington’s cavalry reserve, positioned out of sight of Tarleton’s forces.
