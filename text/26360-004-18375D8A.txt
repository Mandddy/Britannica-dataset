Jakob Johannes Sederholm,  (born July 20, 1863, Helsinki, Fin., Russian Empire—died  June 26, 1934, Helsinki) geologist who pioneered in the study of the Precambrian rocks (those from 3.96 billion to 570 million years old) of Finland. He was appointed geologist to the Geological Commission of Finland in 1888, and from 1893 to 1933 he was its director.
Sederholm vigorously promoted and directed the commission in producing excellent maps, reports, and scientific treatises. His studies concentrated on the origin of granites and the stratigraphy, age, and correlation of the rocks. His Om granit och gneis (1907; “On Granite and Gneiss”) includes an English summary. Other translated works include On Migmatites and Associated Pre-Cambrian Rocks of Southwestern Finland, 3 vol. (1923–24), and On the Geology of Fennoscandia with Special Reference to the Pre-Cambrian (1932).
