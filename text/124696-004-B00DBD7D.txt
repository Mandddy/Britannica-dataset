Leopard moth,  (Zeuzera pyrina), widely distributed insect of the family Cossidae (order Lepidoptera), known particularly for its destructive larva.
The adult moth has a fluffy white body and pale wings (span about four to six centimetres) with numerous black or blue spots and blotches. They fly at night and are strongly attracted to bright lights. Larvae bore into stems of shrubs and trees, especially apples, pears and plums, where they do much damage by eating the heartwood. When fully grown the larva is about 5 cm long, white and fleshy with black spots and a dark head capsule. Development takes two or three years.
