Mariah Carey,  (born March 27, 1970, Huntington, New York, U.S.) American pop singer, noted for her remarkable vocal range. She was one of the most successful female performers of the 1990s.
Carey, whose mother was a vocal coach and former opera singer, began performing as a child. After graduating (1987) from high school in Greenlawn, New York, she moved to New York City to pursue a singing career. She made a demo tape that led Tommy Mottola, an executive at Columbia Records, to sign her in 1988; the couple married in 1993. Her debut album, Mariah Carey (1990), showcased her incredible vocal range and blended several musical genres, including gospel, pop, and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). It was a huge success, and in 1991 Carey won Grammy Awards for best new artist and best female pop vocalist. That same year the title track from her follow-up album, Emotions, became her fifth consecutive chart-topping single. Subsequent hit albums include Music Box (1993) and Daydream (1995), both of which sold some 10 million copies in the United States, as well as the holiday-themed Merry Christmas (1994). All the recordings were accompanied by music videos that helped make Carey a fixture on the cable network MTV.
