Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Sydney that took place Sept. 15–Oct. 1, 2000. The Sydney Games were the 24th occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
Sydney was narrowly chosen over Beijing as host city of the 2000 Olympics. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was attracted to the city’s long history of enthusiasm for sports, its promise to use recovered toxic wastelands as sites for sporting venues, and its plan to involve the smaller countries of Oceania in hosting activities. Despite some cost overruns and a ticket scandal, the preparations and the Games themselves went smoothly. The opening ceremonies celebrated the history of Australia, especially the unique culture and contributions of the Aborigines, the indigenous people of the continent. The high point of the opening ceremonies came when Aborigine runner Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic flame. She later won the gold medal in the 400-metre event. The accomplishments and recognition of Freeman were an important milestone for Australian Aborigines, who were still struggling for their place in Australian society (see Sidebar: Cathy Freeman: The Heart of a Nation).
