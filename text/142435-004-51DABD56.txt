Pack animal, any domesticated animal that is used to carry freight, goods, or supplies. The ass or donkey is the oldest-known pack animal, having been in use possibly as early as 3500 bc. Pack animals are most often used in terrain where wheeled vehicles would encounter difficulty. Camels, for example, are used in the desert, horses and mules are used in mountainous terrain, and water buffalo function in marshy areas. The type of animal used is usually native to the region in which it is used. Pack animals include oxen, reindeer, elephants, llamas, sheep, goats, yaks, and dogs. In many places in the world, the use of pack animals is the only feasible means of transporting a load.
