Humphrey Lyttelton, byname Humph  (born May 23, 1921, Eton, Eng.—died April 25, 2008, London)  British trumpeter, clarinetist, bandleader, and composer who was the leading force in English jazz for more than 50 years. In his later years he was perhaps best known as the host of a BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) weekly radio comedy titled I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue. The program, which was a send-up of panel shows, was noted for its word play, ribaldry, and plain silliness.
Lyttelton’s father was a housemaster at Eton College, and both parents were amateur musicians. By age 15 Lyttelton had discovered jazz and, inspired primarily by Louis Armstrong, had begun teaching himself trumpet. After serving in the military during World War II, Lyttelton joined George Webb’s Dixielanders in 1947 and formed his own band the following year. His early group (which recorded with Sidney Bechet in 1949) featured clarinetist Wally Fawkes and was a Dixieland revival group that performed the music of the 1920s. In the mid-1950s the band shifted toward swing music.
