Timiş River, Hungarian Temes, Romanian Timişul, Serbo-Croatian Tamiš,  river, rising in the Cernei Mountains at the western end of the Southern Carpathian Mountains in Romania, and flowing north, west, then south in an arc through Caransebeş and Lugoj to enter the Danube River at Pančevo, east of Belgrade, Serbia, after a course of 211 miles (340 km). Its exit from the Carpathians, via the Domaneşnea gap, forms part of the important Timiş-Cerna Gap (between the Western and Southern Carpathians) that links the Tisza River plain and the city of Timişoara (north) with the Danubian Plain (south). Beyond the Domaneşnea gap the Timiş flows in a wide alluvial floodplain. Its major tributary is the Bârzava. The Timiş is navigable only for small craft.
