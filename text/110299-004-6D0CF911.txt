Rudolph Fisher, in full Rudolph John Chauncey Fisher  (born May 9, 1897, Washington, D.C., U.S.â€”died Dec. 26, 1934, New York, N.Y.) American short-story writer and novelist associated with the Harlem Renaissance whose fiction realistically depicted black urban life in the North, primarily Harlem.
Fisher was raised chiefly in Providence, R.I., where he received B.A. and M.A. degrees from Brown University. He attended medical school at Howard University in Washington, D.C., graduating in 1924. He had begun placing fiction in prominent magazines such as the Atlantic Monthly by 1925, just as mainstream American literary publishers were becoming fascinated by the Harlem Renaissance. Moving to New York City in 1925, Fisher met other black writers including Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, James Weldon Johnson, Walter White, and Jessie Redmon Fauset, as well as the white literary celebrity Carl Van Vechten, a major booster of black arts and letters.
