Bode Miller, in full Samuel Bode Miller  (born October 12, 1977, Easton, New Hampshire, U.S.) American Alpine skier who won six Olympic medals—more than any other American skier—and won the men’s World Cup overall championship in 2005 and 2008.
Miller was born in the heart of the White Mountains. His parents were self-styled hippies who lived deep in the woods in a house with no electricity or running water, and Miller was homeschooled until the fourth grade. After his parents divorced, his mother took him to nearby Cannon Mountain while she worked, often leaving him in the care of the ski school staff. At age 11 he began skiing competitively.
