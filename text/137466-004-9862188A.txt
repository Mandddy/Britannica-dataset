Chris Carter,  (born October 13, 1957, Bellflower, California, U.S.) American writer and producer who was best known for the television series The X-Files (1993–2002) and its related films.
Carter graduated from California State University at Long Beach in 1979 with a degree in journalism and took a job as associate editor for Surfing magazine. During his five years there, Carter tried his hand at screenwriting. A script about three young men going off to Vietnam never made it to the big screen, but it encouraged him to write a second script—this time a comedy. Although that too was a failure, it brought him to the attention of Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was then chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg hired him as a writer for The Disney Sunday Movie, and Carter’s interests switched from movies to television.
