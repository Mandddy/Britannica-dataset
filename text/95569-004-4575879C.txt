Joan Aiken, in full Joan Delano Aiken   (born September 4, 1924, Rye, Sussex, England—died January 4, 2004, Petworth, West Sussex) prolific British author of fantasy, adventure, horror, and suspense tales for both juvenile and adult readers. Perhaps best-known as the inventor of a genre called the “unhistorical romance,” Aiken wrote tales that combine humour and action with traditional mythic and fairy tale elements. Many of these works are set in an invented historical era during the imagined reign of James III of England, who was known as the Old Pretender.
Aiken was the daughter of the poet Conrad Aiken. While still a student, she had two poems published in The Abinger Chronicle, a prestigious little magazine, and at age 18 her first short story was published. As an adult, she wrote radio scripts and worked as a librarian for the United Nations. In 1955 she became an editor for the literary magazine Argosy and later was a copywriter for an advertising agency.
