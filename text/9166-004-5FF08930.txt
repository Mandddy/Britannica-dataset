Suwannee River, river, rising in the Okefenokee Swamp, southeastern Georgia, U.S., and meandering generally south-southwestward across northern Florida to enter the Gulf of Mexico at Suwannee Sound after a course of 250 miles (400 km). All but 35 miles (56 km) of the river’s course are in Florida.
The stream is the Swanee River of Stephen Foster’s famed song “Old Folks at Home.” The river was named Guasaca Esqui (“River of Reeds”) by early Native American inhabitants, and its present name is thought to be a corruption of San Juanee (“Little St. John”). In the 1780s the secluded bays and inlets of Suwannee Sound were rendezvous points for pirates.
