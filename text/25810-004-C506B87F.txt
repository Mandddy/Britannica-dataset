Mark Rutherford, pseudonym of William Hale White   (born Dec. 22, 1831, Bedford, Bedfordshire, Eng.—died  March 14, 1913, Groombridge, Sussex) English novelist noted for his studies of Nonconformist experience.
While training for the Independent ministry, White lost his faith and became disillusioned with what he saw as the narrowness of Nonconformist culture. He practiced journalism, then spent the rest of his life in the civil service at the Admiralty. The story of his inner life, however, is largely told in his novels and other writings, published under the name of Mark Rutherford. The Autobiography of Mark Rutherford (1881) and Mark Rutherford’s Deliverance (1885) are autobiographical fictions describing White’s progress from Protestant Christianity to a form of Wordsworthian pantheism. His later novels are The Revolution in Tanner’s Lane (1887), Miriam’s Schooling and Other Papers (1890), Catherine Furze (1893), and Clara Hopgood (1896). White wrote with a quiet intensity. All of his books deal with religious problems or with ordeals of the heart, the intellect, or the conscience. He published a translation of Spinoza’s Ethics in 1883.
