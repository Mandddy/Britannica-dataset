Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, American vocal group that helped define the Motown sound of the 1960s and was led by one of the most gifted and influential singer-songwriters in 20th-century popular music. In addition to Smokey Robinson, byname of William Robinson (b. February 19, 1940, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), the principal members of the group were Warren Moore (b. November 19, 1939, Detroit), Bobby Rogers (b. February 19, 1940, Detroit—d. March 3, 2013, Southfield, Michigan), Ronnie White (b. April 5, 1939, Detroit), and Claudette Rogers (b. 1942). Whether writing for fellow artists Mary Wells, the Temptations, or Marvin Gaye or performing with the Miracles, singer-lyricist-arranger-producer Robinson created songs that were supremely balanced between the joy and pain of love. At once playful and passionate, Robinson’s graceful lyrics led Bob Dylan to call him “America’s greatest living poet.”
Coming of age in the doo-wop era and deeply influenced by jazz vocalist Sarah Vaughan, Robinson formed the Five Chimes with school friends in the mid-1950s. After some personnel changes, the group, as the Matadors, auditioned unsuccessfully for Jackie Wilson’s manager. However, they greatly impressed Wilson’s songwriter Berry Gordy, who soon became their manager and producer. Most importantly, Gordy became Robinson’s mentor, harnessing his prodigious but unformed composing talents, and Robinson, assisted by the Miracles, became Gordy’s inspiration for the creation of Motown Records.
