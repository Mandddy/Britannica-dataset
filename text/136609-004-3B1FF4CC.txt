Alexander McQueen, in full Lee Alexander McQueen  (born March 17, 1969, London, England—found dead February 11, 2010, London) British designer known for his groundbreaking clothes, shocking catwalk shows, and precise tailoring.
McQueen grew up in London’s East End; he was the youngest of six children of a father who was a taxicab driver and a mother who was a social studies teacher and genealogist. At age 16 McQueen left school and was employed at London’s Anderson &amp; Sheppard, where he tailored suits for Mikhail Gorbachev and Prince Charles. After working for another tailor and a theatrical costumer, he took work with the Japanese designer Koji Tatsuno in London and then with Romeo Gigli in Italy. McQueen returned to London and enrolled at the fashion college Central Saint Martins (1990–92). There he staged a fashion show for his master’s thesis. The show caught the eye of Isabella Blow, a London stylist. Blow bought McQueen’s entire first collection.
