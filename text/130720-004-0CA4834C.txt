Bhikku,  (Pāli), feminine bhikkunī, Sanskrit bhikṣu, or (feminine) bhikṣuṇī,  in Buddhism, one who has renounced worldly life and joined the mendicant and contemplative community. While individuals may enter the monastic life at an early age—some renunciate communities include children in their pre-teens—a candidate for ordination must be 21 years of age, have parental permission, and be physically healthy, free of debt, and possessed of a sound mind.
The term bhikku comes from a verbal root meaning “to beg.” Thus, a Buddhist monk or nun is marked primarily by his or her practice of poverty and nonattachment to the material world. Originally, bhikkus were the mendicant followers of the Buddha (6th century bc) who had left their families and worldly pursuits in order to meditate and to apply the Buddha’s teachings to their everyday life. Bhikkus tended to live as a group in forest retreats near villages and towns; in exchange for food, the monks taught the townspeople the ways of religious righteousness (dhamma; Sanskrit: dharma). Buddhist texts indicate that in the beginning the Buddha allowed only men to enter the monastic community (the sangha) but later permitted women to take vows as well. However, the female monastic order has never been as large as the male one.
