Andrey Nikolayevich Tupolev,  (born October 29 [November 10, New Style], 1888, Pustomazovo, Russia—died December 23, 1972, Moscow) one of the Soviet Union’s foremost aircraft designers, whose bureau (see Tupolev) produced a number of military bombers and civilian airliners—including the world’s first supersonic passenger plane.
In 1909 Tupolev entered the Moscow Imperial Technical School (now Bauman Moscow State Technical University), where he became a student and disciple of Nikolay Y. Zhukovsky, widely considered the father of Russian aviation. In 1918 they organized the Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute, of which Tupolev became assistant director in 1918. He became head of the institute’s design bureau in 1922 and supervised the work of various designers—including Pavel O. Sukhoy (see Sukhoy design bureau), Vladimir M. Myasischev, and Vladimir M. Petlyakov—who later became notable in their own right. This bureau, in producing military and civilian planes that were designated by Tupolev’s initials, ANT, made all-metal construction a standard feature of Soviet aviation.
