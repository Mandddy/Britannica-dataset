Georgy Valentinovich Plekhanov,  (born November 29 [December 11, New Style], 1856, Gudalovka, Russia—died May 17 [May 30], 1918, Terioki, Finland [now Zelenogorsk, Russia]) Marxist theorist, the founder and for many years the leading exponent of the Marxist movement in Russia. A Menshevik, he opposed the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia in 1917 and died in exile.
Plekhanov was born into a family of the minor gentry. In 1873 he enrolled in St. Petersburg’s Konstantinovskoe Military School and soon transferred to the Mining Institute, but during his second year there, he abandoned his studies to devote himself entirely to a populist revolutionary movement. Although this movement aimed to foment a peasant upheaval and to establish an agrarian socialist society, Plekhanov’s activity involved him particularly with urban factory workers. After becoming a leader of the populist organization Land and Freedom in 1877, he engaged in underground political agitation. When Land and Freedom turned increasingly to terrorist methods, Plekhanov formed an antiterrorist splinter group to continue mass agitation. This faction was, however, short-lived, and in 1880 Plekhanov went abroad to avoid arrest. He did not return to Russia until 1917.
