Walther von Reichenau,  (born Oct. 8, 1884, Karlsruhe, Ger.—died  Jan. 17, 1942, in flight near Poltava, Ukraine, U.S.S.R.) German field marshal who commanded the army that captured Warsaw (1939) and the 6th Army in its encircling movement through Belgium (1940) on the Western front during World War II.
The son of a general of the artillery, von Reichenau followed his father’s career, joining an artillery unit in 1903. During World War I he served on the German general staff, and in the early days of the Nazi regime he was regarded as one of Hitler’s favourites. He was raised to the rank of lieutenant general in the Polish campaign in 1939 and was made a field marshal in July 1940 in recognition of his generalship in the French blitzkrieg a month earlier. Marshal von Reichenau was in command of the German army that scored initial successes against Marshal S.M. Budenny’s Russian forces in the Ukraine campaign in the fall of 1941. In November 1941 von Reichenau’s armies met defeat at the hands of Marshal S.K. Timoshenko, and he was driven out of Rostov. A Bern dispatch Jan. 17, 1942, said Marshal von Reichenau died of apoplexy while flying back to Germany “for reasons of health.”
