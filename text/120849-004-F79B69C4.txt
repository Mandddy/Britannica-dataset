Vaux-le-Vicomte, château near Melun, France, designed in 1656 by Louis Le Vau for Nicolas Fouquet, who was finance minister to King Louis XIV. The château, finished in 1661, is considered to be one of the masterpieces of French Baroque residential architecture. The exquisite interior decoration was supervised by the painter Charles Le Brun. The garden, designed by André Le Nôtre, was the prototype of the gardens that Le Nôtre later designed for Louis XIV at Versailles. Many critics, however, prefer the ingenuity of Vaux-le-Vicomte to the repetition of Versailles.
Fouquet entertained the king at his lavish château in August 1661, and three weeks later the finance minister was arrested on charges of treason. Many of the works of art from Vaux-le-Vicomte were transferred into the king’s collections. For royal building projects, including Versailles, the king took into service Le Vau, Le Brun, and Le Nôtre and the team of artists, craftsmen, and gardeners they had assembled at Vaux-le-Vicomte.
