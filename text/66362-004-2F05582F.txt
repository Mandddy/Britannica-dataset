John Cheever,  (born May 27, 1912, Quincy, Massachusetts, U.S.—died June 18, 1982, Ossining, New York) American short-story writer and novelist whose work describes, often through fantasy and ironic comedy, the life, manners, and morals of middle-class, suburban America. Cheever has been called “the Chekhov of the suburbs” for his ability to capture the drama and sadness of the lives of his characters by revealing the undercurrents of apparently insignificant events. Known as a moralist, he judges his characters from the standpoint of traditional morality.
Cheever himself was born into a middle-class family, his father being employed in the shoe business then booming in New England. With the eventual failure of the shoe industry and the difficulties of his parents’ marriage, he had an unhappy adolescence. His expulsion at age 17 from the Thayer Academy in Massachusetts provided the theme for his first published story, which appeared in The New Republic in 1930. During the Great Depression he lived in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Cheever married in 1941 and had three children. In 1942 he enlisted in the army to train as an infantryman, but the army soon reassigned him to the Signal Corps as a scriptwriter for training films. After the war Cheever and his wife moved from New York City to the suburbs, whose culture and mores are often examined in his subsequent fiction.
