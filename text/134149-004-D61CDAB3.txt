Kakinomoto Hitomaro, also called Kakinomoto no Hitomaro   (died 708, Japan) poet venerated by the Japanese since earliest times. He was also Japan’s first great literary figure.
Among his surviving works are poems in the two major Japanese poetic forms of his day—tanka and chōka. Probably he also wrote sedōka (“head-repeated poem,” consisting of two three-line verses of 5, 7, 7 syllables), a relatively minor song form that seems to have been first adapted to literary purposes by Hitomaro and to have barely survived him. All of the poems accepted as indisputably authored by Hitomaro (61 tanka and 16 chōka), as well as a large number of others attributed to him, are to be found in the Man’yōshū (“Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves”), the first and largest of Japan’s anthologies of native poetry. These poems, together with notes by the compilers, are the chief source for information on his life, about which very little is known.
