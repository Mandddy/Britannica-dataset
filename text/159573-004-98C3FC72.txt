Ellen Burstyn , original name Edna Rae Gillooly, early professional name Ellen McRae  (born December 7, 1932, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.) American actress who was known for her understated charm and versatility.
Gillooly was raised in Detroit, though she attended St. Mary’s Academy in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, for several years in the late 1930s. Both her mother and her stepfather were physically and verbally abusive, and in 1950, several credits short of graduating from Cass Technical High School, Gillooly left home. After stints in Dallas and Montreal, she relocated to New York City in 1954 and soon secured a bit part in a television musical. Assuming the stage name Edna Rae, she began appearing on The Jackie Gleason Show (1956–57), and under the name Ellen McRae she debuted on Broadway in 1957 in Fair Game. She married the play’s director, Paul Roberts, in 1958 (divorced 1962) and two years later accompanied him to Hollywood. There she accepted a series of minor film roles and television guest spots, including on Perry Mason (1962). In 1964 she was cast in director Vincente Minnelli’s Goodbye Charlie, her first significant studio picture. She returned to New York later that year, began studying with Lee Strasberg at The Actors Studio, and in 1964 married actor and writer Neil Burstyn (also known as Neil Nephew; divorced 1972).
