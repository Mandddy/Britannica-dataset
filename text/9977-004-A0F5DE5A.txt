Pantomimus, plural pantomimi ,  nonspeaking dancer in the Roman theatre who performed dramatic scenes, acting all the characters in a story in succession using only masks, body movement, and rhythmic gestures. The pantomimus, whose name means “imitator of everything,” was the central figure of an entertainment that became fashionable in Rome during the reign of Augustus (63 bce–14 ce) and remained popular throughout the history of the Roman Empire.
The Roman pantomime differed from its equally popular sister form, mime, in two ways: its themes were usually loftier, avoiding the farce and coarse humour that were common in mime; and, unlike the mime actor, the pantomimus wore various masks, which identified the characters but precluded the actor’s use of facial expressions. Thus the art of the pantomimus was primarily one of posture and gesture, in which hand movements were particularly expressive and important. (For a more detailed treatment of these two forms, see mime and pantomime.)
