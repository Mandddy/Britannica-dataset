Canker, disease of plants that is caused by numerous species of fungi and bacteria and that occurs primarily on woody species. Symptoms include round-to-irregular, sunken, swollen, flattened, or cracked, discoloured, and dead areas on the stem (cane), twig, limb, or trunk. Cankers may enlarge and girdle a twig or branch, killing the foliage beyond it. They are most common on plants weakened by cold or drought stresses, insect injury, nutritional imbalances, nematodes, or root rot.
Control includes removing diseased parts in dry weather; growing adapted or resistant varieties in warm, well-drained fertile soil; avoiding overcrowding, overwatering, and mechanical wounds; treating bark and wood injuries promptly; controlling insect and rodent disease carriers; wrapping young trees to prevent sunscald; and keeping plants vigorous by the use of fertilizers.
