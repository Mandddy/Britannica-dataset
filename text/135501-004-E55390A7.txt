Henry Arthur Jones,  (born Sept. 20, 1851, Grandborough, Buckinghamshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 7, 1929, London) English playwright who first achieved prominence in the field of melodrama and who later contributed to Victorian “society” drama.
In 1879 his play Hearts of Oak was produced in the provinces, and he won fame in London with The Silver King (first performed 1882; written with Henry Herman). Additional melodramatic plays that also achieved popularity followed, such as Michael and His Lost Angel (1896). But Jones was by now moving in high society, and a vein of more sophisticated comedy was beginning to appear in works such as The Case of Rebellious Susan (1894) and The Liars (1897). His plays, however, display a rigid acceptance of the Victorian moral code. While this conservative attitude lost him the sympathy of new liberal audiences, his works were much more commercially viable than those of George Bernard Shaw, who was among Jones’s followers in Britain, and of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. Jones’s plays show considerable skill in theatrical construction, and Mrs. Dane’s Defence (1900) has a finely wrought cross-examination scene. Jones was a controversialist who wrote and lectured widely about the function of theatre, notably in The Renaissance of the English Drama, 1883–94 (1895).
