Horace Everett Hooper,  (born Dec. 8, 1859, Worcester, Mass., U.S.—died  June 13, 1922, Bedford Hills, N.Y.) U.S. publisher of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1897 until his death, a master salesman and an innovator in publishing.
Hooper left school at the age of 16, clerked in bookstores for a time, and then went to Denver, Colo., where he organized the Western Book and Stationery Company to sell books in the western states. In 1893 he moved to Chicago, where he directed a highly successful advertising and sales campaign for the Century Dictionary. While visiting London in 1897 he became convinced that the 9th edition (1875–89) of the Britannica could be marketed by similar methods. With Walter Montgomery Jackson and the brothers James and George Clarke, he secured reprint rights from A. and C. Black, the work’s publishers, and then persuaded The Times (London) to support the venture. Times officials expected meagre financial results, but Hooper’s reduction of the price and his institution of an installment payment plan greatly stimulated sales. He then began to prepare an 11-volume supplement, which, added to the 9th (24 volumes and index), formed the 10th edition (1902–03).
