Berry, historical and cultural region encompassing the Indre and Cher départements in the Centre région of central France. It is coextensive with the former province of Berry, which included the départements of Cher (roughly corresponding to Upper Berry) and Indre (Lower Berry).
The home of a people called the Bituriges Cubi in Roman times, the country later passed to the Visigoths (ad 475), the Franks (c. 507), and the Carolingians. The chief authority in Berry eventually passed to the viscounts of Bourges, who, while recognizing the royal suzerainty, preserved a certain independence until 1101, when the fief was sold to the crown. When Aquitaine was acquired by Henry II of England, Berry became a matter of dispute between England and France. After 1360 it was held as an appanage of the French crown, usually by a member of the royal family. Jean de France, duc de Berry (1340–1416), was an important patron of the arts, for whom a number of famous illuminated manuscripts were produced (notably the Limbourg brothers’ Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry).
