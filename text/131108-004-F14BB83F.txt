Eugenia, large genus of chiefly tropical, mostly aromatic, evergreen shrubs and trees of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae). The leaves are opposite; the flowers are solitary or in small clusters. The fruit is an edible berry, usually tart, and is commonly made into jam or jelly. Some Asian species, formerly considered part of the genus, may be listed under Syzygium.
Syzygium aromaticum (sometimes E. caryophyllata), the clove tree, which occurs in the West Indies and Indonesia, produces flowers that are removed as buds, dried, and sometimes processed to yield clove oil. The whole clove and its extract are used in flavouring; the oil is also used medicinally (see clove). Many species of Eugenia yield high-grade lumber. The bark of E. cymosa of Indonesia is the source of a black dye. Other species are widely used in the tropics and subtropics as ornamentals.
