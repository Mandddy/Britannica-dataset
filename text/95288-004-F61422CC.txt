Katmai National Park and Preserve, large area of wilderness and unique geologic features in southwestern Alaska, U.S., at the head of the Alaska Peninsula on Shelikof Strait. Katmai was designated a national monument in 1918 after the violent eruption of Novarupta Volcano there in 1912. The monument’s boundaries were changed several times between 1931 and 1980, when it became a national park and preserve. The park’s area is 5,741 square miles (14,869 square km); the preserve covers an additional 654 square miles (1,694 square km).
The 1912 eruption of Novarupta converted a green valley into an ash-filled wasteland known as the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The valley was found to contain a vast number of fumaroles when first viewed in 1916, but they subsided as the ash cooled, and today only a few are active. It is thought that the summit of nearby volcanic Mount Katmai subsided and collapsed as magma beneath it drained away; the resultant crater filled with water and became a lake. Since the eruption the Ukak River and its tributaries have cut gorges into the ash that accumulated in the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.
