Charles Comiskey, in full Charles Albert Comiskey, byname the Old Roman  (born Aug. 15, 1859, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—died Oct. 26, 1931, Eagle River, Wis.) baseball player, manager and owner during the formative years of professional baseball, and one of the founders of the American League.
Comiskey began playing semiprofessional baseball in 1876 and in 1882 joined the St. Louis Brown Stockings (later known as the Browns) in the first year of operation of the American Association, a league formed to challenge the National League (NL), which had begun six years earlier. As a player, Comiskey transformed the way first basemen played when he positioned himself away from the first base bag in order to prevent hits to right field. Comiskey became a player-manager with St. Louis in 1883 and led the team to four league championships during the 1880s. In 1890 he joined the Chicago Pirates in the Players’ League, a circuit established when the NL sought to limit the pay of players. After a brief one-year return to the Browns in 1891, Comiskey played and managed the Cincinnati Reds for the last three years of his on-the-field career.
