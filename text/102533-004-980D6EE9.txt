Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), U.S. satellite, one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) “Great Observatories” satellites, which is designed to identify the sources of celestial gamma rays. In operation from 1991 to 1999, it was named in honour of Arthur Holly Compton, one of the pioneers of high-energy physics.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, satellites built to detect nuclear explosions by emitted gamma rays yielded many false reports. It was realized that momentary random “bursts” of gamma radiation wash across the solar system from sources beyond. The primary objective of CGRO was to determine whether these gamma-ray bursts are within the Milky Way Galaxy and of modest energy or are in remote galaxies and of extreme energy.
