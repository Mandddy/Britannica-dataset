Flat grain beetle,  any member of the insect family Silvanidae (order Coleoptera), closely related to and sometimes included in the flat bark beetle family Cucujidae. These beetles are usually less than 3 millimetres (0.1 inch) in length.
Many species live under the bark of trees. Others (e.g., the saw-toothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis) feed on grains and have become serious pests wherever grain is stored.
