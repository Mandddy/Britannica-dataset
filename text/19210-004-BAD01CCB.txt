Nebuchadrezzar I,  (flourished 12th century bce) most famous Babylonian king (reigned 1119–1098 bce) of the 2nd dynasty of the Isin.
In revenge for earlier humiliating conquests and defeats that the Elamites had inflicted on Babylonia, Nebuchadrezzar led a grand campaign that resulted in the capture of Susa, the capital of Elam. The victory marked the end of Elam’s domination of the region (the kingdom subsequently disintegrated into petty states) and afforded the return of the stolen cult statue of Marduk to its holy place at Esagila (Marduk was to become the national deity of Babylon). Nebuchadrezzar was less successful in raids against Assyria.
