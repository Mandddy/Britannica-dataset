Georg Forster, in full Johann Georg Adam Forster   (born Nov. 26, 1754, Nassenhuben, near Danzig, Pol.—died  Jan. 12, 1794, Paris, France) explorer and scientist who helped to establish the literary travel book as a favoured genre in German literature.
With his father, Johann Reinhold Forster, he emigrated to England in 1766. Both were invited to accompany Capt. James Cook on his second voyage around the world (1772–75). Georg Forster’s account of the journey, A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World (1777), was based on his father’s journals; it later appeared in a German version, Reise um die Welt (1778–80). A work of travel, science, and literature, the book not only established Forster as one of the most accomplished stylists of the time but also influenced German scientific and literary writing, including that of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Johann Gottfried von Herder, and Alexander von Humboldt. A superb essayist, Forster contributed to the scientific, especially botanical, knowledge of the South Seas.
