Steen Steensen Blicher,  (born October 11, 1782, Vium, Jutland, Denmark—died March 26, 1848, Spentrup, Jutland) Danish poet and short-story writer who portrayed the people of Jutland with humour and irony and with a realism well in advance of his time.
An unhappily married, impoverished country parson, Blicher led an outdoor life—walking, shooting game, and talking to peasants, Gypsies, farmers, and squires. Thus, he acquired an impressive command of the Jutland dialect and the materials for his short stories. His first volume of original poems appeared in 1814, and his subsequent poetry expressed both humour and a melancholy acceptance of life. In the “Prelude” to Trækfuglene (1838; “Birds of Passage”), his finest collection of poems, he presents a self-portrait of a caged bird longing for freedom. As his private life worsened, Blicher took to drink.
