Jerry Seinfeld, byname of Jerome Seinfeld  (born April 29, 1954, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.) American comedian whose television show Seinfeld (1989–98) was a landmark of American popular culture in the late 20th century.
Seinfeld’s interest in comedy was sparked at an early age through the influence of his father, a sign maker who was also a closet comedian. By age eight Seinfeld was putting himself through a rigorous comic training, watching television day and night to study the techniques of comedians. Over the years, he developed a unique style of comedy that centred on his wry observations on life’s mundanities. He made his stand-up debut in 1976 and worked his way to an appearance on The Tonight Show in 1981, which gave Seinfeld his first national exposure. By the late 1980s he was one of the highest-profile stand-up comedians in the United States.
