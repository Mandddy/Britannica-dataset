Equine, one of the mammal family of Equidae (order Perissodactyla) that includes the modern horses, zebras, and asses, as well as more than 60 species known only from fossils.
All six modern members of the family are placed in the genus Equus. Only the races of E. caballus (including the myriad domestic strains) are called horses; three species (E. zebra, E. burchelli, and E. grevyi) are called zebras; and two (E. asinus and E. hemionus) are usually called wild asses.
