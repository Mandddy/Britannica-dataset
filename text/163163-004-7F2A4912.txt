Delmira Agustini,  (born Oct. 24, 1886, Montevideo, Uruguay—died  July 6, 1914, Montevideo) one of the most important poets of South America.
Agustini was the first woman in Latin-American literature to deal boldly with the themes of sensuality and passion, and her poems have a force lacking from most Modernist poetry of the period. Her life ended tragically when she was murdered by her estranged husband. Her chief works are El libro blanco (1907; “The White Book”), Cantos de la mañana (1910; “Morning Songs”), Los cálices vacíos (1913; “Empty Chalices”), El rosarío del Eros (1924; “Eros’ Rosary”), and Obras completas (1924; “Complete Works”).
