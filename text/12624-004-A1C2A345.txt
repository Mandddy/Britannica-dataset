James Gould Cozzens,  (born Aug. 19, 1903, Chicago—died  Aug. 9, 1978, Stuart, Fla., U.S.) American novelist, whose writings dealt with life in middle-class America.
Cozzens grew up on Staten Island, N.Y., graduated from the Kent (Conn.) School (1922), and attended Harvard University for two years. In a year of teaching in Cuba he accumulated background material for the short novels Cockpit (1928) and The Son of Perdition (1929). He gained critical attention in 1931, when his novella S.S. San Pedro won the Scribner’s prize. Thereafter he published increasingly complex novels, most of which focus on professional people. In The Last Adam (1933) the protagonist is a doctor; Men and Brethren (1936) depicts the life of an Episcopalian minister; The Just and the Unjust (1942) and By Love Possessed (1957) are about lawyers; and Guard of Honor (1948) concerns air force officers and men. Ask Me Tomorrow (1940) is an autobiographical novel, and Children and Others (1964) is a short-story collection.
