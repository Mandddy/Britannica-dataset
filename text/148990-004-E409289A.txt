AOL, formerly called America Online,  one of the largest Internet-access subscription service companies in the United States, providing a range of Web services for users. AOL was one of the first companies to establish a strong sense of community among its users through buddy lists and instant messaging services, which transmit billions of messages daily.
Founded in 1989 in Dulles, Virginia, the company initially served only users of Apple Computer’s Macintosh and Apple II machines, expanding to include personal computers running Microsoft Corporation’s Windows OS (operating system) in 1993. America Online grew in popularity throughout the 1990s, becoming the leading Internet service provider in the United States. In 2000 AOL merged with Time Warner Inc., in a deal that subsequently proved disappointing to both parties. America Online officially changed its name to AOL on April 3, 2006. In December 2009 it was spun off as an independent company.
