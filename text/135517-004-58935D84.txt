Thomas Mudge,  (born Sept. 1717, Exeter, Devon, Eng.—died Nov. 14, 1794, Newington Place, Surrey) considered England’s greatest watchmaker, who was the inventor of the lever escapement, the most dependable and widely used device for regulating the movement of the spring-driven watch.
Mudge served as apprentice to the watchmaker George Graham before opening his own a shop a few doors away in Fleet Street in 1750. The quality of Mudge’s work brought him commissions from Ferdinand VI of Spain, the engineer John Smeaton, and other influential persons throughout Europe. He invented the lever escapement about 1755, introducing it on a smaller scale in a watch that he made in 1770 for King George III, then given to Queen Charlotte of England.
