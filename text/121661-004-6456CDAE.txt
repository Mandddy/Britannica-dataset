Quanzhou, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’üan-chou, conventional Chüan-chow,  port and city, eastern coastal Fujian sheng (province), China. It is situated on the north bank of the Jin River, at the head of the river’s estuary, facing the Taiwan Strait. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 497,723; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 1,463,000.
A Quanzhou prefecture was established there in 618 ce. The only sizable settlement in the present area was Nan’an county—some 12.5 miles (20 km) up the Xi River valley—which had been set up in the 6th century by the Nan (Southern) Chen regime (557–589). The present Quanzhou was founded in 700 as Wurongzhu; its name was changed to Quanzhou in 711, and it was established as a county seat; it was a convenient administrative centre for the scattered Chinese settlements in the area, under the name Jinjiang, in 718. The prefecture of Quanzhou was promoted to a superior prefecture under the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911/12) dynasties. After 1911, under the Chinese republic, the superior prefecture reverted to county status under its old name Jinjiang. In 1951, when Quanzhou was established as a city, all of Jinjiang county was merged into it. The Jinjiang county administration was moved and established on the south bank of the Pujiang River, though it was later named Jinjiang city within the Quanzhou urban area.
