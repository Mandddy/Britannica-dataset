Maximinus, original name Gaius Julius Verus Maximinus, also called Maximin or Maximinus Thrax (“The Thracian”)  (born c. 173, Thrace [modern Bulgaria and portions of Turkey]—died 238, near Aquileia [now in Italy]) first soldier who rose through the ranks to become Roman emperor (235–238). His reign marked the beginning of a half century of civil war in the empire. Originally from Thrace, he is said to have been a shepherd before enlisting in the army. There his immense strength attracted the attention of Septimius Severus (emperor 193–211).
Under Severus Alexander (emperor 222–235), Maximinus held high command in the Army of the Rhine, and, when Severus was murdered, he was proclaimed emperor by the Rhine army. Maximinus spent most of his reign fighting invading tribes along the Danube and the Rhine. The numerous milestones displaying his name attest to his energetic reconstructions of the roads in these regions.
