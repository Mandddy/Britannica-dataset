Vajrayogini, also called Vajravarahi,  in Vajrayana (Tantric Buddhism), female embodiment of the cognitive function leading to Buddhahood. Vajrayana emphasizes experience over speculation but uses the terms of speculative philosophical Buddhism in an imaginative way. This practice means that images taken from the ordinary life of the individual become the means to further a deeper understanding of man’s being, which is both action (upaya) and knowledge (prajna), each reinforcing the other.
In iconographical representations, Vajrayogini is usually depicted in a terrifying form, holding in her hands a skull and a dagger, her right leg stretched out, the left one slightly bent (alidha). She is surrounded on all sides by cremation grounds, indicating that the ordinary world has become dead in contrast to the rich world of inner life and its vision of reality without distorting fictions. Although she may be visualized alone, she is usually in union (yab-yum) with Heruka, who, when he is united with Vajrayogini, is known as Hevajra. As such he is very popular in Tibet, particularly with the Bka’-brgyud-pa (a major Buddhist sect), whose tutelary deity he is.
