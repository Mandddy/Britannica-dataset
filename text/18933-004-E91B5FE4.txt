Wright glider of 1902,  biplane glider designed and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright in Dayton, Ohio, during the late summer of 1902. Tested during the autumn of 1902 and again in 1903 at the Kill Devil Hills, four miles south of the village of Kitty Hawk on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the 1902 glider demonstrated that the Wright brothers had solved the key problems blocking the route to heavier-than-air flight.
The glider was based on the Wrights’ experience in 1899 with a kite designed to test their “wing-warping” control system, on two less-successful gliders tested in 1900 and 1901, and on information gathered during the course of wind-tunnel tests conducted in the fall and winter of 1901–02. It featured a forward monoplane elevator, a horizontal surface projecting in front of the wings in order to provide control over pitch and a bit of extra lift. In order to compensate for unequal drag when the wings were warped, a two-surface vertical rudder was fixed at the rear of the glider. The most important modification was made during October 4–6, when, on the basis of flight testing, the Wrights replaced the fixed rudder with a single-surface movable rudder linked to the wing-warping system. This further improved the degree to which the device counteracted the problem of yaw.
