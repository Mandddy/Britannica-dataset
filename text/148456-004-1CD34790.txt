Trojan, also called Trojan horse virus,  a type of malicious computer software (malware) disguised within legitimate or beneficial programs or files. Once installed on a user’s computer system, the trojan allows the malware developer remote access to the host computer, subjecting the host computer to a variety of destructive or undesired activities.
Named for the famed Trojan horse trick that enabled the ancient Greeks to capture the city of Troy, computer trojans can pose a serious threat to unsuspecting computer users. The user first unknowingly installs the trojan application, usually spread through instant-messaging software, e-mail attachments, or Web downloads. Through activation of this “backdoor” access, the computer becomes a “bot,” or zombie, allowing a remote malware user to perform any action that the computer owner could on the infected computer. Thousands of trojans in circulation are used for a variety of malicious purposes: browsing the hard drive to steal data, logging key strokes to acquire personal passwords or account numbers, erasing files, shutting down the computer at random, sending spam from the user’s e-mail account, or deleting the entire hard drive.
