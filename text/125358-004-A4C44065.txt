Henry Knox,  (born July 25, 1750, Boston, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died  October 25, 1806, Thomaston, Maine, U.S.) American general in the American Revolution (1775–83) and first secretary of war under the U.S. Constitution.
Forced by family circumstances to leave school at age nine, Knox worked in a Boston bookstore and by age 21 had acquired his own store. He became active in the colonial militia and in 1775 joined the Continental Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was commissioned a colonel and placed in charge of the artillery. During the winter of 1775–76 General George Washington sent him to Fort Ticonderoga, in New York, to bring back captured British artillery there. In a remarkable feat, Knox brought back artillery totaling 120,000 pounds (55,000 kg), using oxen, horses, and men to transport the guns over snow and ice 300 miles (480 km) to Boston. The weapons were used to drive the British from that besieged city and formed the basis for the Revolutionary artillery.
