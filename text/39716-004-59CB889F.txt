Thomas Parnell,  (born 1679, Dublin—died  1718, Chester, Eng.) Irish poet, essayist, and friend of Alexander Pope, who relied on Parnell’s scholarship in his translation of the Iliad. Parnell’s poetry, written in heroic couplets, was esteemed by Pope for its lyric quality and stylistic ease. Among his best poems are “An Elegy to an Old Beauty” and “Night Piece on Death,” said to have influenced Thomas Gray’s “An Elegy Written in a Country Church Yard.”
Parnell contributed to The Spectator and the Guardian and was a member, with Swift and Gay, of the literary Scriblerus Club. After Parnell’s death, Pope collected his poetry and published it in a volume called Poems on Several Occasions (1722). The work was republished in 1770 with additional poems and a life of Parnell by Oliver Goldsmith.
