De La Soul, American rap group whose debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising (1989), was one of the most influential albums in hip-hop history. The members were Posdnuos (byname of Kelvin Mercer; b. August 17, 1969, New York, New York, U.S.), Trugoy the Dove (byname of David Jolicoeur; b. September 21, 1968, New York), and Pasemaster Mase (byname of Vincent Mason; b. March 24, 1970, New York).
De La Soul was formed in 1988 by three high-school friends in Amityville, New York. Impressed by the trio’s demo, “Plug Tunin’,” “Prince Paul” Houston of the rap group Stetsasonic helped them secure a contract with Tommy Boy Records and produced their landmark debut. Conceptual, densely layered, and replete with quirky interlude skits, 3 Feet High and Rising influenced not only De La Soul’s own self-constructed “family” of alternative rappers (ranging from A Tribe Called Quest to Queen Latifah) but also groups as disparate as Public Enemy (who were inspired by the collage-sampling technique of “Prince Paul”) and gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A. (who incorporated interlude skits). Moreover, prior to the emergence of De La Soul, the primary source for hip-hop samples was the music of James Brown; in the wake of 3 Feet High and Rising, George Clinton’s Parliament-Funkadelic catalog became the mother lode.
