Moses Mendelssohn,  (born Sept. 26, 1729, Dessau, Anhalt [Germany]—died  Jan. 4, 1786, Berlin, Prussia) German-Jewish philosopher, critic, and Bible translator and commentator who greatly contributed to the efforts of Jews to assimilate to the German bourgeoisie.
The son of an impoverished scribe called Menachem Mendel Dessau, he was known in Jewry as Moses Dessau but wrote as Mendelssohn, from the Hebrew ben Mendel (“the Son of Mendel”). His own choice of the German Mendelssohn over the Hebrew equivalent reflected the same acculturation to German life that he sought for other Jews. In 1743 he moved to Berlin, where he studied the thought of the English philosopher John Locke and the German thinkers Gottfried von Leibniz and Christian von Wolff.
