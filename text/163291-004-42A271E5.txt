Ben Okri,  (born March 15, 1959, Minna, Nigeria) Nigerian novelist, short-story writer, and poet who used magic realism to convey the social and political chaos in the country of his birth.
Okri attended Urhobo College in Warri, Nigeria, and the University of Essex in Colchester, England. His first novels, Flowers and Shadows (1980) and The Landscapes Within (1981), employ surrealistic images to depict the corruption and lunacy of a politically scarred country. Two volumes of short stories, Incidents at the Shrine (1986) and Stars of the New Curfew (1988), portray the essential link in Nigerian culture between the physical world and the world of the spirits.
