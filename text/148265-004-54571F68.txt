River Avon, also called Upper Avon or Warwickshire Avon,  river, eastern tributary of the River Severn that rises near Naseby in central England and flows generally southwestward for 96 miles (154 km) through the counties of Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire. The river shares the name Avon (derived from a Celtic word meaning “river”) with several other rivers in Great Britain, including the Avon of Bristol (or Lower Avon) and the Avon of Wiltshire and Hampshire (or East Avon).
It has a total fall of about 500 feet (150 metres). The river valley widens through the Vale of Evesham, especially below Warwickshire, where its fertile soil supports extensive agriculture. The river is known for its scenic beauty especially in the Vale of Evesham, which is flanked by the Cotswold Hills on the south and by the wooded Arden district on the north. The river abounds in coarse fish. It has locks (now decayed) and formerly carried some trade but now is used only by pleasure boats. Important towns along the river include Rugby, Royal Leamington Spa, Warwick, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Evesham. The River Avon has literary associations with William Shakespeare, who was born and died at Stratford.
