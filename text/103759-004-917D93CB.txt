Sacha Baron Cohen, in full Sacha Noam Baron Cohen  (born October 13, 1971, London, England) British actor and comedian best known for his politically incorrect social satire.
Baron Cohen was born into a devout Jewish family, and he studied history at the University of Cambridge. After deciding to pursue a career in entertainment, in 1998 he joined the television comedy series The 11 O’Clock Show, for which he created the character Ali G, a “hip-hop journalist” who was aggressively stupid. With his over-the-top attire—a brightly coloured tracksuit, tinted sunglasses, and designer skullcap—mangled English, and outlandish questions, Ali G interviewed unsuspecting actual politicians and celebrities and in the process revealed their prejudices and ignorance. His phenomenal popularity led to Da Ali G Show in 2000. Baron Cohen soon introduced two other clueless characters: Borat, a racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist Kazakh reporter, and Brüno, a gay Austrian fashion reporter. In 2001 both the show and Baron Cohen earned British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards. After making his film debut in Ali G Indahouse (2002), Baron Cohen sought new unwitting subjects, and in 2003–04 Da Ali G Show aired in the United States on the cable channel HBO.
