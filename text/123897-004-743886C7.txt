NEC Corporation, major Japanese multinational corporation, producer of telecommunications equipment and related software and services. Headquarters are in Tokyo.
Nippon Electric Company, Ltd. (NEC; officially NEC Corporation in 1983), was founded in 1899 with funding from the Western Electric Company of the United States. The Japanese partner in this new venture was Iwadare Kunihiko, an expert in telegraphic systems who had worked for 10 years in the United States under the American inventor Thomas Alva Edison. NEC was the first Japanese joint venture with a foreign company, and it paved the way for Western Electric to export its telephone equipment to the Japanese government. As Western Electric gradually gained confidence in the integrity of Japanâ€™s system of administering patents, it offered technical support that eventually enabled NEC to manufacture, rather than merely assemble, telephone equipment.
