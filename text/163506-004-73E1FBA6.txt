Paul Thomas Anderson, also called P.T. Anderson  (born June 26, 1970, Studio City, California, U.S.) American screenwriter and director whose character-driven films, set mostly in the American West, were recognized for their ambitious and engaging storytelling.
Anderson briefly attended film school at New York University but dropped out to pursue a screenwriting and directing career. His first feature film as a writer-director was Coffee and Cigarettes (1993). Hard Eight (1996), a modern film noir, followed. It included performances by Philip Baker Hall, John C. Reilly, and Philip Seymour Hoffman—all gifted character actors who would be recurring presences in Anderson’s films. Although Hard Eight was critically praised, Anderson’s breakout effort was Boogie Nights (1997). Starring Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Mark Wahlberg—as well as benefitting from scene-stealing performances by Hall, Reilly, and Hoffman—Boogie Nights traces the rise, fall, and resurgence of an adult film star. The story earned Anderson his first Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.
