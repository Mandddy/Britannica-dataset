Brocket,  any of several small deer constituting the genus Mazama of the family Cervidae (order Artiodactyla), and found from Mexico to South America. Timid browsers, brockets inhabit wooded areas and generally live alone or in pairs. There are about four species, among them the brown brocket (M. gouazoubira) and the red brocket (M. americana). Brockets are stout-bodied deer with arched backs and short tails, standing 43–69 cm (17–27 inches) high at the shoulder. The shade of the brown coat depends on the species. Males have short, unbranched antlers.
