Caeneus, in Greek mythology, the son of Elatus, a Lapith from the mountains of Thessaly in what is now northern Greece. At the marriage of Pirithous, king of the Lapiths, the Centaurs (creatures part man and part horse), who were guests, attacked the bride and other women. Caeneus joined in the ensuing battle and, because of his invulnerable body, killed five Centaurs. In desperation the other Centaurs combined against him, piling huge pine trees upon him until the accumulated weight forced him underground, never to appear again. This attack on Caeneus became a favourite theme of Greek art. Ovid (Metamorphoses, Book XII) explained that Caeneus was originally a girl, Caenis, who yielded to the sea god Poseidon and received as a reward the male sex and invulnerability.
