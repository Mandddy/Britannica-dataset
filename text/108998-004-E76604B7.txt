Rick Rubin, in full Frederick Jay Rubin  (born March 10, 1963, Long Island, N.Y., U.S.) American record producer whose light touch and keen ear made him one of the most sought-after producers in popular music.
Rubin grew up listening to heavy metal and early punk, and he frequently took the train into Manhattan from his Long Island home to see New York punk pioneers the Ramones. While a student at New York University, he became interested in rap and immersed himself in the local scene. In 1983 he produced his first single, “It’s Yours,” by T La Rock and Jazzy Jay. Its success as a dance track in local nightclubs inspired him to create his own label, Def Jam Records. After hearing “It’s Yours,” Russell Simmons, who was already a rising star in the hip-hop scene, joined Rubin at Def Jam. The two, based in Rubin’s dormitory room, collected demo tapes from aspiring rappers and disc jockeys. In 1984 they had their first hit with LL Cool J’s “I Need a Beat,” a single that sold 100,000 copies. Rubin had created Def Jam to fill a niche that the mainstream recording industry had ignored, but the major labels took notice when its sales topped 300,000 albums in 1985. Columbia Records placed Rubin and Simmons under contract, and Def Jam’s roster expanded to include the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, and Run-D.M.C. (a group that included Simmons’s brother Joseph).
