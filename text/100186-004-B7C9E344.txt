Northwestern’s undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs are among the most highly regarded in the United States. Total enrollment is approximately 21,000.
The university was founded in 1851 by a group of businessmen and professionals, led by physician John Evans. It was created to serve the area of the Northwest Territory—an area that now includes the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin and part of Minnesota. Instruction began in 1855, and women were first admitted in 1869. When the university merged with the Evanston College for Ladies in 1873, educator and reformer Frances Willard became its first dean of women.
