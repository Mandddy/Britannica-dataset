Charles Loring Brace,  (born June 19, 1826, Litchfield, Conn., U.S.—died  Aug. 11, 1890, Campfer, Switz.) American reformer and pioneer social-welfare worker, a founder and for 37 years executive secretary of the Children’s Aid Society of New York City.
The descendant of a Hartford family long prominent in religious and political life, Brace was educated at Yale University and at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Asked to become the head of “a mission to children” in 1853, he spent the remainder of his life in the Children’s Aid Society. In 1872 he wrote an unconsciously autobiographical account of it as The Dangerous Classes of New York, and Twenty Years’ Work Among Them, which established him as a world authority. At his death a leading sociologist estimated that Brace’s influence had aided more than 300,000 children.
