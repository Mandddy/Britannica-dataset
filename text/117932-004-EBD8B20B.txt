City University of New York, The, system of higher education institutions in New York, New York, U.S. It was created in 1961 to combine New York City’s municipally supported colleges (now numbering 21, including the CUNY Baccalaureate Program). The university includes the Graduate School and University Center, New York’s four original liberal arts colleges (City College of New York [CCNY], Hunter College, Brooklyn College, and Queens College), six other four-year colleges, a four-year technical college, a law school, and six two-year community colleges; in addition, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine is affiliated with CUNY. The four-year institutions are largely autonomous. An open-admissions policy inaugurated in 1970 makes all New York City residents who earn high school diplomas eligible for admission to a CUNY institution.
The oldest of the CUNY colleges is the City College of New York, founded as the all-male Free Academy in 1847 by the New York City Board of Education, under the auspices of politician and diplomat Townsend Harris. It was chartered as a college in 1866. During the first half of the 20th century many of the city’s civic and business leaders were students there, as were such prominent New York intellectuals as Sidney Hook and Irving Kristol. Women were first admitted to graduate programs in 1930, and the college was completely coeducational by 1951.
