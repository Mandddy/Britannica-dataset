Protoceratops (genus Protoceratops), ceratopsian dinosaur found as fossils in the Gobi Desert from 80-million-year-old deposits of the Late Cretaceous Period. Protoceratops was a predecessor of the more familiar horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops. Like other ceratopsians, it had a rostral bone on the upper beak and a small frill around the neck, but Protoceratops lacked the large nose and eye horns of more derived ceratopsians.
Protoceratops evolved from small bipedal ceratopsians such as Psittacosaurus, but Protoceratops was larger and moved about on all four limbs. The hind limbs, however, were more strongly developed than the forelimbs (as expected in an animal that evolved from bipedal ancestors), which gave the back a pronounced arch. Although small for a ceratopsian, Protoceratops was still a relatively large animal. Adults were about 1.8 metres (6 feet) long and would have weighed about 180 kg (400 pounds). The skull was very long, about one-fifth the total body length. Bones in the skull grew backward into a perforated frill. The jaws were beaklike, and teeth were present in both the upper and lower jaws. An area on top of the snout just in front of the eyes may mark the position of a small hornlike structure in adults.
