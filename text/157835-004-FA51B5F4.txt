Jennifer Lopez, in full Jennifer Lynn Lopez, byname J.Lo  (born July 24, 1969, Bronx, New York, U.S.) American actress and musician who began appearing in films in the late 1980s and quickly became one of the highest-paid Latina actresses in the history of Hollywood. She later found crossover success in the music industry with a series of pop albums.
Lopez, who was born into a family of Puerto Rican descent, took dance lessons throughout her childhood and from an early age had aspirations of fame. She performed internationally in stage musicals, and at age 16 she made her film debut with a small role in My Little Girl (1986). Her television break came in 1990 when she was cast as one of the “Fly Girls,” dancers who appeared on the comedy show In Living Color. After she left the show, she turned her focus to acting, first in several short-lived television series and then in movie roles. Film success came quickly, and by the mid-1990s she was appearing with such notable actors as Robin Williams (Jack, 1996) and Jack Nicholson (Blood and Wine, 1997). Lopez still remained somewhat in the periphery of the public vision, however, until she landed the lead role in Selena (1997), a biopic of the murdered Tejana singer. She went on to star in a number of thrillers and action dramas, including Anaconda (1997), U Turn (1997), Out of Sight (1998), and The Cell (2000), and she gained widespread praise for The Wedding Planner (2001), her successful first attempt at romantic comedy. That release was quickly followed by the romantic drama Angel Eyes in the middle of the year.
