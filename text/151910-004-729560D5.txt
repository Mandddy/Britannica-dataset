Conger eel, any of about 100 species of marine eels of the family Congridae (order Anguilliformes). Congers are scaleless eels with large heads, large gill slits, wide mouths, and strong teeth. They are usually grayish to blackish, with paler bellies and black-edged fins. Carnivorous fish found in all oceans, sometimes in deep water, conger eels may grow to a length of about 1.8 metres (6 feet). Many species, such as the European conger (Conger conger), are valued as food. The American conger, or sea eel (C. oceanicus), is a fierce game fish.
