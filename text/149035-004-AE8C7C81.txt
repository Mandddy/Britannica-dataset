Eli Wallach, in full Eli Herschel Wallach  (born December 7, 1915, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died June 24, 2014, New York City) American character actor of great versatility who was perhaps best known for his film appearances in westerns in the 1960s.
Wallach grew up in a Yiddish-speaking household in Brooklyn, where his father owned a candy store. He attended the University of Texas in Austin, and while there he performed onstage and learned to ride horses, a talent that would come into play in his later gunslinger roles. In 1938 he received a master’s degree in education from New York’s City College. Wallach served in the U.S. Army during World War II, working as a medical administrator in France and North Africa. On his return to New York, he was among the earliest groups of students at the famed Actors Studio, where he studied Method acting under Lee Strasberg.
