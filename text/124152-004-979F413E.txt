Polyporales, large order of pore fungi within the phylum Basidiomycota (kingdom Fungi). The 2,300 known species have conspicuous sporophores (fruiting bodies), sometimes mushroomlike, the spore-bearing layer (hymenium) appearing either tube-shaped, gill-like, rough, smooth, or convoluted. Many species are found on the ground or on decaying wood. Some species are edible; others cause diseases of trees.
The order includes the shelf, or bracket, fungi (Polyporaceae), which produce a shelflike fruiting structure on many trees. They cause decay of birch and other hardwoods and of structural timbers (certain Poria species); conifer rot, heart rot, and root rot of rubber plants (Fomes); wood decay and root rot of cacao, coffee, rubber, and other trees (Ganoderma); and diseases of birch and conifers (Polyporus). The white undersurface of artistâ€™s fungus (Fomes applanatus, or Ganoderma applanatum), which darkens when cut, has been used for etching.
