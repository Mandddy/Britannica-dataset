Josephine Preston Peabody,  (born May 30, 1874, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died Dec. 4, 1922, Cambridge, Mass.) American writer of verse dramas and of poetry that ranged from precise, ethereal verse to works of social concern.
Peabody grew up in Brooklyn until 1884, when the death of her father and the consequent poverty of her family forced them to move to the home of her maternal grandmother in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Peabody had absorbed her parents’ love of literature and the theatre, and she read and wrote constantly. Her first published work was a poem that appeared in The Woman’s Journal in 1888, when she was 14 years old. Her formal schooling nearly ended with three years at the Girls’ Latin School in Boston (1889–92), but, after poems of hers had been accepted by the Atlantic Monthly and Scribner’s Magazine in 1894, Peabody was enabled by a patron to attend Radcliffe College in Cambridge as a special student (1894–96). Her first volume of verse, The Wayfarers (1898), was followed by Fortune and Men’s Eyes (1900), a one-act play built on Shakespeare’s sonnets, and Marlowe (1901), a verse play on Christopher Marlowe. From 1901 to 1903 she lectured on poetry and literature at Wellesley (Massachusetts) College.
