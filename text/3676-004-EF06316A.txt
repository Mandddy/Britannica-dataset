Procyonid (family Procyonidae), any of a group of tree-climbing mammals comprising raccoons, coatis, olingos, the New World ringtail, the cacomistle, and the kinkajou. Though the 18 species are classified as carnivores, procyonids are actually omnivorous and are closely related to bears (family Ursidae). Indeed, both the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and the lesser, or red, panda (Ailurus fulgens) have been grouped in the past as procyonids; however, the giant panda is actually a bear, and the lesser panda is the sole member of family Ailuridae. Procyonids mostly inhabit Central America, and only the North American raccoon is widely distributed north of the tropics. The raccoon and some other procyonids are sometimes kept as pets.
Procyonids are relatively small carnivores that usually weigh 1–12 kg (2–26 pounds), depending on the species. Body lengths range from 30–70 cm (12–28 inches), and tails range from 20 to 70 cm. Coats are generally brown, and many species have facial markings and a dark-banded tail. The eyes are large and the ears rounded. The tail can be prehensile, as in the kinkajou (Potos flavus), or semiprehensile and used for balance, as in the coatis (genera Nasua and Nasuella). The feet have five digits and are void of fur on the soles. Long fingers allow great dexterity; all species are good climbers, and at least one species, the kinkajou, is arboreal. The claws are short, curved, and either nonretractile or semiretractile. Like bears, procyonids walk on the soles of the feet (plantigrade locomotion), leaving clear imprints of the paw pad and all digits. Procyonids have 40 teeth, with long canine teeth and small, sharp premolars; the molars are broad. This dentition is indicative of an omnivorous diet that includes animal flesh, invertebrates, fruits, and grains. Kinkajous are mostly fruit eaters (frugivorous), whereas other species are opportunistic and consume whatever is available.
