Jaromir Jagr,  (born February 15, 1972, Kladno, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]) Czech professional ice hockey player who was one of the most prolific-point scorers in National Hockey League (NHL) history. Jagr won two Stanley Cup championships with the Pittsburgh Penguins (1991 and 1992).
Jagr demonstrated his talent for hockey early in life and played professionally in his native Czechoslovakia at age 15. He became the first Czechoslovakian to declare for the NHL draft with his government’s blessing, and he was chosen by the Penguins as the fifth overall selection in 1990. Jagr made an immediate impact on the Penguins, scoring 27 goals in the 1990–91 season while contributing to the franchise’s first Stanley Cup victory. Jagr was named to the NHL All-Star team during the 1991–92 season (the first of his nine career All-Star selections), and the Penguins repeated as NHL champions that year. When his star teammate Mario Lemieux missed the 1994–95 season, Jagr stepped into the Penguins’ offensive void and led the league in scoring. He continued to play a prominent role in the team’s offense when Lemieux returned the following season, and Jagr went on to take the league scoring title in four consecutive seasons (1997–98 to 2000–01).
