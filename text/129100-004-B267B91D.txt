Pietro Bernini,  (born 1562, Tuscany [Italy]—died 1629, Rome) Italian late Mannerist sculptor who was invited to Rome in 1605/06 to work for Pope Paul V (1605–21) on the decorations of the Paolina (Borghese) Chapel in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he carved the coronation of Clement VIII (1612–13), as well as the marble relief Assumption of the Virgin (1607–10) in the baptistery. For the Barberini Chapel in Sant’Andrea della Valle, he carved St. John the Baptist (1616).
Although he was trained in Tuscany, Bernini worked in Naples (1584) until he was called to Rome. His son, the great Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, was born in Naples. In that city, Pietro made three statues—Charity in the Church of Monte di Pietà, St. Matthew in the Church of Gesù Nuovo, and the Virgin in the National Museum of San Martino (reworked by Cosimo Fanzago). He also carved the Medina Fountain in San Martino, and the Barcaccia (1627–29), a fountain in the form of a leaking boat in the Piazza di Spagna, Rome, is believed to be his work, though some have attributed it to Gian Lorenzo. Gian Lorenzo was taught marble cutting by Pietro, and the father’s patrons, the powerful Borghese and Barberini families, offered the younger man early commissions.
