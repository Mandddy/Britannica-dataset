William Cullen,  (born April 15, 1710, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scot.—died Feb. 5, 1790, Kirknewton, near Edinburgh) Scottish physician and professor of medicine, best known for his innovative teaching methods.
Cullen received his early education at Hamilton Grammar School, in the town where he was born and where his father, a lawyer, was employed by the duke of Hamilton. In 1726 Cullen went to the University of Glasgow, where he became a student of British surgeon John Paisley. In 1729 Cullen was hired to serve as ship’s surgeon aboard a merchant vessel sailing from London to the West Indies. Upon his return to London, he took a post as an assistant to a local apothecary. Cullen remained in London until 1732, when he ventured home to Scotland and established his own medical practice near the village of Shotts in Lanarkshire (now North Lanarkshire). In 1734 he attended the new medical school at Edinburgh, returning to his private practice in Hamilton two years later. He spent eight years in private clinical practice, attending without fee those too poor to afford his services. In 1740 he received an M.D. from Glasgow, and several years later he obtained permission to deliver a series of independent lectures on chemistry and medicine, the first to be offered in Great Britain. He was elected to the chair of medicine at Glasgow in 1751. In 1755 Cullen returned to the University of Edinburgh, where he was later appointed to the chair of the institutes (theory) of medicine and eventually became sole professor of medicine, the position he held until shortly before his death. In 1777 Cullen was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London.
