House on Haunted Hill, American horror film, released in 1959, that was produced and directed by popular B-filmmaker William Castle, who was known for his theatre gimmicks. The movie later developed a cult following.
Vincent Price played Frederick Loren, an eccentric millionaire who rents a reportedly haunted mansion for one night under the pretense of hosting a party for his wife, Annabelle, whom he believes to be after his fortune. He explains to his guests that any among them who survives in the house for one night—during which all communication with the outside world will be cut—will receive a prize of $10,000. Each is presented with a pistol in order to fend off the house’s ghosts. Annabelle warns the guests that she fears Loren means her harm and meanwhile plots with her lover, Dr. Trent, to trick one of the guests into shooting him. Assorted terrors haunt the guests at every turn, including ghosts, a severed head, and Annabelle’s (later revealed to be faked) death. Though her plot finally comes to fruition and Loren is “shot” by one of the guests, the gun proves to have been loaded with blanks. Trent attempts to dispose of what he thinks is Loren’s corpse, but he is pushed into a vat of acid by Loren. Loren later uses Trent’s skeleton to scare Annabelle into the acid as well.
