Josh Groban, in full Joshua Winslow Groban  (born February 27, 1981, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) American popular singer, recognized for his novel blending of contemporary and classical styles.
Groban did not study voice seriously until his teens, when he became active in musical theatre at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. In late 1998 he was introduced to Grammy-winning producer David Foster, who hired Groban to sing at a number of events, and Groban soon received a recording contract from Warner Brothers. Concerned that Groban’s singing—often in Italian—defied easy categorization, his promoters organized a series of performances on TV news and talk shows, as well as two guest spots on the popular series Ally McBeal. The appearances, which capitalized on the singer’s onstage magnetism, fueled sales of his first album, Josh Groban (2001). Produced by Foster, the album blended pop with classical songs, showcasing Groban’s rich baritone voice and romantic sensibility. His continuing performances at high-profile media events, including the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, extended Groban’s international appeal.
