The Mummy, American horror film, released in 1932, that is considered a classic of the genre, especially known for Boris Karloff’s performance in the title role.
Karloff played an ancient Egyptian priest called Im-Ho-Tep who was buried alive. After nearly 4,000 years, however, he is brought back to life when archaeologists discover his mummy and read a life-giving spell from a scroll in his coffin. As the contemporary Egyptian Ardeth Bey, he embarks on a quest to reunite with his ancient love. Years later he succeeds in resurrecting her, in the form of Helen Grosvenor (played by Zita Johann). However, Bey’s attempts to transform her into a living mummy fail when the goddess Isis answers Helen’s calls for help and kills Bey.
