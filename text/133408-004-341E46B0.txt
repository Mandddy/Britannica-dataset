Richard Neville, 16th earl of Warwick, byname the Kingmaker  (born November 22, 1428—died April 14, 1471, Barnet, Hertfordshire, England) English nobleman called, since the 16th century, “the Kingmaker,” in reference to his role as arbiter of royal power during the first half of the Wars of the Roses (1455–85) between the houses of Lancaster and York. He obtained the crown for the Yorkist king Edward IV in 1461 and later restored to power (1470–71) the deposed Lancastrian monarch Henry VI.
The son of Richard Neville, 5th earl of Salisbury (d. 1460), he became, through marriage, earl of Warwick in 1449 and thereby acquired vast estates throughout England. In 1453 Warwick and his father allied with Richard, duke of York, who was struggling to wrest power from the Lancastrian Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset, chief minister to the ineffectual king Henry VI. The two sides eventually took up arms, and, at the Battle of St. Albans, Hertfordshire, in May 1455, Warwick’s flank attack won a swift victory for the Yorkists. As his reward Warwick was appointed captain of Calais, an English possession on the coast of France. From Calais he crossed to England in 1460 and defeated and captured Henry VI at Northampton (July 10). York and Parliament agreed to let Henry keep his crown, probably through the influence of Warwick, who preferred to have a weak king.
