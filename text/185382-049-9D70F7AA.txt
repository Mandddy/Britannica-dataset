Thermal conduction, transfer of energy (heat) arising from temperature differences between adjacent parts of a body.
Thermal conductivity is attributed to the exchange of energy between adjacent molecules and electrons in the conducting medium. The rate of heat flow in a rod of material is proportional to the cross-sectional area of the rod and to the temperature difference between the ends and inversely proportional to the length; that is the rate H equals the ratio of the cross section A of the rod to its length l, multiplied by the temperature difference (T2 − T1) and by the thermal conductivity of the material, designated by the constant k. This empirical relation is expressed as: H = −k(A/l)(T2 − T1). The minus sign arises because heat flows always from higher to lower temperature.
