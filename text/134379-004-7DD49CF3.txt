Mahzor, (
        Hebrew: “cycle”)  also spelled machzor, plural mahzorim, machzorim, mahzors, or machzors,  originally a Jewish prayer book arranged according to liturgical chronology and used throughout the entire year. Though cantors (hazzanim) still use such a book, mahzor has come to mean the festival prayer book—as distinguished from the siddur, the prayer book used on the ordinary Sabbath and on weekdays.
Though the basic structure and prayers of the Ashkenazi (German) and Sephardic (Spanish) rites are essentially the same, the mahzorim of the various rites show considerable variety, principally owing to the adoption of different religious hymns (piyyutim) and liturgical compositions. Piyyutim composed by such celebrated medieval poets as Eleazar Kalir abound in the Ashkenazi mahzor but do not appear in Sephardic festive liturgies, which draw on the compositions of the great Spanish poets. Local ritual differences have given rise to somewhat different mahzorim within both the Ashkenazi and the Sephardic rites.
