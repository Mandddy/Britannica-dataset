Robert C. Seamans, Jr., in full Robert Channing Seamans, Jr.   (born October 30, 1918, Salem, Massachusetts, U.S.—died June 28, 2008, Beverly Farms, Massachusetts) American aeronautical engineer who pioneered in the development of advanced systems of flight control, fire control, and guidance for modern aircraft.
In 1941 Seamans became an instructor of aircraft instrumentation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, while still working on his master’s degree. Under the instruction and guidance of the American engineer C. Stark Draper, he worked on fire-control systems for naval antiaircraft guns. His doctoral work on the problems of control and guidance of high-speed aircraft proved valuable in the development of automatic flight control, automatic tracking equipment, homing systems for guided missiles, and intercontinental ballistic missile control systems.
