Christopher A. Sims, in full Christopher Albert Sims  (born October 21, 1942, Washington, D.C., U.S.) American economist who, with Thomas J. Sargent, was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize for Economics. He and Sargent were honoured for their independent but complementary research on how changes in macroeconomic indicators such as gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, investment, and unemployment causally interact with economic “shocks,” or unexpected events having at least short-term economic consequences (Sims), and with long-term government economic policy (Sargent).
Sims attended Harvard University, receiving a B.A. in mathematics in 1963 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1968. After teaching for three years at Harvard, he joined the economics faculty of the University of Minnesota, where he remained until his appointment in 1990 as Henry Ford II Professor of Economics at Yale University. In 1999 he left Yale for Princeton University, where he was a professor of economics and later Harold H. Helm ’20 Professor of Economics and Banking.
