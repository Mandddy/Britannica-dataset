Charles Montagu, 1st earl of Halifax, also called (1700–14) Baron Halifax Of Halifax   (born April 16, 1661, Horton, Northamptonshire, Eng.—died  May 19, 1715, London) Whig statesman, a financial genius who created several of the key elements of England’s system of public finance.
He was elected to Parliament in 1689 and appointed a lord of the Treasury three years later. By devising a system of guaranteed government loans, Montagu financed British participation in the War of the Grand Alliance with France (1689–97) and initiated the national debt. With another set of loans he established the Bank of England in 1694. Shortly thereafter he became chancellor of the Exchequer and a member of the small group of Whig leaders known as the Junto. Elected to Parliament in 1695, he at once pushed through a controversial scheme of national recoinage. In 1697 he became first lord of the Treasury and leader of the House of Commons. He resigned under pressure from a Tory-dominated Parliament in 1699, and in 1700 he was made Baron Halifax. When George I assumed the crown in 1714, Montagu was appointed first lord of the Treasury and created an earl, but he died (without issue) after only seven months in office.
