Flint glass, also called Crystal, or Lead Crystal,  heavy and durable glass characterized by its brilliance, clarity, and highly refractive quality. Developed by George Ravenscroft in 1675, it ushered in a new style in glassmaking and eventually made England the leading glass producer of the world. Ravenscroft’s experimentation was supported by the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers, a body of English retailers long dissatisfied with the quality of glass from Isola (island) di Murano, Venice.
The first clear crystal Ravenscroft produced, called flint glass because calcined flint was used as a base, decayed after a period of time. This fault was overcome by adding lead oxide to produce lead crystal. (“Flint glass” thus became a synonymous term for lead crystal, though flint is no longer part of its composition.) The Glass Sellers furnished the designs and set exacting standards for the product. Their earliest examples bear the seal of a raven’s head. In time, the adaptation of European traditional styling to the new glass produced a genuine native English style of glassware.
