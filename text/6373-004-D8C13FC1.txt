Carl Becker, in full Carl Lotus Becker  (born September 7, 1873, near Waterloo, Iowa, U.S.—died April 10, 1945, Ithaca, New York) American historian known for his work on early American intellectual history and on the 18th-century Enlightenment.
Becker studied at the University of Wisconsin (B.A., 1896; Ph.D., 1907) and Columbia University. He taught at the University of Kansas, Lawrence, from 1902 to 1916 and at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, from 1917 until he retired in 1941. In The Beginnings of the American People (1915), he elaborated on his doctoral work by advancing the thesis of a dual American Revolution—the first being the struggle for self-government and the second the ideological battle over the form such government should take. In The Eve of the Revolution (1918) and The Declaration of Independence (1922), he further probed the relationship between 18th-century natural-rights philosophy and the American Revolution.
