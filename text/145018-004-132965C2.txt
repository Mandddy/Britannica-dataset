Tuscarawas River, river rising in Summit county, northeastern Ohio, U.S., near Akron and Barberton (there dammed to form the Portage Lakes). It flows south past Massillon, Dover, and New Philadelphia and then west to join the Walhonding River near Coshocton after a course of 125 miles (201 km) to form the Muskingum River. A flood-control dam on the Tuscarawas north of Dover impounds the Beach City Reservoir, and Piedmont, Tappan, Clendening, Leesville, and Atwood lakes are other reservoirs formed by dams on the riverâ€™s tributaries. The name Tuscarawas is derived from the name of the Tuscarora Indian tribe.
