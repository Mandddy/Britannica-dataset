Kjartan Fløgstad, pseudonym K. Villum  (born June 7, 1944, Sauda, Norway) Norwegian poet, novelist, and essayist best known for his novel Dalen Portland (1977; “Portland Valley”; Eng. trans. Dollar Road).
Before he became a successful writer, Fløgstad was a blue-collar worker and a sailor. He remained sympathetic to the working class in his writings, which, as one critic pointed out, were also fantastical and experimental. Not surprisingly, then, some of his deepest affinities were with Latin American writers. He translated the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda in Dikt i utval (1972; “Selected Poems”), as well as various Cuban poets in Dikt frå Cuba (1973; “Poems from Cuba”).
