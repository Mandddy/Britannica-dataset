Jet stream, a region of long, narrow, high-speed winds that typically flow northeastward, eastward, and southeastward in the middle and upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. Jet streams are characterized by wind motions that generate strong vertical shearing action, which is thought to be largely responsible for clear air turbulence. A brief treatment of jet streams follows. For full treatment, see climate: Jet streams.
First discovered by airmen during World War II, the jet streams have speeds of up to 90 metres per second (200 miles per hour) along hundreds of kilometres at their centres, but velocities fall off very sharply both laterally and vertically, so that the high speeds are limited to narrow bands at heights between 6 and 14 km (20,000 and 45,000 feet). The jet stream results from horizontal differences in temperature that exist over a considerable vertical distance through the troposphere. These temperature differences produce a horizontal pressure gradient that drives geostrophic and gradient winds. The greater the horizontal temperature difference, the stronger the jet stream.
