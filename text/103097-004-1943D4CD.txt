Neil Diamond, in full Neil Leslie Diamond  (born January 24, 1941, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) American singer-songwriter. He began his career writing pop songs for other musicians and then launched a solo recording career that spanned more than four decades.
Diamond’s interest in music began at age 16, when he obtained his first guitar. After graduating from high school, Diamond attended New York University with the intention of entering medical school. However, he left college during his final year to take a job as a staff songwriter for the Sunbeam Music Company. His tenure at Sunbeam was short, and he became one of a stable of songwriters who worked out of New York’s famed Brill Building.
