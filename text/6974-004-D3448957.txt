Bullfinch, any of several stocky stout-billed songbirds of the families Fringillidae and Emberizidae (order Passeriformes). Eurasia has six species of the genus Pyrrhula, all boldly marked. The common bullfinch (P. pyrrhula), 15 cm (6 inches) long, is black and white, and the male has a pinkish orange underside. This species, usually found in evergreen groves and hedgerows, has a soft warbling call; it is a popular cage bird. The trumpeter bullfinch (Rhodopechys githaginea) of arid localities from the Canary Islands to India is a pale bird washed with pink; it has a blaring buzzy note. Most bullfinches are fringillids; however, Caribbean species, which belong to the genera Melopyrrha and Loxigilla, are classified in the family Emberizidae.
