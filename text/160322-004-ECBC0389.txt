Destroyer, fast naval vessel that has served a variety of functions since the late 19th century, mainly in defense of surface fleets and convoys.
The term destroyer was first used for the 250-ton vessels built in the 1890s to protect battleships from torpedo boats. These torpedo-boat destroyers, as they were called, then became super torpedo boats themselves, so that by World War I they were commonly deployed ahead of the battle fleet to scout for the enemy fleet, beat back its destroyers with cannon fire, and then launch torpedoes against its battleships and cruisers.
