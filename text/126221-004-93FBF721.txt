Taxidermy,  the practice of creating lifelike representations of animals, most commonly birds and mammals, by the use of their prepared skins and various supporting structures. Taxidermy may be traced to the ancient custom of preserving trophies of the hunt, but the principal motive for its development into an art was the growth of interest, especially from the time of the Enlightenment, in natural history and the consequent appearance of both private collections and exhibits in public museums of birds, beasts, and curiosities. By the early 18th century, chemical means of preserving skins, hair, and feathers from decay and insects made possible the first crude attempts to re-create the appearance of live animals by stuffing the sewed-up skins with hay or straw. The rapid improvement of methods of preparing skins and the invention of new techniques of mounting them were followed closely by a trend toward realistic display—the animals were shown in positions, often suggesting great activity, observed in nature, and, by the addition of real or artificial vegetation, painted backgrounds, etc., lifelike scenes and even whole habitats were simulated. In the 19th century, taxidermy became firmly established as a museum art in the work of such commercial houses as Maison Verreaux in Paris, founded by a naturalist and explorer, which furnished great numbers of exhibits to museums. The influence of Verreaux was superseded by that of Ward’s Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, N.Y., where a group of young enthusiasts, notably Carl Akeley, devoted themselves to the perfection of taxidermic methods. The techniques for constructing and sculpting anatomically correct manikins of clay and plaster that were developed at Ward’s remain the basis of modern taxidermy; subsequent developments concerned mainly the treatment of reptiles, insects, and soft-bodied creatures and the introduction of such new materials as celluloid and other plastics.
