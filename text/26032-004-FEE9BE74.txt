Knud Rasmussen, in full Knud Johan Victor Rasmussen  (born June 7, 1879, Jakobshavn, Greenland—died Dec. 21, 1933, Gentofte, Den.) Danish-Eskimo explorer and ethnologist who, in the course of completing the longest dog-sledge journey to that time, across the American Arctic, made a scientific study of virtually every Eskimo tribe in that vast region.
Partly of Eskimo descent himself, and equipped with a thorough mastery of the Eskimo language, Rasmussen wintered among the most northerly tribe in the world, the Polar Eskimo of northwestern Greenland (1902–04). He studied the possibility of introducing reindeer husbandry to western Greenland (1905), spent the next two years again among the Polar Eskimo, and founded a permanent station at Thule, Greenland, in 1910. Its purpose was to provide a trading centre for the population and a base for expeditions. With three companions he crossed the Greenland ice sheet, in 1912, from Thule to the northeast coast. His expedition of 1916–18 surveyed the north coast of Greenland. In 1919 he went to Angmagssalik in eastern Greenland to collect Eskimo tales.
