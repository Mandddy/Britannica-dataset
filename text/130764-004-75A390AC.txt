Teleprinter, also called Teletypewriter,  any of various telegraphic instruments that transmit and receive printed messages and data via telephone cables or radio relay systems. Teleprinters became the most common telegraphic instruments shortly after entering commercial use in the 1920s. They were used by operators in local telegraph offices and switching centres, by press associations and other private networks, and by subscribers to international telegraphic message services such as telex Since the advent of low-cost, high-speed data transmission in the 1980s, teleprinters have steadily given way to computer terminals and facsimile (fax) machines.
Printing telegraphs of various types were designed from the beginning of electric telegraphy in the mid-19th century. The few successful designs all required an elaborate set-up procedure as well as skilled operators who knew the telegraphic codes employed. Teleprinters opened telegraphy to broader use essentially by adapting it to the typewriter, which was then becoming a standard business machine and which could be operated by less-skilled personnel. Early teletypewriters were developed around the turn of the 20th century by Donald Murray in Britain, by the Morkrum Company in the United States, and by Siemens &amp; Halske AG in Germany. In 1924 the Teletype Corporation introduced a series of teletypewriters which were so popular that the name Teletype became synonymous with teleprinters in the United States.
