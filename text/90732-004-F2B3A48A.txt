His Girl Friday, American screwball comedy film, released in 1940, that was director Howard Hawks’s innovative remake of The Front Page (1931). The lightning-fast repartee and prickly courtship of the film’s two leads made it a classic in the genre.
Cary Grant played a self-centred newsman determined to keep his ex-wife and former star reporter (played by Rosalind Russell) on staff to help get the scoop on an escaped murderer. At the same time, he tries to prevent her marriage to the handsome but boring Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy).
