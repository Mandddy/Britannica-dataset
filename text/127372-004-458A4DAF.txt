Caiman, also spelled cayman ,  any of several species of Central and South American reptiles that are related to alligators and are usually placed with them in the family Alligatoridae. Caimans, like all other members of order Crocodylia (or Crocodilia), are amphibious carnivores. They live along the edges of rivers and other bodies of water, and they reproduce by means of hard-shelled eggs laid in nests built and guarded by the female.
Caimans are placed in three genera: Caiman includes the broad-snouted (C. latirostris) and spectacled (C. crocodilus) caimans; Melanosuchus, the black caiman (M. niger); and Paleosuchus, two species (P. trigonatus and P. palpebrosus) known as the smooth-fronted caimans.
