Sir Osbert Lancaster,  (born Aug. 4, 1908, London, Eng.—died July 27, 1986, London) English cartoonist, stage designer, and writer, best-known for his suave cartoons that appeared from 1939 in the Daily Express (London), which gently satirized the English upper class, especially its response to social change. He was also noted for his architectural writings and personal memoirs.
Lancaster took his B.A. degree at Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1930. After an unsuccessful attempt at studying for the bar, he entered the Slade School of Art, University of London, receiving certificates in painting and stage design. Later he became a regular contributor to Architectural Review, illustrating his column with line drawings. His first book was a collection of these drawings: Progress at Pelvis Bay (1936), a biting architectural profile of an English seaside village from its most remote past to its “planned” future. His subsequent books were Pillar to Post, a witty dissection of English architectural history (1938), and Homes, Sweet Homes (1939), in a similar vein and concerned with English interior decoration. These works were later combined, with additional material on American architecture and design, in Here, of All Places (1958).
