William Frederick Poole,  (born Dec. 24, 1821, Salem, Mass., U.S.—died  March 1, 1894, Evanston, Ill.) American bibliographer and library administrator whose indexing of periodicals became authoritative.
As a student at Yale University, Poole learned the principles of indexing from John Edmands (1820–1915), afterward librarian of the Philadelphia Mercantile Library, whom Poole succeeded as librarian of a college literary society. While still in college, Poole prepared An Alphabetical Index to Subjects Treated in the Reviews and Other Periodicals, to Which No Indexes Have Been Published (1848), which was revised and enlarged as Poole’s Index to Periodical Literature (1887–1908).
