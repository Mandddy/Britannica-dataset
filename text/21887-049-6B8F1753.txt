Transamazonian highway, Portuguese Rodovia Transamazônica,  system of paved and unpaved roads in Brazil that is designed to facilitate settlement and exploitation of the vast underpopulated Amazon River Basin. The system consists of several major parts. A 3,400-mile (5,100-kilometre) east-west segment extends from Recife, on the Atlantic coast, through Marabá, Itaituba, Humaitá, and Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul, on the Peruvian border. The two major north-south links are Rio de Janeiro–Brasília–Porto Franco–Belém and São Paulo–Cuiabá–Santarém, further west. An additional road links Cuiabá northwestward with the Transamazonian highway at Humaitá and continues northward to Manaus and beyond to the partially completed Northern Perimeter Highway.
The rapid pace of construction of this road system has raised serious questions about the preservation of the Amazon Rainforest’s fragile ecology and of the region’s aboriginal Indian population in the face of the growing numbers of Brazilian farmers, loggers, and miners who now have access to the Amazon Basin. None of these fears, however, was expected to alter Brazil’s determination to provide an outlet for its burgeoning population and a means of exploiting the enormous, so far almost untapped, mineral wealth of the basin, which includes bauxite, copper, iron, manganese, petroleum, and tin.
