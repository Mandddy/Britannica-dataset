Rigging,  the sails, masts, booms, yards, stays, and lines of a sailing vessel, or its cordage only.
The basis of all rigging is the mast, which may be composed of one or many pieces of wood or metal. The mast is supported by stays and shrouds that are known as the standing rigging because they are made fast; the shrouds also serve as ladders to permit the crew to climb aloft. The masts and forestays support all the sails. The ropes by which the yards, on square riggers, the booms of fore-and-aft sails, and sails, such as jibs, are manipulated for trimming to the wind and for making or shortening sail are known as the running rigging. The running rigging is subdivided into the lifts, jeers, and halyards (haulyards), by which the sails are raised and lowered, and the tacks and sheets, which hold down the lower corners of the sails. The history of the development of rigging over the centuries is obscure, but the combination of square and fore-and-aft sails in the full-rigged ship created a highly complex, interdependent set of components.
