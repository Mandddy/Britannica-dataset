Sophie von La Roche, née Sophie Gutermann  (born Dec. 6, 1731, Kaufbeuern, Bavaria [Germany]—died  Feb. 18, 1807, Offenbach, Hesse) German writer whose first and most important work, Geschichte des Fräuleins von Sternheim (1771; History of Lady Sophia Sternheim), was the first German novel written by a woman and is considered to be among the best works from the period in which English novels, particularly those of Samuel Richardson, had great influence on many German writers.
She was engaged to her close friend and cousin, the well-known writer Christoph Martin Wieland, but the betrothal was dissolved, and in 1754 she married G.M. Franck von La Roche. She was to become the grandmother of Bettina von Arnim and Clemens Brentano, both associated with the Romantic movement. From 1771 she maintained a literary salon in Ehrenbreitstein to which the young J.W. von Goethe belonged. In that year Wieland edited and published her first novel. Both its insistent didacticism and its partially epistolary form follow English models, but it also is related to the new phase of fiction introduced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s novel La Nouvelle Héloïse; in La Roche’s novel, passion begins to take a place beside rational morality and virtue. Fräulein von Sternheim’s melancholy moods and the “confessional” aspect lent to the novel by its letter form won it fame. This, like all La Roche’s works, is imbued with the rational spirit of the Enlightenment and shows her interest in economic and social problems, including women’s education.
