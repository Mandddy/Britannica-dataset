Giulio Natta,  (born Feb. 26, 1903, Imperia, near Genoa, Italy—died  May 2, 1979, Bergamo) Italian chemist who contributed to the development of high polymers useful in the manufacture of films, plastics, fibres, and synthetic rubber. Along with Karl Ziegler of Germany, he was honoured in 1963 with the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the development of Ziegler-Natta catalysts.
Natta took his doctorate in chemical engineering at Milan Polytechnic (1924) and held chairs in chemistry at the universities of Pavia, Rome, and Turin before returning to the Polytechnic as professor and research director of industrial chemistry (1938). His earlier work formed the basis of modern industrial syntheses of methanol, formaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and succinic acid. In 1953 he began intensive study of macromolecules. Using Ziegler’s catalysts, he experimented with the polymerization of propylene and obtained polypropylenes of highly regular molecular structure. The properties—high strength, high melting points—of these polymers soon proved very commercially important.
