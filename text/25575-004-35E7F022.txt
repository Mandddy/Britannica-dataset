Andries Pretorius, in full Andries Wilhelmus Jacobus Pretorius   (born Nov. 27, 1798, near Graaff-Reinet, Cape Colony [now in South Africa]—died  July 23, 1853, Magaliesberg, Transvaal [now in South Africa]) Boer leader in the Great Trek from British-dominated Cape Colony, the dominant military and political figure in Natal and later in the Transvaal, and one of the major agents of white conquest in Southern Africa.
After taking part in several frontier wars in the Cape Colony, Pretorius went on an exploratory trek in 1837; he left his farm permanently to settle in Natal the following year. When Dingane’s Zulus, seeking to keep the white invaders out, murdered trek leader Piet Retief and his party and counterattacked against the settlers in Natal, Pretorius raised a commando force of 500 and defeated 10,000 Zulus at the Battle of Blood (Ncome) River (Dec. 16,1838), killing 3,000 with hardly any loss of his own men. Dingane’s brother Mpande then organized a revolt against him and allied with Pretorius. Their combined forces defeated Dingane at the Battle of Maqongqo (near the present town of Magudu) in January 1840, putting Mpande on the Zulu throne.
