Winthrop Ames,  (born Nov. 25, 1870, North Easton, Mass., U.S.â€”died  Nov. 3, 1937, Boston) American theatrical producer, manager, director, and occasional playwright known for some of the finest productions of plays in the United States during the first three decades of the 20th century.
Though his interests lay in the theatre, to please his family Ames entered the publishing business for a few years after completing his education in 1896. He traveled to Europe in 1907, however, to study the management of more than 60 opera and theatrical companies. He returned to Boston and became known for his experiments with the stock company there. His innovative approach to stagecraft reflected his study of the new European art theatre movement, but the company had little financial success.
