Dan, also called Gio or Yakuba,  an ethnolinguistic grouping of people inhabiting the mountainous west-central Côte d’Ivoire and adjacent areas of Liberia. The Dan belong to the Southern branch of the Mande linguistic subgroup of the Niger-Congo language family. They originated somewhere to the west or northwest of their present lands, perhaps among the Malinke (Mandingo). The Dan are closely related to the Gere (also spelled Ngere, or Guere) to the south.
The roughly 1,500–4,000-foot- (450–1,200-metre-) high Dang (Dans) and Toura mountains are hot and humid and covered with lush vegetation. The area is isolated, and even the most general lines of history are unknown. The Dan and their neighbours are said to have a history of warfare, but it has been debated whether they actually fought the battles attributed to them or whether these are part of oral tradition and a cultural model. The isolation of the area probably served to accentuate myths of bellicose, “primitive” mountain people best avoided because dangerous. Christian proselytism proved difficult as well, as the Dan have preferred to maintain their own religious beliefs.
