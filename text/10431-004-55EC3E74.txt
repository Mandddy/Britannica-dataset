William S. Knudsen, original name Signius Wilhelm Poul Knudsen   (born March 25, 1879, Copenhagen—died  April 27, 1948, Detroit) Danish-born American industrialist, an effective coordinator of automobile mass production who served as president of General Motors Corporation (1937–40) and directed the government’s massive armaments production program for World War II.
After Knudsen immigrated to the United States in 1900, he worked at a variety of jobs. In 1902 he began working for Keim Mills, a Buffalo bicycle factory, which in 1904 began manufacturing parts for the Ford Motor Company. Ford purchased the factory in 1911, and Knudsen was eventually transferred to Ford’s Detroit plant. In 1914, the year that he became a U.S. citizen, he began supervising the establishment of Ford assembly plants throughout the United States. He directed the firm’s construction of submarine patrol boats and other war matériel for the U.S. Navy during World War I. In 1922, after a falling-out with Henry Ford, he joined the General Motors Corporation; he was appointed president and general manager of the Chevrolet division in 1924 and president of General Motors in 1937.
