Iain Duncan Smith, in full George Iain Duncan Smith   (born April 9, 1954, Edinburgh, Scotland) British politician who served as leader of the Conservative Party (2001–03) and as work and pensions secretary in the cabinet of Prime Minister David Cameron (2010–16).
Duncan Smith, whose father was a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II, was educated privately, and for a period he attended HMS Conway, a merchant navy training school in Wales. In 1975 he entered army training at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and was subsequently commissioned into the Scots Guards; he rose to the rank of captain in 1979. In 1981 he decided that his future lay in civilian life, and he joined the defense electronics company GEC-Marconi as a sales and marketing executive—a role that took him frequently to the United States, where he forged links with Pentagon officials and Republican politicians. In 1982 he married Elizabeth Wynne Fremantle, daughter of the 5th Baron Cottesloe.
