Johnny Mercer, byname of John Herndon Mercer   (born November 18, 1909, Savannah, Georgia, U.S.—died June 25, 1976, Bel Air, California) American lyricist, vocalist, and composer who contributed to many Broadway musical productions and Hollywood films.
Educated in Virginia, Mercer arrived in New York City in the late 1920s and acted in bit parts until his collaboration with Everett Miller on “Out of Breath and Scared to Death of You” was accepted for the revue Garrick Gaieties (1930). Mercer used his wit and Southern background to produce clever lyrics that could be breezy, romantic, or full of local colour. He worked through music publishers until 1934, when he joined Paul Whiteman’s orchestra as master of ceremonies and featured vocalist, continuing meanwhile to write for motion-picture musicals. In 1939 he joined Benny Goodman’s Camel Caravan radio show.
