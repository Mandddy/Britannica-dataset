Geraldine Page, in full Geraldine Sue Page  (born Nov. 22, 1924, Kirksville, Mo., U.S.—died June 13, 1987, New York, N.Y.) versatile American actress noted primarily for her interpretations of the heroines of Tennessee Williams’s plays.
Page had aspirations of becoming a pianist or visual artist, but at 17 she appeared in her first amateur theatre production, and from that point, she never wavered from her desire to be a professional actress. She attended (1942–45) the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago and later studied at the Herbert Berghof School and the American Theatre Wing drama school in New York City. She and others organized their own acting company at Lake Zurich, 35 miles (55 km) outside of Chicago, and for several years she spent her summers as a stock actress at Lake Zurich and her winters in New York City, looking for a role in a major production.
