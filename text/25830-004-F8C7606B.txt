Sir Henry Royce, Baronet, , in full Sir Frederick Henry, Baronet Royce   (born March 27, 1863, Alwalton, Huntingdonshire, Eng.—died  April 22, 1933, West Wittering, Sussex) English industrialist who was one of the founders of Rolls-Royce Ltd., manufacturer of luxury automobiles and airplane engines.
At age 15 Royce was an engineer apprenticed to the Great Northern Railway company at Peterborough, and by 1882 he was chief electrical engineer for Liverpool’s first electric street-lighting system. Two years later he moved to Manchester and started his own engineering business, which developed into Royce Ltd., manufacturers of electrically driven cranes, dynamos, and motors. In 1904 he built three experimental cars of his own design; their outstanding qualities came to the attention of the motor dealer C.S. Rolls, who soon agreed to take Royce’s entire output. Their firms merged in 1906 as Rolls-Royce Ltd.; the motor section of the business was moved to Derby in 1908. Royce was made a baronet in 1930 (there was no issue of his marriage, and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death).
