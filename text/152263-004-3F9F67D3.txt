Kobuk Valley National Park, large wilderness area in northwestern Alaska, U.S. It is part of a vast region of national parks, monuments, and preserves located north of the Arctic Circle that stretches for hundreds of miles from west to east. It is bordered to the north by Noatak National Preserve and to the south by Selawik National Wildlife Refuge. Proclaimed a national monument in 1978, it underwent boundary changes in 1980 when it became a national park. Its total area is 2,736 square miles (7,086 square km).
The park preserves the natural features of the Kobuk River valley, including the Kobuk, Salmon, and other rivers, a region of boreal forest (taiga), and the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes. The slow-moving westward-flowing Kobuk River, 1,500 feet (450 metres) at its widest point, lies in a shallow valley separating the Baird Mountains in the northern half of the park from the Waring Mountains on the parkâ€™s southern boundary. The Great Kobuk Sand Dunes, with crests rising to heights of 100 feet (30 metres) above the surrounding area, cover about 25 square miles (65 square km) southeast of the Kobuk River; nearby are the Little Kobuk Sand Dunes. Glacial-outwash streams emptying into what was once a large lake in the Kobuk valley are thought to have formed the dunes some 150,000 years ago.
