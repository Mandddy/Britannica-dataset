Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii), nonmigratory earless seal (family Phocidae) found around the South Pole, on or near the coast of Antarctica. The Weddell seal is a rotund animal that grows to about 3 metres (10 feet) in length and about 400 kg (880 pounds) in weight; the female is larger than the male. As a pup it is gray-coated, and as an adult it is dark gray above, lighter below, and marked with pale blotches. The Weddell seal lives alone or in groups and feeds on fish, cephalopods, and other marine animals. An accomplished diver, it has been known to remain submerged for 73 minutes and to descend to 600 metres. It winters under the ice, keeping breathing holes open by gnawing with its canine and incisor teeth.
