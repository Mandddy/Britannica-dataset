Jean-Pierre Blanchard, in full Jean-Pierre-François Blanchard  (born July 4, 1753, Les Andelys, France—died  March 7, 1809, Paris) French balloonist who, with the American physician John Jeffries, made the first aerial crossing of the English Channel. He was also the first to make balloon flights in England, North America, Germany, Belgium, and Poland.
During the 1770s Blanchard worked on the design of heavier-than-air flying machines, notably one based upon a theory of rowing in the air currents with oars and tiller. Following the demonstrations of hot-air-balloon flying by the Montgolfier brothers in Annonay, France, in 1783, Blanchard took up ballooning.
