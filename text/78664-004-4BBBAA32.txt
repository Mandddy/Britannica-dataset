Zhang Zhongjing, Wade-Giles romanization Chang Chung-ching  (born c. 150 ce—died c. 219) Chinese physician who wrote in the early 3rd century ce a work titled Shang han za bing lun (Treatise on Febrile and Other Diseases), which greatly influenced the practice of traditional Chinese medicine. The original work was later edited and divided into two books, Shang han lun (Treatise on Febrile Diseases) and Jin gui yao lue (Jingui Collection of Prescriptions). Today, Zhang’s work remains highly regarded and important in the practice of Chinese medicine, and he is often referred to as the Chinese Hippocrates.
Zhang’s Treatise was an important book on dietetics and was especially influential for its information on typhoid and other fevers. Zhang’s work was revered in the East for as long a time as Greek physician Galen of Pergamum’s works were popular in the West. Zhang described typhoid clearly and recommended the use of only a few potent drugs in treating it. The drugs were to be used one at a time, a considerable advance from the shotgun prescriptions then common. Zhang stated that cool baths were also an important part of the treatment, an idea that remained unused for 1,700 years until Scottish physician James Currie promoted it in his famous treatise on fever therapy.
