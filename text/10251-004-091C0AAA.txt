Liebknecht was killed in the Spartacus Revolt of January 1919.
The son of Wilhelm Liebknecht, Karl grew up during the years when the Anti-Socialist Law was in force against his father’s Socialist Labour Party (which became the Social Democratic Party in 1891). With financial help from the party, he studied law and political economy, first at Leipzig and then at Berlin, where he earned his doctor’s degree. He planned to devote his career to the defense of Marxism.
