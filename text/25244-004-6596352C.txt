Mount Hood National Forest, mountainous, heavily forested region in northwestern Oregon, U.S. The forest starts about 20 miles (32 km) east of Portland and extends southward along the Cascade Range from the Columbia River for more than 60 miles (100 km). It covers some 1,667 square miles (4,318 square km) of scenic mountains, lakes, and streams.
A large forest reserve was created in the Cascade Range in 1893, and a portion of that, called Oregon National Forest, was carved out of it in 1908. The name was changed to Mount Hood National Forest in 1924. The forest provides timber, water, forage, wildlife habitats, and recreation. It is drained by the Columbia, Sandy, Clackamas, Hood, and White rivers and their tributaries. Douglas fir is the dominant tree species. Mount Hood (11,239 feet [3,425 metres]), near the centre of the forest, is Oregonâ€™s highest point.
