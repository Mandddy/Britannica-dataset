Fothergill, a Quaker, studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and later became a highly successful London practitioner. His “Account of the Sore Throat Attended with Ulcers” (1748) was the first authoritative paper on diphtheria. He also described facial neuralgia and migraine. Fothergill popularized the use of coffee in England and promoted its cultivation in the West Indies. A friend of Benjamin Franklin, he collaborated with him on a plan for British reconciliation with the American colonies (1774).
