Eduard Suess,  (born Aug. 20, 1831, London, Eng.—died  April 26, 1914, Vienna, Austria) Austrian geologist who helped lay the basis for paleogeography and tectonics—i.e., the study of the architecture and evolution of the Earth’s outer rocky shell.
While an assistant in the Hofmuseum (now the Natural History Museum) in Vienna from 1852 to 1856, Suess published papers on the anatomy and classification of brachiopods and ammonites. In 1857 he published a small book entitled Die Enstehung der Alpen (“The Origin of the Alps”). In it he argued that horizontal movements of the lithosphere (the Earth’s rocky outer shell), rather than vertical uplift, played the dominant role in creating mountain ranges by folding and thrust faulting. Suess assumed that volcanism (notably magmatic activity) was a consequence of mountain building rather than its cause, as was widely held at that time.
