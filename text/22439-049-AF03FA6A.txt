Planetary boundary layer (PBL), also called atmospheric boundary layer,  the region of the lower troposphere where Earth’s surface strongly influences temperature, moisture, and wind through the turbulent transfer of air mass. As a result of surface friction, winds in the PBL are usually weaker than above and tend to blow toward areas of low pressure. For this reason, the planetary boundary layer has also been called an Ekman layer, for Swedish oceanographer Vagn Walfrid Ekman, a pioneer in the study of the behaviour of wind-driven ocean currents.
The PBL is covered by a layer of warmer air, creating what is known as a temperature inversion. The boundary between the cooler PBL below and the warmer layer above can be visually marked by the base of the clouds in the area. The top of the PBL can also be denoted by a thin layer of haze often seen by passengers aboard airplanes during takeoff from airports. During the day, the air within the PBL is thoroughly mixed by convection induced by the heating of Earth’s surface, and the very top of the PBL is an entrainment zone characterized by sporadic and weakening turbulence. The thickness of the PBL depends on the intensity of this surface heating and the amount of water evaporated into the air from the biosphere. In general, the greater the heating of the surface, the deeper the PBL. Over deserts, the PBL may extend up to 4,000 or 5,000 metres (13,100 or 16,400 feet) in altitude. In contrast, the PBL is less than 1,000 metres (3,300 feet) thick over ocean areas, since little surface heating takes place there because of the vertical mixing of water.
