Cavaliere D’Arpino, original name Giuseppe Cesari  (born c. 1568, Arpino, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died July 3, 1640, Rome) Italian painter of the post-Renaissance school known as Mannerism who helped to spread that school abroad.
The painter began his career as a workshop assistant for the decoration of the Vatican Loggia, directed by Niccolo Circignani. The artists he encountered during this experience (Circignani himself, Cristoforo Roncalli, and Giovanni Battista Ricci) had a great influence in his work. In 1589–91 Arpino executed extensive decorations in the Certosa of San Martino, Naples, where, as at Rome, he was assisted by his brother Bernadino. He was greatly in demand in Rome as a fresco painter, having impressed Pope Clement VIII with his facility of execution. But his frescoes in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, begun in 1596, were never finished. Perhaps his best work is the four incidents from the life of St. John the Baptist in the Church of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome. During his long career, he also created the designs for the mosaics of the cupola of St. Peter’s; the frescoes of the Cappella Paolina of the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore; and the fine murals in the Olgiati chapel in the Church of Santa Prassede. Although of wide reputation, Arpino did not compare in originality to contemporaries such as Caravaggio, the Carracci, or even some of his own students.
