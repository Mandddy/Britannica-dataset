Étienne-Louis Malus,  (born June 23, 1775, Paris—died  Feb. 23, 1812, Paris) French physicist who discovered that light, when reflected, becomes partially plane polarized; i.e., its rays vibrate in the same plane. His observation led to a better understanding of the propagation of light.
A member of the corps of engineers, Malus accompanied Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798 and remained in the Near East until 1801. After he returned, he held official posts at Antwerp, Strasbourg, and Paris and did research in optics. He published a paper in 1809 on his discovery of the polarization of light by reflection and a memoir in 1810 on the theory of double refraction (bending) of light in crystals.
