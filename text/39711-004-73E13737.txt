Sir Anthony Panizzi, original name Antonio Genesio Maria Panizzi   (born Sept. 16, 1797, Brescello [Italy]—died  April 8, 1879, London, Eng.) Italian patriot and man of letters who became famous as a librarian at the British Museum and played a part in the unification of Italy.
In 1822 Panizzi was forced into exile to avoid arrest as a revolutionary. He arrived in England in 1823 and, after teaching Italian at Liverpool, became professor of Italian at University College, London (1828–37). In 1831 he was named assistant librarian at the British Museum, and he became principal librarian in 1856. As a librarian and administrator, Panizzi was responsible for the reorganization and the new spirit of energy and concern for scholarship that made the museum one of the world’s great centres of culture. He planned and began work on the general catalog; secured strict enforcement of the 1842 Copyright Act; drew up a report on the library’s deficiencies that led to an increased grant for book purchases in 1845; improved staff conditions by insisting on the museum’s recognition as a branch of the civil service; and was responsible, through his friendship with Thomas Grenville, for the bequest of the Grenville library in 1846. He is best remembered, however, for designing and supervising the building of the Reading Room, opened in May 1857 (see illustration).
