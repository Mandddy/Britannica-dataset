Pauline Trigère,  (born November 4, 1908, Paris, France—died February 13, 2002, New York, New York, U.S.) French-born American couturiere whose award-winning design work was especially popular in the United States in the 1950s and ’60s.
Trigère was the daughter of a tailor. She early learned to sew and helped her mother custom-tailor women’s clothes. After graduating from the Collège Victor Hugo in Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, she went to work in the salon of Martial et Armand in the Place Vendôme, where she learned how to design and construct women’s clothing. In 1937 she moved to the United States and seven years later became a U.S. citizen.
