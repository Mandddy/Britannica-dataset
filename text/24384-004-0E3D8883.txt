Jean-Pierre Léaud,  (born May 5, 1944, Paris, France) French screen actor who played leading roles in some of the most important French New Wave films of the 1960s and ’70s, particularly ones by François Truffaut.
The son of a scriptwriter and an actress, Léaud at age 14 was chosen to play the misunderstood adolescent Antoine Doinel in François Truffaut’s first feature-length film, Les Quatre Cents Coups (1959; The 400 Blows). Léaud appeared in four more Truffaut films which traced Doinel’s progress through physical maturity, courtship, marriage, fatherhood, and finally divorce: these films are L’Amour à vingt ans (1962; Love at Twenty), Baisers volés (1968; Stolen Kisses), Domicile conjugale (1970; Bed and Board), and L’Amour en fuite (1979; Love on the Run). Léaud was perfectly suited to play the part of Doinel, an engaging and innocent young man who is not particularly well-equipped to meet the responsibilities of adult life. Léaud appeared in several other films by Truffaut, including Les Deux Anglaises et le continent (1971; Two English Girls; Anne and Muriel), and La Nuit américaine (1973; Day for Night).
