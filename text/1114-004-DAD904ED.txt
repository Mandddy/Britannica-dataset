Charlie Haden, byname of Charles Edward Haden   (born August 6, 1937, Shenandoah, Iowa, U.S.—died July 11, 2014, Los Angeles, California) American bass virtuoso and bandleader, known particularly as a pioneer of free jazz in the 1960s. He was among the most influential bassists in the jazz world.
From age two Haden sang with his family’s country music band on Midwestern radio and television programs. After graduating from high school in Missouri, he moved to Los Angeles and began to play jazz with saxophonist Art Pepper and others. While working (1957–59) in pianist Paul Bley’s group, Haden began playing free jazz with saxophonist Ornette Coleman, providing accompaniment with lines derived from Coleman’s phrasing. Haden was a member of the quartet that recorded Coleman’s early classic albums (The Shape of Jazz to Come and Change of the Century) and that created a sensation in New York City beginning in 1959.
