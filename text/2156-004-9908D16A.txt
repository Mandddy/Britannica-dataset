Kin selection, a type of natural selection that considers the role relatives play when evaluating the genetic fitness of a given individual. It is based on the concept of inclusive fitness, which is made up of individual survival and reproduction (direct fitness) and any impact that an individual has on the survival and reproduction of relatives (indirect fitness). Kin selection occurs when an animal engages in self-sacrificial behaviour that benefits the genetic fitness of its relatives. The theory of kin selection is one of the foundations of the modern study of social behaviour. British evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton first proposed the theory in 1963 and noted that it plays a role in the evolution of altruism, cooperation, and sociality; however, the term kin selection was coined in 1964 by British evolutionary biologist Maynard Smith.
The apparent altruistic behaviour of many animals is, like some manifestations of sexual selection, a trait that at first seems incompatible with the theory of natural selection. According to the theory of sexual selection, even though some individuals possess certain conspicuous physical traits (such as prominent coloration) that places them at greater risk of predation, the trait is thought to remain in the population because the possessors of such traits have greater success in obtaining mates. Altruism is a form of behaviour that benefits other individuals at the expense of the one that performs the action; the fitness of the altruist is diminished by its behaviour, whereas individuals that act selfishly benefit from it at no cost to themselves. Accordingly, it might be expected that natural selection would foster the development of selfish behaviour and eliminate altruism. This conclusion is not so compelling when it is noticed that the beneficiaries of altruistic behaviour are usually relatives. They all carry the same genes, including the genes that promote altruistic behaviour.
