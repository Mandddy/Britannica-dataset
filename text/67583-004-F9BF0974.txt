Juan Belmonte, in full Juan Belmonte y García  (born April 14, 1892, Triana, near Sevilla, Spain—died April 8, 1962, Utrera) Spanish bullfighter, one of the greatest toreros and the most revolutionary in his style.
About 1914, early in his career (which extended from 1910 to 1935), Belmonte introduced the technique of standing erect, nearly motionless, and much closer to the bull’s horns than earlier matadors had dared. Rather than using footwork to escape injury (accepted as the standard procedure before his time, but considered a sign of cowardice afterward), he diverted the bull’s charge with skillful capework so that the horns would barely miss him. The American novelist and aficionado Ernest Hemingway wrote (in Death in the Afternoon, 1932) that Belmonte “would wind a bull around him like a belt.”
