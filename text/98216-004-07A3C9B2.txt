Albert Pujols, in full José Alberto Pujols Alcántara  (born January 16, 1980, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic) Dominican-born American professional baseball player who was one of the most prolific hitters of the early 21st century.
Pujols was introduced to baseball early in life by his father, who was a popular pitcher in the Dominican Republic. The Pujols family immigrated to the United States when Albert was 16, and they eventually settled in Independence, Missouri. Pujols impressed major league scouts with his play at both the high school and collegiate level, and he was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 draft. He held out for a better signing bonus, however, and did not enter the minor leagues until the 2000 season. That was his only season in the minors, as an impressive performance in spring training earned him a spot on the Cardinals’ 2001 opening-day roster.
