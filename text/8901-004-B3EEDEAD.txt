Ushabti figure, also spelled shabti or shawabty,  any of the small statuettes made of wood, stone, or faience that are often found in large numbers in ancient Egyptian tombs. The figures range in height from approximately 4 to 20 inches (10 to 50 cm) and often hold hoes in their arms. Their purpose was to act as a magical substitute for the deceased owner when the gods requested him to undertake menial tasks in the afterlife; the word ushabti is usually translated as “answerer.” During the New Kingdom (1539–1075 bce) the figures were made to resemble the tomb owner by being fashioned in the form of a mummy bearing the owner’s name.
