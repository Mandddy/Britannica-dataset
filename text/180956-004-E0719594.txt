Gui River, Chinese (Pinyin) Gui Jiang or (Wade-Giles romanization) Kuei Chiang, conventional Kwei Kiang,  northern tributary of the Xi River, southern China. Its upper course is also called the Li River. The Gui River rises in the Maoâ€™er Mountains to the north of Guilin in the northern part of the Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi and flows southward to join the Xi at Wuzhou on the border of Guangxi and Guangdong province. The level of the river varies from season to season, and its course has many dangerous rapids. Shallow-draft junks can reach Pingle and, during the high-water season, go as far as Guilin.
Above Guilin the ancient Ling Canal, constructed in the 2nd century bce, leads over the watershed to connect the Gui with the upper waters of the Xiang River in Hunan province. The Gui is also followed by a main highway from Hunan into Guangxi and Guangdong; the river itself serves as an important means of transporting the timber that is felled in the forests of northeastern Guangxi to the Xi River and thence to Guangzhou (Canton).
