Hansom cab,  low, two-wheeled, closed carriage patented in 1834, whose distinctive feature was the elevated driverâ€™s seat in the rear. It was entered from the front through a folding door and had one seat above the axle with room for two passengers. The driver spoke to the passengers through a trapdoor on top.
Though named for its original designer, Joseph Hansom, the cab was redesigned and patented by John Chapman in 1836, after which it became the most popular cab in London. After additional improvements were made by coach builder F. Forder in 1873, the vehicle was introduced successfully in New York City and Boston.
