Thomas Arne, in full Thomas Augustine Arne  (born March 12, 1710, London, Eng.—died  March 5, 1778, London) English composer, chiefly of dramatic music and song.
According to tradition, Arne was the son of an upholsterer in King Street, Covent Garden. Educated at Eton, he was intended for the law, but by secretly practicing he acquired such mastery of the violin and keyboard instruments that his father withdrew all objections to a musical career. Except for some lessons from Michael Festing, later leader of the Italian Opera orchestra, Arne was self-taught, and it was at the Opera (which he attended in a footman’s livery to obtain free admission) that his musical taste was largely formed. He taught both his sister, later famous as the actress Mrs. Cibber, and his young brother to sing, and they appeared in his first stage work, Rosamond (1733). This opera, based on Joseph Addison’s libretto of 1707, was set “after the Italian manner,” and its bravura air “Rise, Glory, Rise” was sung for the next 40 years.
