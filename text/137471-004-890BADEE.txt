Steve Yzerman, in full Stephen Gregory Yzerman, byname the Captain  (born May 9, 1965, Cranbrook, British Columbia, Canada) Canadian American professional ice hockey player who—as the longest-serving captain in National Hockey League (NHL) history—led the Detroit Red Wings to three Stanley Cup championships (1997, 1998, and 2002).
From 1981 to 1983 Yzerman played centre with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League, where he became noted for his offensive play. In the 1983 NHL draft he was selected as the fourth overall pick by the Red Wings, a storied franchise that had struggled in recent years. Yzerman had a stellar rookie season (1983–84), scoring 39 goals and 48 assists and earning a number of accolades. He was named runner-up for the Calder Trophy for best rookie in the NHL, and he played in his first of 10 All-Star games. At the beginning of the 1986–87 season, Yzerman became the youngest player to be named captain of the Wings. Two seasons later (1988–89), he recorded 155 points (65 goals and 90 assists) and received the Lester B. Pearson Award for best player, as decided by fellow players.
