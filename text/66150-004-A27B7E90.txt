Sir Sean Connery, original name Thomas Connery  (born Aug. 25, 1930, Edinburgh, Scot.) Scottish-born actor whose popularity in James Bond spy thrillers led to a successful, decades-long film career.
After a three-year stint in the navy and a series of odd jobs, Connery became a model for student artists and men’s fashion catalogs. He represented Scotland in the 1953 Mr. Universe contest (he finished third in the tall-man’s division), which in turn led to work as an extra in stage productions. In 1954 he landed a small part in a touring production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical South Pacific and eventually took the leading role. More stage and television work followed, including a much-praised performance as washed-up boxer Mountain Rivera in the BBC television production of Rod Serling’s Requiem for a Heavyweight. Connery made his film debut in Lilacs in the Spring (1954; U.S. title Let’s Make Up) and received top billing for the first time in On the Fiddle (1961; also released as Operation Snafu). His other notable films of the period include the Disney fantasy Darby O’Gill and the Little People (1959) and the World War II epic The Longest Day (1962).
