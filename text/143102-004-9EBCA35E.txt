Antony Gormley, in full Antony Mark David Gormley  (born August 30, 1950, London, England) British sculptor and draftsman best known for his work with human forms, which he created chiefly from casts of his own naked body. In these artworks he examined aspects of the human presence in the world, often employing more than one figure placed within a landscape or cityscape. In 1994 he won the Turner Prize for contemporary art for a group of figural installations created under his direction.
Gormley attended Trinity College, Cambridge (1968â€“71), taking a degree in art history, archaeology, and anthropology, and thereafter traveled in India and Sri Lanka for three years. Upon his return to London, he studied at the Central School of Arts and Crafts (now Central Saint Martins), Goldsmiths College, and the Slade School of Fine Art. Struck by the manner in which people he had seen on his travels had created a private space in public places by covering themselves with a piece of cloth, he made his first plaster casts involving the human form. But the human form was only one of the subjects of his early work.
