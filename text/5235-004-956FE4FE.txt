Bacchylides,  (born c. 510 bc, Ceos [Cyclades, Greece]) Greek lyric poet, nephew of the poet Simonides and a younger contemporary of the Boeotian poet Pindar, with whom he competed in the composition of epinician poems (odes commissioned by victors at the major athletic festivals).
The 3rd-century-bc scholars at the great library at Alexandria, Egypt, listed Bacchylides among the canonical nine lyric poets, and they produced an edition of his poems. The poems remained popular until at least the 4th century ad, when the emperor Julian was said by the Latin historian Ammianus Marcellinus to have enjoyed them. The works were lost (except as they were quoted by others) until the discovery of papyrus texts that reached the British Museum in 1896 and were published in 1897. The papyri contained the texts of 21 poems in whole or in part; 14 are epinicia, and the remainder are dithyrambs (choral songs in honour of Dionysus). Fragments derived from quotations by ancient authors and later papyrus finds include passages from paeans (hymns in honour of Apollo and other gods) and encomiums (songs in honour of distinguished men).
