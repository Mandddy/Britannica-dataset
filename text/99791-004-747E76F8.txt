Cereal farming, growing of cereal crops for human food and livestock feed, as well as for other uses, including industrial starch and biofuel. Cereals, or grains, are members of the grass family (Poaceae) cultivated primarily for their starchy dry fruits. Wheat, rice, corn (maize), rye, oats, barley, sorghum, and some of the millets are common cereals.
The cultivation of cereals varies widely in different countries and depends partly upon the degree of economic development. Other factors include the nature of the soil, the amount of rainfall, and the techniques applied to promote growth. In illustrating production problems, this article uses wheat as the example. For information on the cultivation of other cereal crops, see articles on the individual crops. For information on the food value and processing of cereals, see the article cereal processing.
