Retaining wall, also called revetment or breast wall,  freestanding wall that either resists some weight on one side or prevents the erosion of an embankment. It may also be “battered”—that is, inclined toward the load it is bearing.
There are a number of methods employed to resist the lateral force against such a wall. The most basic type of reinforced retaining wall is the gravity wall, which is of massive concrete that is prevented from falling over by simple gravity. The cantilever retaining wall has cantilever footings, which have tie beams balancing the asymmetrical load. A counterfort retaining wall is a cantilever wall with counterforts, or buttresses, attached to the inside face of the wall to further resist lateral thrust. Some common materials used for retaining walls are treated lumber, concrete block systems, poured concrete, stone, and brick.
