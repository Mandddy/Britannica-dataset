Benjamin Apthorp Gould,  (born Sept. 27, 1824, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died  Nov. 26, 1896, Cambridge, Mass.) American astronomer whose star catalogs helped fix the list of constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.
A child prodigy who could read aloud at age three and compose poems in Latin at age five, Gould studied mathematics and the physical sciences under Benjamin Peirce at Harvard University. In 1845 he went to Germany to study astronomy and was the first American to earn a doctorate in this field, at the University of Göttingen in 1848. Returning to the United States, Gould was anxious to raise American astronomy to the European level. In 1849 he founded The Astronomical Journal, which was modeled on the German journal Astronomische Nachrichten and was the first journal of professional astronomical research published in the United States. Publication lapsed in 1861 because of financial difficulties and the outbreak of the Civil War. After a 25-year hiatus, Gould restarted The Astronomical Journal in 1886, and it continues to the present-day.
