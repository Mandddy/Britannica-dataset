Puffbird, any of about 34 species of tropical American birds that constitute the family Bucconidae (order Piciformes). They are named for their habit of perching tamely in the open with the feathers of their large heads and short necks puffed out. Some species are known as nunlets and nunbirds.
Puffbirds feed on flying insects. They resemble their close relatives the jacamars in habits but are thick-billed and plain colouredâ€”rather shrikelike. They nest in holes that they dig in sloping or flat ground. Widespread species include the collared puffbird (Bucco capensis), 18 cm (7 inches) long, in northern South America east of the Andes; and the white-necked, or large-billed, puffbird (Notharchus macrorhynchos), 24 cm (9 inches) long, ranging from Mexico to Argentina.
