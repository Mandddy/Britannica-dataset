Musk deer (Moschus moschiferus), small compact deer, family Cervidae (order Artiodactyla). A solitary shy animal, the musk deer lives in mountainous regions from Siberia to the Himalayas. It has large ears, a very short tail, no antlers, and, unlike all other deer, a gall bladder. The musk deer is grayish brown, with long coarse brittle hair, and stands 50–60 cm (20–24 inches) at the shoulder, slightly higher at the rump. The male has long upper canine teeth that project downward from the mouth as tusks and has a musk-producing organ, the musk pod, on its abdomen. The musk from that organ is valued for use in perfumes and soaps.
