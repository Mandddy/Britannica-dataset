Grison, also called Huron,   (Spanish: “ferret”), either of two weasellike carnivores of the genus Galictis (sometimes Grison), family Mustelidae, found in most regions of Central and South America; sometimes tamed when young. These animals have small, broad ears, short legs, and slender bodies 40–50 cm (16–22 inches) long, weighing 1–3 kg (2–6.5 pounds); the tail accounts for an additional 15–20 cm (6–8 inches). Their backs are grayish or brown and their limbs, lower parts, and faces are black; a white stripe runs across the forehead and along the sides of the neck. Gregarious and generally diurnal, they climb, swim, and burrow adeptly and feed on small animals and fruit. Their litters contain two to four young.
