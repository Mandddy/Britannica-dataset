Cord moss, any of the plants of the genus Funaria (subclass Bryidae), distinguished by the spirally twisted seta (stalk) of the capsule (spore case). About 86 species of Funaria are found in many habitats throughout the world, especially on limestone or recently burned areas. About nine species are present in North America; the most common is F. hygrometrica, which is often described in textbooks as a representative bryophyte (member of a group including mosses and liverworts).
Pale-green, loose tufts of cord moss may form large carpets. Male and female reproductive organs are borne on separate branches of the same plant; each cluster of male organs is surrounded by a group of large phyllids (leaves), forming a structure resembling a small green flower. The numerous curved, yellowish or orange-brown capsules shed their spores through an obliquely placed “mouth.” Each capsule stalk is moisture sensitive, curling when dry and unwinding when wet.
