Athabasca River, river in northern Alberta, Canada, forming the southernmost part of the Mackenzie River system. From its source in the Columbia Icefield (Canadian Rocky Mountains) near the Continental Divide, the river flows through Jasper National Park, site of the spectacular Athabasca Falls, and winds northeastward across Alberta to its mouth and delta on Lake Athabasca. Its 765-mile (1,231-km) course is broken by rapids, so that navigation is limited above Fort McMurray (a major rail terminus and port serving the Mackenzie District). Chief tributaries include the McLeod, Pembina, Lesser Slave, and Clearwater rivers. One of the worldâ€™s richest petroleum deposits lies in oil-impregnated sands (known as the Athabasca tar sands) along a 70-mile (113-km) stretch of the river near Fort McMurray.
