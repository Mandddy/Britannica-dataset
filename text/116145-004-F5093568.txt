River Dee, Welsh Afon Dyfrdwy,  river in northern Wales and England, approximately 70 miles (110 km) long. It rises in the county of Gwynedd on the slopes of Dduallt, in Snowdonia National Park, and falls rapidly to Bala Lake. Its valley then runs northeast to Corwen and eastward past Llangollen. The Vale of Llangollen contains Thomas Telfordâ€™s aqueduct (1805) for the Shropshire Union Canal. Leaving the mountains, the Dee meanders northward across the rich pastureland of the Cheshire plain; below Chester it is confined in a straight, artificial channel. Its estuary, 12 miles (19 km) long by 5 miles (8 km) wide at its mouth and very shallow, has expanses of sand and marsh; the main town on the estuary is Flint.
