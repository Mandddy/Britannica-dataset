Ralph Linton,  (born Feb. 27, 1893, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Dec. 24, 1953, New Haven, Conn.) American anthropologist who had a marked influence on the development of cultural anthropology.
As an undergraduate at Swarthmore College, Philadelphia, Linton pursued archaeological interests, taking part in expeditions to New Mexico, Colorado, and Guatemala (1912 and 1913). Following his graduation (1915) he examined a prehistoric site in New Jersey, the subject of his first professional writings. He returned to the Southwest again (1916 and 1919), but a two-year stay in the Marquesas Islands, beginning in 1920, diverted his interest from archaeology to ethnology. He became curator of American Indian and Oceanic collections at the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago (1922–28). He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University (1925) and made a one-man expedition to Madagascar and East Africa (1925–27) that resulted in his major ethnological work, The Tanala, a Hill Tribe of Madagascar (1933), and a major collection of artifacts, now mainly at the Field Museum.
