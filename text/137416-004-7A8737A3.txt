Jungle babbler, any of about 32 species of songbirds constituting the tribe Pellorneini of the babbler family Timaliidae. Found from Africa to Malaysia and the Philippines, these drab birds with slender, often hook-tipped bills skulk in forest undergrowth. An example is the striped jungle babbler, or spotted babbler (Pelloreum ruficeps), of Southeast Asiaâ€”16 centimetres (61/4 inches) long, with reddish cap, white eyeline, dark greenish back, and streaked white breast. It is usually detected by its loud two-note whistle.
