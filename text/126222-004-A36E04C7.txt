Maccabiah Games, international games held in Palestine (later Israel) from 1932, sponsored by the World Maccabi Union, an international Jewish sports organization founded in 1921. Events held are such Olympic events as athletics (track and field), swimming, water polo, fencing, boxing, wrestling, football (soccer), basketball, tennis, table tennis, and volleyball and such non-Olympic events as karate.
The Games are open to Jewish athletes from all over the world. The first two Games were held in 1932 and 1935, the latter drawing 1,700 competitors from 27 countries. The anti-Semitic climate of the 1930s led to the permanent settlement of many Maccabiah competitors, coaches, and trainers in Palestine. The Games resumed in 1950 and from 1953 were held every four years. A permanent Maccabiah village was built for competitors and their staffs. By the early 21st century, the Games attracted more than 2,000 competitors from almost 50 countries.
