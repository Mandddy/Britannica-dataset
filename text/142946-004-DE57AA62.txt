Achelous River, Modern Greek Akhelóös Potamós, also called Aspropótamos ,  one of the longest rivers in Greece, rising in the Pindus (Modern Greek: Píndos) Mountains of central Epirus (Ípeiros) and dividing Aetolia from Acarnania. It empties into the Ionian Sea (Ióvio Pélagos) after a course of 140 miles (220 km), mostly through gorges. Well above Agrínion two hydroelectric dams were built to harness the waters of the river and its tributaries. One is at Kastraki; the other, at Kremasta, is the highest (490 feet [150 metres]) earth-fill dam in Europe. At the mouth of the river, where it is less than 2 feet deep, a number of small islands, the Ekhinádhes, have been enveloped by the silt. The name Aspropótamos (White River) is given to several other rivers in Greece, and the name Achelous appears in cult and in Greek mythology as that of the most familiar form of river god.
