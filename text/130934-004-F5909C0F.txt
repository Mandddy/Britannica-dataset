Robert C. Byrd, in full Robert Carlyle Byrd, original name Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr.  (born November 20, 1917, North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, U.S.—died June 28, 2010, Falls Church, Virginia) American Democratic politician who served as a representative from West Virginia in the U.S. House of Representatives (1953–59) and as a U.S. senator from West Virginia (1959–2010). Byrd was the longest-serving member of the Senate and longest-serving member of Congress in American history. In his decades-long Senate career, Byrd held various leadership positions, including Democratic whip (1971–77), majority leader (1977–80, 1987–88), minority leader (1981–86), and president pro tempore (1989–95, 2001–03, 2007–10).
Following the death of his mother in 1918, he was adopted by his aunt and uncle and raised in southern West Virginia; they changed his name from Cornelius Calvin Sale, Jr., to Robert Carlyle Byrd. After graduating from high school in a class of fewer than 30 students, he was a part-time student at Beckley College, Concord College, Morris Harvey College, and Marshall College (now Marshall University), all in West Virginia. Although he did not complete his bachelor’s degree from Marshall University until 1994, he earned a law degree (1963) from American University in Washington, D.C., while serving in the Senate. In the early 1940s Byrd organized a local Ku Klux Klan chapter, although years later he had a change of heart and became a strong supporter of civil rights. He worked as a butcher, a coal miner, and a grocery store proprietor before launching his political career by getting elected to the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1946. He served in the state senate (1951–52) before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952 and to the U.S. Senate in 1958.
