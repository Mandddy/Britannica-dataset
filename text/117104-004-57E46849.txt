Partridge,  any of many small game birds native to the Old World and belonging to the family Phasianidae (order Galliformes). They are larger than quails, with stronger bills and feet. (For New World birds erroneously called partridges, see grouse; quail. For dwarf partridges of India called bush quail and for the Mexican bird called long-tailed partridge, see quail.)
The typical partridge of Europe is the gray partridge (Perdix perdix), called Hungarian (or hun) partridge in North America, where it was introduced in 1889 (Virginia) and again, much more successfully, in 1908â€“09 (Alberta). It ranges throughout the British Isles and across Europe to the Caspian region. The gray partridge has a reddish face and tail, gray breast, barred sides, and a dark U shape on the belly; sexes look alike. The hen lays about 15 eggs in a grassy cup in grainfields or hedges. A large male is 30 cm (12 inches) long and may weigh 0.33 kg (0.75 pound). Gray partridges prefer farmlands, where family groups (coveys) forage for seeds and insects.
