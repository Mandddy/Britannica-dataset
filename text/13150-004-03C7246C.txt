Ingrid Bergman,  (born Aug. 29, 1915, Stockholm, Sweden—died  Aug. 29, 1982, London, Eng.) one of the most popular motion-picture actresses in the United States from the 1940s until her death and an international star in Swedish, French, German, Italian, and British films. Her natural charm, freshness, intelligence, and vitality made her the image of sincerity and ideal womanhood.
Despite shyness and the resistance of her family, Bergman worked assiduously for admission to the Royal Dramatic Theatre School in Stockholm, where she studied for a year. Her screen debut in Munkbrogreven (1935; The Count of the Monk’s Bridge), was followed by challenging roles in such Swedish films as the original Intermezzo (1936) and En kvinnas ansikte (1938; A Woman’s Face). Taken to the United States to star in the Hollywood version of Intermezzo (1939; released in Great Britain as Escape to Happiness), Bergman achieved tremendous popularity through a series of critical and commercial successes that included Casablanca (1942); For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943); Gaslight (1944), for which she won the Academy Award for best actress; Saratoga Trunk (1945); The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945); and two thrillers directed by Alfred Hitchcock, Spellbound (1945) and Notorious (1946).
