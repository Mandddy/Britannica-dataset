Jumping mouse (subfamily Zapodinae), any of five species of small leaping rodents found in North America and China. Jumping mice weigh from 13 to 26 grams (0.5 to 0.9 ounce) and are 8 to 11 cm (3.1 to 4.3 inches) long, not including the scantily haired tail, which is longer than the body. Their glossy fur is soft or slightly coarse; coloration is tripartite: brown on top from nose to rump, grayish to rust-coloured on the sides, and white on the underparts. The tail is brown above and white below.
Jumping mice normally run on all four legs or bounce along in a series of short hops, but when alarmed they leap powerfully yet erratically up to 4 metres (13 feet), using their disproportionately long hind legs. They are balanced by the slender tail.
