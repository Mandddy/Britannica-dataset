John VI Cantacuzenus,  (born 1292â€”died  June 15, 1383, Mistra, Byzantine Empire) statesman, Byzantine emperor, and historian whose dispute with John V Palaeologus over the imperial throne induced him to appeal for help to the Turks, aiding them in their conquest of the Byzantine Empire.
John was chief adviser to Andronicus III Palaeologus, having helped him gain the throne from his grandfather Andronicus II. From 1328 to 1341 Cantacuzenus directed both domestic and foreign policy for the Emperor. He encouraged a reform of the law courts and promoted commercial independence from the Genoese and Venetians by initiating a large shipbuilding project. He distinguished himself in battle against the Serbs and in 1337 helped incorporate the despotate of Epirus, in western Greece, into the empire.
