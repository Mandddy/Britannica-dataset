Peter Brook, in full Peter Stephen Paul Brook  (born March 21, 1925, London, England) English producer-director of Shakespeare’s plays whose daring productions of other dramatists’ works contributed significantly to the development of the 20th century’s avant-garde stage.
Attaining at an early age the status of one of the foremost British directors, Brook directed his first Shakespeare play, King John, in 1945 for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. He also introduced to England the avant-garde plays of Jean Cocteau (The Infernal Machine, performed 1945) and of Jean-Paul Sartre (Vicious Circle [No Exit], performed 1946; The Respectable Prostitute and Men Without Shadows, both performed 1947). In 1948 and 1949, for the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden in London, he directed several productions, notably Richard Strauss’s opera Salome, with costumes and set designs by Salvador Dalí. Thereafter he continued to present Shakespeare’s plays, always with a fresh and inventive approach, as well as those of many contemporary playwrights. These included Measure for Measure (1950), The Winter’s Tale (1951), Titus Andronicus (1955), Hamlet (1955), The Tempest (1957), and King Lear (1962). Toward the end of that period, he also began to examine the theatre of provocation, and, influenced by Antonin Artaud’s tenets of the Theatre of Cruelty, he produced Jean Genet’s Le Balcon (produced 1960, in Paris; The Balcony) and The Screens (1964), as well as Peter Weiss’s sensational play Marat/Sade (1964), as it is commonly called, the unconventional style and staging of which shocked the theatre world and won Brook international fame. He gained further renown by directing a 1967 film version of the play.
