RNA interference (RNAi), regulatory system occurring within eukaryotic cells (cells with a clearly defined nucleus) that controls the activity of genes. RNAi functions specifically to silence, or deactivate, genes.
The ability of interfering RNA to silence genes was discovered in the 1990s by American scientists Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello, who shared the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their work. Fire and Mello successfully inhibited the expression of specific genes by introducing short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments into the cells of nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans). The dsRNA segments underwent enzymatic processing that enabled them to attach to molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA) possessing complementary nucleotide sequences. The attachment of the two RNAs inhibited the translation of the mRNA molecules into proteins.
