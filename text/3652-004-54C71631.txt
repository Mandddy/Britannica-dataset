Pierre Puget,  (born October 16, 1620, at or near Marseille, France—died December 2, 1694, Marseille) French Baroque sculptor, as well as a painter and architect, whose dramatic style at times chafed the traditional Classicism of the French court.
Puget traveled in Italy as a young man (1640–43), when he was employed by a muralist, Pietro da Cortona, to work on the ceiling decorations of the Barberini Palace in Rome and the Pitti Palace in Florence. Between 1643 and 1656 he was active in Marseille and Toulon chiefly as a painter, but he also carved colossal figureheads for men-of-war. He received an important sculpture commission in 1656 for the doorway of the Hôtel de Ville, Toulon; his caryatid figures there, although in the tradition of Roman Baroque, show a strain and an anguish that are similar to the Mannerist works of Michelangelo. Such feelings are passionately expressed in works such as the Milo of Crotona (c. 1671–82), in which the athlete Milo, whose hand is caught in a tree stump, is portrayed under attack by a lion.
