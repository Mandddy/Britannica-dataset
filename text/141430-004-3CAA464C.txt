Moonfish,  any of several fishes of the order Perciformes, such as Vomer setapinnis of the family Carangidae, and Mene maculata, the sole member of the family Menidae.
The carangid moonfish is thin, with an extremely deep body, a slender tail base, a forked tail, and slim, sickle-shaped pectoral fins. It is silver or golden in colour and grows to about 30 centimetres (12 inches). It inhabits the western Atlantic Ocean and, when young, is distinguished by long, threadlike rays extending from its dorsal and pelvic fins. Related species, also deep-bodied and called moonfish, are the Pacific Vomer declivifrons and the lookdown (Selene vomer) of the Atlantic and Pacific.
