Exposure meter, also called light meter,  photographic auxiliary device that measures the intensity of light and indicates proper exposure (i.e., the combination of aperture and shutter speed) for film or image sensors of a specific sensitivity. Traditional exposure meters are separate handheld devices, though almost every modern camera, both film and digital, comes with a built-in meter.
Older light meters were of the self-generating, or photovoltaic, type, in which a selenium element converted the incoming light directly into an electric current. A microammeter measured this current and was calibrated to indicate the intensity of the light. Exposure was then set by adjusting dials to control aperture opening and shutter speed, taking into consideration the specific sensitivity of the film.
