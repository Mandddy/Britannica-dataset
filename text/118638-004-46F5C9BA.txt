Mamoré River, Spanish Río Mamoré ,  river in north-central Bolivia. It is formed by headwaters, chiefly the Grande River, which arise in Andean cordilleras and drain the Moxos (Mojos) plain, an ancient lake bed. The Mamoré meanders generally northward to the Brazilian border, at which point it is joined by the Iténez River (Portuguese: Guaporé). It constitutes the Bolivia-Brazil frontier as far north as Villa Bella, where it joins the Beni River to form the Madeira. The Mamoré’s importance as a transport route is diminished by the presence of rapids, but the river is navigable through the Moxos plain and tropical forest to Guajará-Mirim, Brazil, the southern terminus of the now-defunct Madeira-Mamoré Railway. Numerous indigenous communities inhabit the banks of the river. Tourism has increased along parts of the river, with nearby towns offering boat cruises. The river’s total length is approximately 1,200 miles (1,900 km).
