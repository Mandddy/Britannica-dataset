Iguaçu River, also spelled Iguassú, Portuguese Rio Iguaçu, Spanish Río Iguazú,  river flowing through Santa Catarina and Paraná states in southern Brazil. The Iguaçu is formed by headstreams rising in the Serra do Mar near Curitiba. It winds generally westward through the uplands for about 820 miles (1,320 km) before joining the Paraná River at the point where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. It forms a small portion of the Brazilian-Argentine border. Although sections of the river are navigable, it is known chiefly for the spectacular Iguaçu Falls. Hydroelectric plants are located on the river at the Segredo, Osorio, and Santiago falls.
