Caernarvonshire, also spelled Carnarvonshire, also called Caernarvon or Carnarvon, Welsh Sir Gaernarfon,  historic county of northwestern Wales, bordered on the north by the Irish Sea, on the east by Denbighshire, on the south by the county of Merioneth and Cardigan Bay, and on the west by Caernarfon Bay and the Menai Strait, which separates it from Anglesey. The total area is 569 square miles (1,473 square km). Most of the historic county lies within the present and larger county of Gwynedd. The easternmost portion of Caernarvonshire, which drains into the River Conwy, forms part of the present county borough of Conwy.
The earliest human settlements in the area of Caernarvonshire were Neolithic (c. 2000 bce). A Neolithic stone-axe-making site was discovered near the town of Penmaenmawr, and the remains of a Bronze Age stone circle are located on the crest of a hill above the town. The culture of the Beaker folk had reached the area by about 1500 bce, and finds suggest that in the Bronze Age it was crossed by important trade routes linking the Mediterranean, Ireland, and northern Europe. The area’s inhabitants had adopted Celtic culture and language by 500–300 bce, and a Celtic tribe, the Ordovices, occupied the region at the time of the Roman invasion (c. 61 ce). Complete Roman conquest of the area was achieved in 71–78, forts subsidiary to Deva (Chester) being established at Canovium (Caerhun, near Conwy) and at Segontium (Caernarfon). Many Christian sites date from about the 6th century.
