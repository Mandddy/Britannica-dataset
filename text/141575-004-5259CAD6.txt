Écrins National Park, nature reserve located in the départements of Hautes-Alpes and Isère, southeastern France. The park, which was created in 1973, occupies 226,694 acres (91,740 hectares) and is the second largest national park in France. It encompasses the Alpine peaks of Barre des Écrins (13,457 feet [4,102 m]), La Meije (13,067 feet [3,983 m]), Ailefroide, and Pelvoux, as well as numerous lakes, cirques, and gorges. Forests of larch cover the park. Rarer plants include lady’s slipper orchids, orange lilies, and martagon lilies. Mountain hares and foxes, marmots, and chamois are common, while ibex, reintroduced in 1977 and 1978, are rare. Birds are typically Alpine and include golden eagles, capercaillies, rock partridges, and ptarmigans. More than 438,000 acres (177,000 hectares) bordering the park have been designated as a peripheral, or buffer, zone, where tourist activities and related businesses are permitted. The aim of the park is to preserve, where possible, the cultural and architectural heritage of the different communities.
