Heinrich Mann,  (born March 27, 1871, Lübeck, Ger.—died  March 12, 1950, Santa Monica, Calif., U.S.) German novelist and essayist, a socially committed writer whose best-known works are attacks on the authoritarian social structure of German society under Emperor William II.
Mann, the elder brother of the novelist Thomas Mann, entered publishing, but, after the death (1891) of their father, a prosperous grain merchant, he became financially independent and lived in Berlin, spending long periods abroad, particularly in France. His early novels portray the decadence of high society (Im Schlaraffenland [1900; In the Land of Cockaigne]), and his later books deal with the greed for wealth, position, and power in William’s Germany. Mann’s merciless portrait of a tyrannical provincial schoolmaster, Professor Unrat (1905; Small Town Tyrant), became widely known through its film version Der blaue Engel (1928; The Blue Angel). His Kaiserreich trilogy—consisting of Die Armen (1917; The Poor); Der Untertan (1918; The Patrioteer); and Der Kopf (1925; The Chief)—carries even further his indictment of the social types produced by the authoritarian state. These novels were accompanied by essays attacking the arrogance of authority and the subservience of the subjects. A lighter work of this period is Die kleine Stadt (1909; The Little Town).
