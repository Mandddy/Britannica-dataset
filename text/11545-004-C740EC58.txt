Étienne-François Geoffroy, also called Geoffroy L’aîné, orGeoffroy The Elder   (born Feb. 13, 1672, Paris, Fr.—died  Jan. 6, 1731, Paris) French chemist, the first chemist to speak of affinity in terms of fixed attractions between different bodies.
Assuming that one acid displaces another acid of weaker affinity for a specific base in the salt of that base, Geoffroy composed tables (1718) listing the relative affinities of different reagents for particular substances. Geoffroy’s tables remained an authoritative reference throughout most of the 18th century, until they were invalidated by Claude-Louis Berthollet’s demonstration that the thoroughness of chemical reactions depends upon the relative quantities of the starting materials and the physical conditions pertaining during the reaction.
