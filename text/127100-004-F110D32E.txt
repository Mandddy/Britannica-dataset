Fremont Lawson, in full Victor Fremont Lawson, Fremont also spelled Freemont   (born September 9, 1850, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died August 19, 1925, Chicago) newspaper editor and publisher, one of the first in the United States to assign correspondents to live and gather news in major cities outside the country. Before this innovation (1898) American newspapers relied on dispatches from British or other foreign sources. He also led the successful effort of Western publishers to rescue the Associated Press (AP) from a combine that leaked its news to the rival United Press (UP).
Already the owner of a Norwegian-language paper in Chicago, Lawson in 1876 bought an interest in the Chicago Daily News, which had been founded in 1875 by Melville Elijah Stone (1848–1929) as the first one-cent newspaper in the Midwest. Under Lawson’s business management the circulation of the Daily News increased markedly within a year. In 1881 Lawson and Stone started a morning edition that later (1883) was called the Chicago Record. After numerous mergers and variations in name, it was known as the Record-Herald when Lawson sold his interest (1914) and as Chicago’s American when it ceased publication (1969). Lawson retained proprietorship of the Daily News until his death.
