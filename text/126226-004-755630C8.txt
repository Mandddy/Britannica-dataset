Cepheid variable, one of a class of variable stars whose periods (i.e., the time for one cycle) of variation are closely related to their luminosity and that are therefore useful in measuring interstellar and intergalactic distances. Most are spectral type F (moderately hot) at maximum luminosity and type G (cooler, Sun-like) at minimum. The prototype star is Delta Cephei, the variability of which was discovered by John Goodricke in 1784. In 1912 Henrietta Leavitt of Harvard Observatory discovered the aforementioned period-luminosity relationship of the Cepheids.
Cepheids are now considered to fall into two distinct classes. The classical Cepheids have periods from about 1.5 days to more than 50 days and belong to the class of relatively young stars found largely in the spiral arms of galaxies and called Population I. Population II Cepheids are much older, less luminous, and less massive than their Population I counterparts. They fall into two groupsâ€”W Virginis stars with periods greater than about 10 days and BL Herculis stars with periods of a few days.
