Guaporé River, Portuguese Rio Guaporé, Spanish Río Iténez ,  river flowing through west central Brazil. The river rises in the Serra (mountains) dos Parecis in Mato Grosso state, Brazil, and loops southward, westward, and then north-northwestward past Mato Grosso city. After receiving the Rio Verde, it continues northwestward, forming the border between Bolivia and Brazil and emptying into the Mamoré River above the town of Guajará-Mirim. The Guaporé is the largest affluent of the Mamoré and is navigable along its 1,087-mile (1,749-km) course all year. It flows through a region of tropical rainforest, the inhabitants of which include settlements of Indians and mestizos along the banks. In contrast with the brown, silt-laden Mamoré, the Guaporé has unusually clear water. For several miles below their juncture, the identity of the two streams can still be readily perceived. Historically, the region was witness to numerous frontier conflicts between the Spanish and the Portuguese and the struggles of both with hostile Indians. Forte Príncipe da Beira, constructed near the confluence of the Guaporé and the Mamoré in the late 18th century, is a reminder of this era.
