Willis Conover,  (born December 18, 1920, Buffalo, New York, U.S.—died May 17, 1996, Alexandria, Virginia) American radio broadcaster and jazz promoter who was the longtime host of the Music USA program on the Voice of America (VOA). His voice was perhaps the best known overseas of any American of his era.
After winning a talent contest while a university student, Conover became a jazz disc jockey in Washington, D.C., during World War II. He was invited to work for the VOA in 1955, during the Cold War, and his nightly programs—which featured a mix of jazz styles, from Dixieland through bebop to the avant-garde—immediately found enormous success, especially in eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and Asia. He scrupulously averted any attempts to politicize his show, and he never held a staff position with the U.S. government radio station, preferring to work on a freelance basis for more than 40 years. Still, Conover viewed jazz as a lever to promote racial equality and harmony in the United States and abroad, and, early in his career as a concert promoter, he was instrumental in helping desegregate Washington nightclubs. Later, through interviews and airplay, he promoted such talented young musicians as Polish pianist Adam Makowicz and South African singer Miriam Makeba.
