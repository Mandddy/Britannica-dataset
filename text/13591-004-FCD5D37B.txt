Mark Akenside,  (born Nov. 9, 1721, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, Eng.—died  June 23, 1770, London) poet and physician, best known for his poem The Pleasures of Imagination, an eclectic philosophical essay that takes as its starting point papers on the same subject written by Joseph Addison for The Spectator. Written in blank verse derived from Milton’s, it was modelled (as its preface states) on the Roman poets Virgil (the Georgics) and Horace (the Epistles). A debt to Virgil is certainly apparent in the way in which Akenside invests an essentially unpoetic subject—the abstractions of philosophic thought—with poetic form, through studied elevation of language and with considerable grace. The influence of Horace is clear in the skillfully handled transitions from one theme to another and the tact with which the entire subject is treated.
Later adopting the ode as his favourite poetic form, Akenside was more than willing to consider himself the English Pindar, one of several aspects of his character that was satirized in Tobias Smollett’s novel The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle, in which Akenside appears as the physician in scenes set on the European continent.
