Milton Berle, original name Milton Berlinger   (born July 12, 1908, New York, New York, U.S.—died March 27, 2002, Los Angeles, California) American comedian who, as a popular entertainer in the early days of television in the United States, came to be known as “Mr. Television.”
Berle first appeared on the vaudeville stage at age 10. With his mother’s encouragement, he continued in vaudeville throughout his youth, and he also acted in more than 50 silent films. He attended a school for professional children and soon began to perform as a master of ceremonies, and in the legitimate theatre as a comedian. He was known for blatantly borrowing jokes and comic routines from other comedians. For a decade after 1939 Berle worked chiefly in nightclubs, at the same time vainly attempting to gain a radio audience. None of his radio programs lasted more than a year. He continued to appear in motion pictures, making 19 between 1937 and 1968, including Let’s Make Love (1960) and It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963).
