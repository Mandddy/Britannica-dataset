Edward Villella,  (born October 1, 1936, New York, New York, U.S.) American ballet dancer who was the founding artistic director (1986–2012) of the Miami City Ballet. As a dancer, he was one of the principal performers of the New York City Ballet, where he was noted for his powerful technique, particularly his soaring leaps and jumps.
Villella began dance training at age 10 and soon won a scholarship to the School of American Ballet. Later he entered New York City’s School of Performing Arts. After a four-year hiatus he joined the New York City Ballet in 1957 and became a soloist within a year. A notable interpreter of the dramatic title role in a revival of George Balanchine’s Prodigal Son (1960), Villella also appeared as the Faun in Jerome Robbins’s Afternoon of a Faun and created the roles of Oberon in A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1962) and Harlequin in Harlequinade (1965), both by Balanchine. He also excelled in the nonvirtuosic but deeply dynamic Watermill (1972), created for him by Robbins. He performed in a number of pas de deux with Patricia McBride for television.
