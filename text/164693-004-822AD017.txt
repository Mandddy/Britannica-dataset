Mycobacterium, genus of rod-shaped bacteria of the family Mycobacteriaceae (order Actinomycetales), the most important species of which, M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, cause tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively, in humans. M. bovis causes tuberculosis in cattle and in humans. Some mycobacteria are saprophytes (i.e., they live on decaying organic matter), and others are obligate parasites. Most are found in soil and water in a free-living form or in diseased tissue of animals. Streptomycin, rifampin, and species-specific antimicrobial agents have had some success in treating Mycobacterium infections.
