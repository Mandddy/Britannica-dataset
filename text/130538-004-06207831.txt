Maranhão, estado (state) of northern Brazil, situated south of the Equator and to the southeast of the Amazon River basin. About two-thirds of its area consists of a low, heavily wooded region, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north. To the east and southeast lies Piauí state, and to the west lie the states of Tocantins and Pará.
The higher plateaus in the southern section of the state are northeastern extensions of the Brazilian Highlands; the highest point, the Serra da Cinta, is 4,373 feet (1,333 metres) in elevation. From these highlands a number of river systems run generally northeastward into the Atlantic. Several of them form a delta region around the capital city of São Luís, which stands on an island. The delta is bounded to the west by dense mangrove forests and to the east by areas of quicksand. The rivers in the state are navigable for much of their course, cutting through arable soils that support farming and cattle raising, the economic mainstays of Maranhão. The climate is hot and moist. There is a wet and a relatively dry season but never a rainless one.
