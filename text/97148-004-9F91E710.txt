William O. Douglas, in full William Orville Douglas  (born October 16, 1898, Maine, Minnesota, U.S.â€”died January 19, 1980, Washington, D.C.) public official, legal educator, and associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, best known for his consistent and outspoken defense of civil liberties. His 36 1/2 years of service on the Supreme Court constituted the longest tenure in U.S. history.
The son of a Presbyterian minister, Douglas moved with his family first to California and then to Washington. His father died when William was a small child, and his mother then settled the family in Yakima, Washington. Although Douglas contracted polio as a youth, he escaped permanent paralysis and developed what would become a lifelong love of the outdoors through his self-imposed regimen of exercise during recovery.
