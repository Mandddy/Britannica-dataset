Moktar Ould Daddah,  (born December 25, 1924, Boutilimit, Mauritania, French West Africa—died October 14, 2003, Paris, France) statesman who was independent Mauritania’s first president (1961–78). He was noted for his progress in unifying his ethnically mixed, dispersed, and partly nomadic people under his authoritarian but enlightened rule.
Of aristocratic background, Moktar Ould Daddah was the first Mauritanian to graduate from a university and to become a lawyer. When he returned from Paris in the mid-1950s, he joined the more moderate of two rival parties, the Progressive Mauritanian Union, and in 1957 was elected to the territorial assembly. By 1958 he was president of the Executive Council and the natural choice for prime minister in 1959 and president in 1961 after Mauritania attained independence. Meanwhile, in 1958 he had established a new unity party, the Mauritanian Regrouping Party, which in 1960 incorporated the chief remaining opposition party.
