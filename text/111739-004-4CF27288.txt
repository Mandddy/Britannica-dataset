The Ink Spots, American vocal group prominent in the late 1930s and ’40s. One of the first African-American groups, along with the Mills Brothers, to reach both black and white audiences, the Ink Spots exerted great influence on the development of the doo-wop vocal style. The principal members were Orville (“Hoppy”) Jones (b. Feb. 17, 1905, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—d. Oct. 18, 1944, New York, N.Y.), Charles Fuqua (d. 1971), Ivory (“Deek”) Watson (b. 1913, Indianapolis, Ind.—d. Nov. 4. 1969), Bill Kenny (b. 1915, Philadelphia, Pa.—d. March 23, 1978), Jerry Daniels (b. 1916, Indianapolis—d. Nov. 7, 1995, Indianapolis), Herb Kenny (b. 1915, Philadelphia—d. July 11, 1992, Columbia, Md.), and Billy Bowen (b. 1912, Birmingham, Ala.—d. 1982).
Formed in 1932 as the King, Jack and the Jesters, the group became the Ink Spots when they relocated to New York City. After Herb Kenny replaced original member Daniels, the group began a slow evolution toward its distinctive sound. In 1939 the Ink Spots scored a huge hit with “If I Didn’t Care,” on which Bill Kenny’s tenor lead contrasted with Jones’s deep bass. In establishing the prominence of the high tenor lead and adding spoken bass choruses to the backing harmonies, the Ink Spots laid the groundwork for countless doo-wop and rhythm-and-blues vocal groups, from the Ravens and the Orioles to Motown’s Temptations. Among their many hits in the 1940s were “Address Unknown,” “My Prayer” (later rerecorded by the Platters), “Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall” (a collaboration with Ella Fitzgerald), “We Three,” “To Each His Own,” and “The Gypsy.” In the early 1950s the group split into two, and multiple incarnations of the Ink Spots continued to perform through the 1990s. The Ink Spots were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
