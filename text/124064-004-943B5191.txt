Candlepins,  bowling game played on a standard tenpin lane with slender, cylindrical pins about 15 inches (38 cm) tall and tapered at both ends. The ball is 4.5 inches in diameter and 2 pounds 7 ounces (1.1 kg) in weight. Three balls are bowled in a frame (box), as in duckpins, but pins knocked down (deadwood) are not removed until the frame is completed. Scoring is roughly the same as in duckpins.
