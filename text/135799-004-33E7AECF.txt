Yaroslav I, byname Yaroslav The Wise, Russian Yaroslav Mudry  (born 980—died  Feb. 2, 1054) grand prince of Kiev from 1019 to 1054.
A son of the grand prince Vladimir, he was vice-regent of Novgorod at the time of his father’s death in 1015. Then his eldest surviving brother, Svyatopolk the Accursed, killed three of his other brothers and seized power in Kiev. Yaroslav, with the active support of the Novgorodians and the help of Varangian (Viking) mercenaries, defeated Svyatopolk and became the grand prince of Kiev in 1019.
