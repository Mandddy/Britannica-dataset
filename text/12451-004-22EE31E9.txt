Walter Damrosch, in full Walter Johannes Damrosch  (born Jan. 30, 1862, Breslau, Prussia [now Wrocław, Pol.]—died Dec. 22, 1950, New York, N.Y., U.S.) Prussian-born American orchestral conductor and composer whose activities spanned more than half a century of American musical life.
Damrosch studied with his father, Leopold Damrosch (1832–85), German violinist and conductor, who settled in New York City in 1871. Upon his father’s death in 1885, Walter Damrosch assumed the conductorship of the New York Symphony Society and the Oratorio Society of New York, founded by his father, and also conducted at the Metropolitan Opera Company (from 1885 to 1891). In 1898 his brother Frank Damrosch (1853–1937) took over as conductor of the Oratorio Society of New York. Later, Walter Damrosch organized the Damrosch Opera Company (1894–1900), specializing in German operas. In 1903 he reorganized the New York Symphony Society and conducted it until 1927, when it was combined with the Philharmonic Society.
