Vissarion Grigoryevich Belinsky,  (born May 30 [June 11, New Style], 1811, Sveaborg, Fin., Russian Empire—died  May 26 [June 7], 1848, St. Petersburg, Russia) eminent Russian literary critic who is often called the “father” of the Russian radical intelligentsia.
The son of a provincial doctor, Belinsky was expelled from the University of Moscow (1832) and earned his living thereafter as a journalist. His first substantial critical articles were part of a series that he wrote for the journal Teleskop (“Telescope”) beginning in 1834. These were called “Literaturnye mechtaniya” (“Literary Reveries”), and they established his reputation. In them he expounded F.W.J. Schelling’s Romantic view of national character, applying it to Russian culture.
