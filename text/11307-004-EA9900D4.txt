Hachiman, (
        Japanese: Eight Banners) one of the most popular Shintō deities of Japan; the patron deity of the Minamoto clan and of warriors in general; often referred to as the god of war. Hachiman is commonly regarded as the deification of Ōjin, the 15th emperor of Japan. He is seldom worshipped alone, however, and Hachiman shrines are most frequently dedicated to three deities: Hachiman as Ōjin, his mother the empress Jingō, and the goddess Hime-gami.
The first shrine dedicated to Hachiman, the Usa Hachiman-gū in Ōita Prefecture, was established in ad 725. The deity is immensely popular throughout Japan, and half the registered Shintō shrines are estimated to be dedicated to him. During the Nara period (ad 710–784) Hachiman was accepted as a Buddhist divinity and came to be known as Hachiman Daibosatsu (Great Buddha-to-be). As the first Japanese divinity to be given the title Daibosatsu, Hachiman is a significant figure in Japanese mythology, exemplifying the blending of indigenous and foreign elements. He was consulted as an oracle before the building of the colossal Buddha image at Tōdai temple and, as guardian deity of Tōdai temple, has his own shrine within the temple compound.
