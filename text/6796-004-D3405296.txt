Stanislas-Jean, chevalier de Boufflers,  (born May 31, 1738, Nancy, France—died January 18, 1815, Paris) French writer, soldier, and academician remembered chiefly for his picaresque romance, Aline, reine de Golconde (“Aline, Queen of Golconde”).
His mother, the Marquise de Boufflers, became the mistress of Stanisław Leszczyński, king Stanisław I of Poland and duke of Lorraine, and brought her son up at the ducal court at Lunéville. The boy was destined for a career in the church but proved temperamentally unsuited, and, while studying theology at Saint-Sulpice in Paris, he wrote his masterwork, Aline, a charming tale of a milkmaid who, after a series of improper adventures, becomes queen of Golconda. The story won its author immediate fame but caused his expulsion from Saint-Sulpice.
