Black Volta River, French Volta Noire, also called (in Burkina Faso) Mouhoun,  river in Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta), Ghana, and Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), headstream of the Volta River in western Africa. It rises as the Baoulé in low hills in southwestern Burkina Faso near Bobo Dioulasso, and at the end of its course it empties into Lake Volta (in Ghana), a large artificial reservoir created by the Volta River Project and stretching to just above the former confluence of the Black Volta and White Volta rivers.
From its source in Burkina Faso the Black Volta flows roughly north and east for about 200 miles (320 km) and then turns to flow south for 340 miles (550 km), forming the border between Ghana and Burkina Faso and then between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. At Bamboi, Ghana, it turns again, first north and then east, and approximately 80 miles (130 km) farther east it empties into Lake Volta, after a course of about 720 miles (1,160 km). Its gradient is relatively gentle (about 2 feet per mile [40 cm per km]), and the rainfall in its river valley is likewise small (for that part of the world). The Black Volta may stop flowing in the height of the dry season, but between Bamboi and the Côte d’Ivoire border the river’s regime has permitted construction of a dam. The principal riparian town is Lawra in Ghana; there is a ferry at Bamboi.
