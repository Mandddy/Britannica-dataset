Sigrid Undset,  (born May 20, 1882, Kalundborg, Denmark—died June 10, 1949, Lillehammer, Norway) Norwegian novelist who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928.
Her father was an archaeologist, and her home life was steeped in legend, folklore, and the history of Norway. Both this influence and her own life story are constantly present in her works—from Elleve aar (1934; Eleven Years), in which she tells of her childhood, to the story of her flight from Nazi-occupied Norway, published originally in English as Return to the Future (1942; Norwegian Tillbake til fremtiden).
