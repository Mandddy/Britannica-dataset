Kenneth Harry Clarke,  (born July 2, 1940, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England) British Conservative politician who served as a cabinet official in the governments of Margaret Thatcher, John Major, and David Cameron, including as Major’s chancellor of the Exchequer (1993–97) and as Cameron’s lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice (2010–12). He also served as a minister without portfolio (2012–14) in Cameron’s cabinet. A major figure in the Conservative Party for several decades, he unsuccessfully ran for leadership of the party on several occasions.
In the 1960s Clarke was one of a group of University of Cambridge undergraduates, including Michael Howard, who became close friends and rose to positions of prominence. Clarke subsequently became a barrister (1963) before entering the House of Commons in 1970 as member for Rushcliffe, near Nottingham. He quickly established himself on the liberal, pro-European wing of the Conservative Party and was a junior whip in the government of Edward Heath. Although at odds on some issues with Margaret Thatcher, when she became prime minister in 1979 Clarke was immediately given a junior government post, working for a friend from his student days, Norman Fowler, at the Ministry of Transport.
