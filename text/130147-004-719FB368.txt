Swazi, Bantu-speaking people inhabiting the tree-studded grasslands of Swaziland, the neighbouring Mpumalanga province of South Africa, and Mozambique. The Swazi, who are chiefly agriculturists and pastoralists, numbered about 1,810,000 in the late 20th century. The language of the Swazi, called Swati or Swazi, belongs to the Benue-Congo group of the Niger-Congo languages; with the Zulu and the Xhosa, the Swazi form the southern Nguni ethnolinguistic group.
In Swazi culture the highest traditional political, economic, and ritual powers are shared between a hereditary male ruler and his mother or a mother substitute who holds the official position of Queen Mother. Polygyny is the traditional ideal, each marriage involving the payment of a bride-price. The kingâ€™s wives and children are settled in royal villages, diplomatically dispersed throughout the territory. In Swaziland many national officials are drawn from dominant clans, but a balance is maintained in central and local government between this aristocratic element and representatives of commoners. In South Africa a system of regional authorities is subdivided into tribal authorities, each of which has its own chief. Cutting through local and kinship bonds is a system that classifies men by age groups, reorganized every five to seven years, and that requires of them labour and other services. Among non-Christians, beliefs in magic and witchcraft are combined with a highly organized ancestral cult.
