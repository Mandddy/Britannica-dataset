Saint Damasus I,  (born c. 304, Rome—died  Dec. 11, 384, Rome; feast day December 11) pope from Oct. 1, 366, to Dec. 11, 384. During his rule the primacy of the Roman see was asserted.
Damasus was a deacon during the reign of his predecessor, Pope Liberius, and accompanied him when Liberius was exiled by the Roman emperor Constantius for his opposition to Arianism, a belief that denied Christ’s divinity. Later, however, Damasus returned to Rome and acknowledged Antipope Felix II, a pro-Arian placed on the papal throne by the emperor. After Felix’ death (Nov. 22, 365), Damasus became reconciled with Liberius, but the enemies he made during this period of shifting allegiance troubled his entire pontificate. The election of Damasus as pope was immediately challenged by a minority who supported a rival claimant, Ursinus. The civil authority sided with Damasus, and Ursinus and his partisans were banished.
