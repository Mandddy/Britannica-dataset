Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar,  (born c. 1465, Cuéllar, Spain—died 1524, Santiago de Cuba, Cuba) conquistador and first Spanish governor of Cuba.
Velázquez sailed to the New World in 1493 on the second voyage of Christopher Columbus. Columbus’ eldest son, Diego Columbus, later entrusted Velázquez with the conquest of Cuba under the title of adelantado (governor) and, with Hernán Cortés, Velázquez departed for Cuba in 1511. In the next four years he founded the settlements of Baracoa, Bayamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Havana (La Habana). After his conquests were completed about 1514, he encouraged colonization and became governor of Cuba.
