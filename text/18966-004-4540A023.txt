Alfonso X, byname Alfonso the Wise, or the Learned, Spanish Alfonso el Sabio  (born November 23, 1221, Burgos, Castile [Spain]—died April 4, 1284, Sevilla) king of Castile and Leon from 1252 to 1284.
Alfonso’s father, Ferdinand III, conquered Andalusia and imposed tribute on the remaining Muslim states in Spain—Murcia and Granada. His mother, Beatrice, was granddaughter of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick I. Alfonso, already known as a scholar, became king in 1252. He had many scholars in his traveling court, and he was an active participant in their writing and editing. Some were experts on Roman law, which Alfonso hoped to make the basis of a uniform code for his lands. The court, gifts to friends, and foreign intrigue proved expensive, and Alfonso taxed heavily.
