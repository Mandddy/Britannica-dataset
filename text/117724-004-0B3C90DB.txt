Tea ceremony, Japanese chadō or sadō (“way of tea”) or cha-no-yu (“hot-water tea”),  time-honoured institution in Japan, rooted in the principles of Zen Buddhism and founded upon the reverence of the beautiful in the daily routine of life. It is an aesthetic way of welcoming guests, in which everything is done according to an established order.
The ceremony takes place in a tea house (cha-shitsu), which ideally is a small structure detached from the main house but which is often simply a special room of the house. Great care is taken in the choice of materials for and construction of the cha-shitsu so as to give it a sense of rustic yet refined simplicity. The room is usually about 3 m (9 feet) square or smaller; at one end there is an alcove, called the tokonoma, in which is displayed a hanging scroll, a flower arrangement, or both. The room also contains a small sunken fireplace (ro) that is used in the winter months for heating the tea kettle; in the summer a portable brazier is used. The cha-shitsu is entered through a small, low door, which is designed to suggest humility.
