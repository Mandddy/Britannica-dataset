Frances E.W. Harper, in full Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, née Frances Ella Watkins  (born September 24, 1825, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.—died February 22, 1911, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) American author, orator, and social reformer who was notable for her poetry, speeches, and essays on abolitionism, temperance, and woman suffrage.
Frances Watkins was the daughter of free black parents. She grew up in the home of an uncle whose school for black children she attended. At age 13 she went to work as a domestic in a Baltimore, Maryland, household but continued her education on her own. About 1845 she published a collection of verses and prose writings under the title Forest Leaves. During 1850–52 she taught sewing at Union Seminary, a work-study school operated by the African Methodist Episcopal Church near Columbus, Ohio. Later she taught in Little York, Pennsylvania. The rising heat of the abolitionist controversy and the consequent increasing stringency of slave laws in Southern and border states at length drew her into the public arena.
