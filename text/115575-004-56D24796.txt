S. Weir Mitchell, in full Silas Weir Mitchell   (born Feb. 15, 1829, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Jan. 4, 1914, Philadelphia) American physician and author who excelled in novels of psychology and historical romance.
After study at the University of Pennsylvania and Jefferson Medical College (M.D., 1850), Mitchell spent a year in Paris specializing in neurology. As an army surgeon during the American Civil War, he became well known for his “rest cure.” His war experiences were the basis for “The Case of George Dedlow” (1866), a story about a quadruple amputee notable for its psychological insights and realistic war scenes. He wrote some 170 medical monographs on topics ranging from snake venom to neurasthenia and published short stories, poems, and children’s stories anonymously. Of later novels perhaps his most notable are: Roland Blake (1886), Hugh Wynne (1898), The Adventures of François (1898), Circumstance (1901), Constance Trescott (1905), and The Red City (1908).
