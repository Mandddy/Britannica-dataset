Qi Baishi, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’i Pai-shih, original name Qi Chunzhi, also called Qi Huang  (born November 22, 1863, Xiangtan, Hunan province, China—died September 16, 1957, Beijing) with Zhang Daqian, one of the last of the great traditional Chinese painters.
Qi was of humble origins, and it was largely through his own efforts that he became adept at the arts of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He was active to the end of his long life and served as head of the Beijing Institute of Chinese Painting. His prodigious output reflects a diversity of interests and experience, generally focusing on the smaller things of the world rather than the large landscape, and he continued the styles of 17th- and 18th-century Individualists such as Shitao and Zhu Da. Fish, shrimp, crabs, and frogs were his favourite subjects. He was most accomplished at simple, freely sketched compositions, but he could also successfully execute a meticulous style. Using heavy ink, bright colours, and vigorous strokes, he created works of a fresh and lively manner that expressed his love of nature and life. In 1955 he was honoured with the International Peace Award.
