Metalogic, the study and analysis of the semantics (relations between expressions and meanings) and syntax (relations among expressions) of formal languages and formal systems. It is related to, but does not include, the formal treatment of natural languages. (For a discussion of the syntax and semantics of natural languages, see linguistics and semantics.)
A formal language usually requires a set of formation rules—i.e., a complete specification of the kinds of expressions that shall count as well-formed formulas (sentences or meaningful expressions), applicable mechanically, in the sense that a machine could check whether a candidate satisfies the requirements. This specification usually contains three parts: (1) a list of primitive symbols (basic units) given mechanically, (2) certain combinations of these symbols, singled out mechanically as forming the simple (atomic) sentences, and (3) a set of inductive clauses—inductive inasmuch as they stipulate that natural combinations of given sentences formed by such logical connectives as the disjunction “or,” which is symbolized “∨”; “not,” symbolized “∼”; and “for all ,” symbolized “(∀),” are again sentences. [“(∀)” is called a quantifier, as is also “there is some ,” symbolized “(∃)”.] Since these specifications are concerned only with symbols and their combinations and not with meanings, they involve only the syntax of the language.
