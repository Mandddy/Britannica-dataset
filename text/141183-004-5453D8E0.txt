Camarasaurus (genus Camarasaurus), a group of dinosaurs that lived during the Late Jurassic Period (161 million to 146 million years ago), fossils of which are found in western North America; they are among the most commonly found of all sauropod remains.
Camarasaurs grew to a length of about 18 metres (59 feet) and were somewhat smaller than other sauropods of the time such as diplodocids and brachiosaurs. Camarasaurs were further distinguished by their shorter necks and tails, shorter, snubnosed skulls, and large spoon-shaped teeth. The nostrils were positioned in front of the eyesâ€”not above the eyes as in brachiosaurs, or at the tip of the snout as in the diplodocids.
