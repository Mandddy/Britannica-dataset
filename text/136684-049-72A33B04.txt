Burma Road, highway linking Lashio, in eastern Burma (now Myanmar), with Kunming, in Yunnan province, China, a distance of 1,154 km (717 miles). The Chinese began construction of the road after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and the occupation of the seacoast of China by the Japanese. Completed in 1939, it functioned for three years as a vital supply route to the interior of China from the outside world, carrying war goods transported by sea to Rangoon (Yangon) and then by train to the Lashio railhead. In April 1942, however, the Japanese overran Burma, seized Lashio, and thus closed the road at its source. In 1944, as Allied forces from Assam in eastern India advanced into northern Burma, they constructed a supply road from Ledo, which finally connected with the Burma Road at a point still in Chinese hands. This road, known as the Stilwell Road or (until its completion) the Ledo Road, was opened in January 1945. Although the importance of the Burma Road diminished after World War II, it remains a link in a 3,400-km (2,100-mile) road system extending from Yangon to Chongqing, China.
