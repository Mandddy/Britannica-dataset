Kraftwerk, German experimental group widely regarded as the godfathers of electronic pop music. The original members were Ralf Hütter (b. 1946, Krefeld, West Germany) and Florian Schneider (b. 1947, Düsseldorf, West Germany). 
Hütter and Schneider met while studying classical music at Düsseldorf Conservatory in the late 1960s, and their early work with a five-piece band called the Organisation showed the influence of the German keyboard band Tangerine Dream. Adopting the name Kraftwerk (“power plant”), Hütter, Schneider, and a series of collaborators forged an austere sound and image as part of a small but highly influential cult of German bands who experimented with electronic instruments long before it was fashionable. The movement, dubbed “Krautrock” by British journalists, also included innovative bands such as Can, Faust, and Neu!, but Kraftwerk became the best known.
