The Wolf Man, American horror film, released in 1941, that made Lon Chaney, Jr., son of legendary silent film star Lon Chaney, a Hollywood celebrity in his own right. The film, one of the many popular monster movies of the 1930s and ’40s produced by Universal Pictures, greatly influenced popular conceptions of werewolves and lycanthropy.
After learning of his brother’s death, Larry Talbot (played by Chaney) returns to his ancestral home to make peace with his father, Sir John (Claude Rains). Talbot buys a silver cane decorated with a wolf in a local antique shop, and he later uses that walking stick to fend off an attack by a wolf. Though the animal is killed, it bites Talbot during the struggle. The beast turns out to be a werewolf who was a local Rom (gypsy) named Bela (Bela Lugosi). Through his bite he passes on to Talbot the curse of lycanthropy, and Talbot later transforms into a werewolf and kills an innocent man. After attempting to confide in his father, Talbot persuades Sir John to tie him up for the night so he does not harm anyone else. However, Talbot, as the Wolf Man, breaks free, and he is finally killed—beaten with his own cane by his father, who watches in horror as the Wolf Man’s body transforms back into human form.
