Georges Claude,  (born Sept. 24, 1870, Paris, Franceâ€”died  May 23, 1960, Saint-Cloud) engineer, chemist, and inventor of the neon light, which found widespread use in signs and was the forerunner of the fluorescent light.
In 1897 Claude discovered that acetylene gas could be transported safely by dissolving it in acetone. His method was generally adopted and brought a wide expansion to the acetylene industry. Independently of the German chemist Carl von Linde, he developed a process for producing liquefied air in quantity (1902). Although he proposed the use of liquid oxygen in iron smelting as early as 1910, his suggestion was not adopted until after World War II.
