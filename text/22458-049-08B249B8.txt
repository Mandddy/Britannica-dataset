Triggerfish, any of about 30 species of shallow-water marine fishes of the family Balistidae, found worldwide in tropical seas. Triggerfishes are rather deep-bodied, usually colourful fishes with large scales, small mouths, and high-set eyes. Their common name refers to the triggering mechanism in the first two of their three dorsal fin spines. The first spine can be erected by the fish and locked in place by the second, the trigger, which must be withdrawn before the first spine is released. The first spine is large and strong and, when locked upright, can hold the fish tightly in protective crevices.
Triggerfishes are found among reefs and marine plants. Although generally considered edible, some cause food poisoning. The largest triggerfishes grow about 60 cm (2 feet) long. Common species include the queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), a tropical Atlantic fish brightly striped with blue, and Rhinecanthus aculeatus, a grayish, Indo-Pacific fish patterned with bands of blue, black, orange, and white.
