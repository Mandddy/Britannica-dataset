Owen Wister,  (born July 14, 1860, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.â€”died July 21, 1938, North Kingstown, Rhode Island) American novelist whose novel The Virginian (1902) helped establish the cowboy as a folk hero in the United States and the western as a legitimate genre of literature. The Virginian is the prototypical western novel and, arguably, the work most responsible for the romanticized view of the West that is an important part of American cultural identity.
Wister was an unlikely champion of the American West. He was born into privilege, to an Eastern family of considerable means. His father was an affluent doctor and his mother one of the daughters of famous English actress Fanny Kemble. He also had ties to the aristocracy of the American South; his great-grandfather was Pierce Butler, a delegate from South Carolina to the Constitutional Convention (1787).
