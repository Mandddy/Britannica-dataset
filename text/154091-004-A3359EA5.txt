Jordan River, Arabic Nahr Al-Urdun, Hebrew Ha-Yarden,  river of southwestern Asia, in the Middle East region. It lies in a structural depression and has the lowest elevation of any river in the world.
The river rises on the slopes of Mount Hermon, on the border between Syria and Lebanon, and flows southward through northern Israel to the Sea of Galilee (Lake Tiberius). Exiting the sea, it continues south, dividing Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank to the west from Jordan to the east before emptying into the Dead Sea. The surface of the Dead Sea, at an elevation of about 1,410 feet (430 metres) below sea level in the mid-2010s, is the lowest land point on Earth.
