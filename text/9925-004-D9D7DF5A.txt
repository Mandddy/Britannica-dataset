Moropus,  extinct genus of the chalicotheres, a group of very unusual perissodactyls (“odd-toed” ungulates) related to the horse. Fossil remains of Moropus are found in Miocene deposits in North America and Asia (the Miocene Epoch lasted from 23.7 to 5.3 million years ago). Moropus was as large as a modern horse, but, unlike other perissodactyls, it had claws instead of hoofs. The forelimbs were longer than the hind limbs, and the back sloped downward to the hindquarters. The teeth possessed low crowns; the molars were large and the premolars small. It is likely that Moropus did not browse or graze as did other horselike forms but instead probably used its large claws to dig up roots and tubers more suited to its type of dentition than grasses.
