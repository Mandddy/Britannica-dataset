Millstone,  one of a pair of flat, round stones used for grinding grain. One millstone is stationary; the other rotates above it in a horizontal plane. Grain is poured through a hole in the centre of the rotating millstone, flowing into shallow grooves, called channels, which radiate from the centre of the stationary millstone. The channels lead the grain onto the flat grinding section, called the land, and to the edge, where it emerges as flour. Sharpening a millstone consists of recarving worn channels and checking and smoothing the land.
The best millstones are made from French buhrstone, quarried near Paris. In the United States, where there is no buhrstone, quartz conglomerate, quartzite, sandstone, or granite is substituted.
