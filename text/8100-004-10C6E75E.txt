Clumber spaniel, breed of sporting dog, the heaviest of the spaniel family, said to have originated in France before the French Revolution. The breed takes its name from Clumber Park in Nottingham, England, then the seat of the dukes of Newcastle. Developed by the British, the Clumber spaniel became a favourite of royalty, including Prince Albert, Edward VII, and George V. A low-slung, long-bodied, heavy-boned, powerful dog with large feet, a deep chest, a large, square head, and hanging ears, it is slow but thorough in the field, trailing and retrieving well in rough country. It stands 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) and weighs 55 to 85 pounds (25 to 38 kg). The silky, straight, dense coat is white, with lemon or orange markings and freckles; the legs and chest are feathered. It has a tranquil and affectionate disposition.
