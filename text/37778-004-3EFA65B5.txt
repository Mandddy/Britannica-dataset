Johann Adam Möhler,  (born May 6, 1796, Igersheim, Würzburg [Germany]—died  April 12, 1838, Munich) German Roman Catholic church historian whose theories on and efforts toward uniting the Catholic and Protestant churches made him an important source of ideas for the ecumenical movement of the 20th century.
Ordained priest in 1819, Möhler taught church history at the German universities of Tübingen (1826–35) and Munich (1835–38). One of his outstanding books is Symbolik (“On the Creeds”), first published in 1832. In this work, as in his earlier volume Die Einheit in der Kirche (1825; “Unity in the Church”), Möhler argued that man’s journey to God could be made only in the church founded by Christ. He sympathized with Protestantism, and his longing for church unity induced him to tour key universities in Germany and Austria and to engage in discourses with contemporary Protestant scholars. His hope that a mutual understanding between Protestants and Roman Catholics would bring about an undivided church has inspired modern ecclesiastics. His other works include Neue Untersuchung der Lehrgegensätze zwischen Katholiken und Protestanten (1834; “New Examination of the Doctrinal Differences Between Catholics and Protestants”) and lives of Saints Athanasius the Great and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury.
