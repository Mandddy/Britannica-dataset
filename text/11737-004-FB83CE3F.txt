Finnish literature, the oral and written literature produced in Finland in the Finnish, Swedish, and, during the Middle Ages, Latin languages.
The history of Finnish literature and that of Swedish literature are intertwined. From the mid-12th century until 1809, Finland was ruled by Sweden, and Swedish remained the language of the upper classes until the end of the 19th century, at which time a vigorous movement began to revive Finnish as a cultural medium. This article discusses works written in Finland both in the Swedish language (Finland-Swedish literature) and in the Finnish language. It also discusses works by Finnish writers in exile in Sweden.
