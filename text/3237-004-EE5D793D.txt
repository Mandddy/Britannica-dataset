Opossum shrimp, also called possum shrimp or mysids,  any member of the crustacean order Mysidacea. Most of the nearly 1,000 known species live in the sea; a few live in brackish water; and fewer still live in fresh water. Most are 1 to 3 cm (about 0.4 to 1.2 inches) long. The name opossum shrimp derives from the femalesâ€™ brood pouch, in which embryos spend several weeks.
Most mysids live in cold water, often at great depths. Some burrow into or crawl along the bottom; others creep among vegetation. Certain species swim in the open water, occasionally forming swarms consisting of great numbers of individuals. The freshwater species Mysis relicta, which is common in cold lakes of North America, Great Britain, and northern Europe, is an important food for lake trout in the Great Lakes. Some species, such as Heteromysis cotti of the Canary Islands, live in caves and are either blind or have poorly developed eyes.
