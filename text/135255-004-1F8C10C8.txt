St. Nicholas Day, feast day (December 6) of St. Nicholas, patron saint of Russia and Greece, of a number of cities, and of sailors and children, among many other groups. Some countries celebrate St. Nicholas Day on December 5.
Little is known of the life of the historical Nicholas. He was the bishop of Myra (near Kale in southwestern Turkey) in the 4th century and developed a reputation for generosity. In 1087 Italians stole his remains from the church in Myra, by then under the control of Muslims, and took them to Bari for reburial, and during the Middle Ages he became extraordinarily popular. After the Reformation, St. Nicholas was largely forgotten in Protestant Europe, although his memory was kept alive in Holland as Sinterklaas. There St. Nicholas is said to arrive on horseback on his feast day, dressed in a bishopâ€™s red robe and mitre and accompanied by Black Peter (Zwarte Piet), variously described as a freed slave or a Moor, to help him distribute sweets and presents to good children or lumps of coal, potatoes, or switches to bad ones. The Dutch took the tradition to New Amsterdam (New York City), where he was transformed into Santa Claus. In Britain he was replaced with Father Christmas.
