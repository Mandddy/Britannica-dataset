After several seasons of acting in summer stock, she made her Broadway debut in November 1949 in August Strindberg’s The Father. She appeared in a number of television dramas in the early 1950s. Her first film role, a small one, was in Fourteen Hours (1951), but the next year she appeared as Gary Cooper’s Quaker wife in High Noon and her career began to blossom.
