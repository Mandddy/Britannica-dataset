André de Chénier,  (born Oct. 30, 1762, Istanbul—died  July 25, 1794, Paris) poet and political journalist, generally considered the greatest French poet of the 18th century. His work was scarcely published until 25 years after his death. When the first collected edition of Chénier’s poetry appeared in 1819, it had an immediate success and was acclaimed not only by the poets of the Romantic movement but also by the anti-Romantic liberal press. Not only was Chénier’s influence felt on poetic trends throughout the 19th century but the legend of his political struggle and heroic death—celebrated in Chateaubriand’s work Le Génie du christianisme (1802), Sainte-Beuve’s Joseph Delorme (1829), Vigny’s Stello (1832), and Umberto Giordano’s opera Andrea Chénier (1896)—also made him a European symbol of the poet-hero.
His mother was Greek, and he always had a deep affection for Classical literature, in particular for elegiac poetry. He was educated in the progressive Collège de Navarre and, after an unsuccessful attempt at a military career in 1782–83, devoted himself for five years to study. In 1787 he reluctantly accepted a post in the French embassy in London. He was obsessed at that time by epic themes, notably a project for a poem on the New World, but he was psychologically inhibited from completing these works. His years in London were unhappy: he suffered from frustrated ambition and from self-doubt.
