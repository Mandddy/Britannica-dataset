Thermit, also spelled Thermite,  powdered mixture used in incendiary bombs, in the reduction of metals from their oxides, and as a source of heat in welding iron and steel and in foundry work.
The powder consists of aluminum and the oxide of a metal such as iron. When ignited or heated, it gives off an enormous amount of heat as a result of the chemical combination of the aluminum with the oxygen of the oxide. The reaction temperature is estimated to be about 2,400° C (4,400° F).
