Space weather, conditions in space caused by the Sun that can affect satellites and technology on Earth as well as human life and health. As modern civilization has become more dependent on continent-sized electric power distribution grids, global satellite communication and navigation systems, and military and civilian satellite imaging, it has become more susceptible to the effects of space weather.
Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field that extends far out into space in a teardrop-shaped cavity called the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is compressed on the dayside and stretched out into a long “magnetotail” on the nightside by interaction with the solar wind. The solar wind is a flux of charged particles that flows at supersonic velocity from the Sun’s outer atmosphere (the corona) and carries with it the solar magnetic field. The solar wind and solar magnetic field (named the interplanetary magnetic field [IMF] when it is observed away from the Sun) expand throughout the entire solar system, extending to more than three times the distance of Neptune’s orbit before the solar wind is slowed by the interstellar medium. The cavity that contains the solar wind and the IMF is called the heliosphere; it is analogous to Earth’s magnetosphere.
