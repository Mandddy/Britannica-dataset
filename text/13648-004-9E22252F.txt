Theodicy, (from Greek theos, “god”; dikē, “justice”), explanation of why a perfectly good, almighty, and all-knowing God permits evil. The term literally means “justifying God.” Although many forms of theodicy have been proposed, some Christian thinkers have rejected as impious any attempt to fathom God’s purposes or to judge God’s actions by human standards. Others, drawing a distinction between a theodicy and a more limited “defense,” have sought to show only that the existence of some evil in the world is logically compatible with God’s omnipotence and perfect goodness. Theodicies and defenses are two forms of response to what is known in theology and philosophy as the problem of evil.
According to the English philosopher and theologian John Hick, Christian theology offers two main approaches to theodicy, one stemming from the work of St. Augustine (354–430), the other from that of St. Irenaeus (c. 120/140–c. 200/203). Augustine’s approach has been much more influential, but Hick finds the ideas of Irenaeus more in harmony with modern thought and likely to prove more fruitful.
