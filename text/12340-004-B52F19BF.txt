Diatom, any member of the algal class Bacillariophyceae (division Chromophyta), with about 16,000 species found in sediments or attached to solid substances in all the waters of the Earth. Diatoms may be either unicellular or colonial. The silicified cell wall forms a pillbox-like shell (frustule) composed of overlapping halves (epitheca and hypotheca) perforated by intricate and delicate patterns useful in testing the resolving power of microscope lenses.
During reproduction, usually by cell division, the overlapping shell halves separate, and each secretes a (usually) smaller bottom half. Thus, individual diatoms formed from successive bottom halves show a progressive decrease in size with each division. In a few months there can be as much as a 60 percent decrease in average size. Periodic spore formation serves to restore the diatom line to its original size.
