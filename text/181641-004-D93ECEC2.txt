Alexander, baron von Bach,  (born January 4, 1813—died 1893) Austrian politician noted for instituting a system of centralized control. He served as minister of the interior (1849–59); after the death of Felix, prince zu Schwarzenberg in 1852, he largely dictated policy in the regime. Bach centralized administrative authority for the Austrian Empire, but he also endorsed reactionary policies that reduced freedom of the press and abandoned public trials.
