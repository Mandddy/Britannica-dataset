Marvin Hamlisch, in full Marvin Frederick Hamlisch  (born June 2, 1944, New York, New York, U.S.—died August 6, 2012, Los Angeles, California) American composer, pianist, and conductor of remarkable versatility, admired especially for his scores for film and theatre. His stylistically diverse corpus encompasses instrumental adaptations of popular tunes, balladlike solo songs, and rock and disco music, as well as classically oriented orchestral compositions.
Encouraged by his father, who was an accordionist and immigrant from Austria, Hamlisch displayed prodigious musical ability as a young child. At age 6 he auditioned and was accepted to the Juilliard School, where he studied piano in the precollege program until 1965. He then enrolled in Queens College of the City University of New York, from which he received a bachelor’s degree in 1967.
