Roper River, river in Northern Territory, Australia, formed by the confluence of Waterhouse River and Beswick Creek east of Mataranka and flowing east for 250 miles (400 km) to Limmen Bight on the Gulf of Carpentaria. It marks the southern limit of the rugged region known as Arnhem Land. The flow of the river system, which drains an area of 23,500 square miles (60,860 square km), increases greatly during the summer. Its main tributaries include the Strangways, Hodgson, and Wilton rivers and Elsey and Flying Fox creeks. Many north-bank tributaries descend steep, narrow canyons from the Arnhem Land plateau.
The river, which is navigable for 100 miles (160 km) above its mouth, was visited in 1845 by the German explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, who named it for a member of his expedition. The Stuart Highway parallels 50 miles (80 km) of the river’s upper reaches. Ngukurr, a township 65 miles (105 km) from the gulf, has a school for Aborigines and produces mixed crops and cattle. North of the river’s mouth is the “Ruined City of Arnhem Land,” a region of sandstone whose weathered shapes suggest ruined buildings.
