Accretion disk, a disklike flow of gas, plasma, dust, or particles around any astronomical object in which the material orbiting in the gravitational field of the object loses energy and angular momentum as it slowly spirals inward. In astrophysics, the term accretion refers to the growth in mass of any celestial object due to its gravitational attraction. The formation of stars and planets and the powerful emissions from quasars, radio galaxies, X-ray binaries (see X-ray astronomy), and probably also Type Ia supernovas all involve accretion disks. The astronomical object whose mass is growing is known as the accretor.
An accretion disk forms whenever the matter being accreted possesses enough rotational or angular momentum that it cannot simply fall inward toward the accretor along a straight line. In directions perpendicular to the accretorâ€™s rotation axis, the flow tends to flatten onto a disk because the rotation resists the inflow of the material. In directions parallel to the rotation axis, the matter contracts toward a plane until the thermal pressure inside the disk roughly equals the gravitational force.
