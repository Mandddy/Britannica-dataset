Helen Gurley Brown, née Helen Gurley  (born February 18, 1922, Green Forest, Arkansas, U.S.—died August 13, 2012, New York City, New York) American writer and editor whose upbeat, stylish publications, beginning in the mid-20th century, emphasized sexual and career independence and adventure for a large audience of young women.
Helen Gurley was a student at Texas State College for Women (1939–41; now Texas Women’s University) and at Woodbury Business College (1942) before becoming a copywriter for the advertising firm of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding in 1948. Her ability to write bright, arresting prose enabled her to progress rapidly in that field, and she had already won two of her three Frances Holmes Advertising Copywriters awards when she transferred to the Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt agency as copywriter and account executive in 1958.
