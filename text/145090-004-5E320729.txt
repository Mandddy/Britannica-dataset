Elevated transit line,  railroad line, usually electric, raised above the ground or street level, usually on a trestle, for local transit in urban areas. By the mid-19th century it was evident that surface vehicles were inadequate for carrying the traffic of large cities. The first elevated was successfully operated in New York City in 1871, using steam power. Because steam power had many disadvantages, the lines were later electrified. In 1895 Chicago acquired the first electric line. An extensive network of elevated lines built in New York City was in service for many years but was systematically eliminated because of aesthetic shortcomings and because it contributed to traffic congestion. Chicago developed an extensive elevated system. Many cities in Europe—Berlin, Stockholm, Madrid, and others—have had one or more elevated lines.
