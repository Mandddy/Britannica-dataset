Hubert de Givenchy,  (born Feb. 21, 1927, Beauvais, France) French fashion designer noted for his couture and ready-to-wear designs, especially those he created for the actress Audrey Hepburn.
Givenchy studied art at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and later studied law. At 17 he was apprenticed to the Parisian designer Jacques Fath, but he did not remain with Fath for long; during the next eight years he designed for the major Parisian fashion houses of Robert Piguet, Lucien Lelong, and Elsa Schiaparelli, in turn. In 1952 he opened his own house and maintained very low overhead costs in order to lower the prices of his designs. Givenchy’s first collection, featuring flawlessly detailed separates, high-style coats, and elegant ball gowns, gained immediate international recognition. His designs used imaginative accessories, silk prints, and embroidered fabrics. His “Bettina blouse,” named for a popular model, reintroduced tailored shirting into high fashion.
