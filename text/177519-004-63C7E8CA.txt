Fire ant (genus Solenopsis), also called thief ant,  any of a genus of insects in the family Formicidae, order Hymenoptera, that occur in tropical regions of the world, such as Central and South America, and in some temperate regions, such as North America. The best-known member of the genus, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis saevissima, also known as S. invicta), was accidentally introduced into the United States from South America. The red or yellowish ants are one to five millimetres in length and can inflict a severe sting. The semipermanent nest consists of a loose mound with open craters for ventilation. The workers are notorious for damaging planted grain and attacking poultry. Fire ants communicate through chemical secretions and stridulation (sounds produced by rubbing or drumming one body part against another). While adult workers are known for their aggressive behaviour when under the threat of attack from neighbouring ant colonies, young fire ants, whose stingers and external skeletons are not yet fully developed, play dead.
