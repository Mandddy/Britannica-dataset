Thomas Midgley, Jr.,  (born May 18, 1889, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died November 2, 1944, Worthington, Ohio) American engineer and chemist who discovered the effectiveness of tetraethyl lead as an antiknock additive for gasoline. He also found that dichlorodifluoromethane (a type of fluorocarbon commercialized under the trade name Freon-12) could be used as a safe refrigerant.
The son of an immigrant inventor from London, Midgley grew up in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Columbus, Ohio. After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in mechanical engineering (1911), he worked in Dayton, Ohio, as a draftsman and designer at the National Cash Register Company (where only a few years earlier Charles F. Kettering had developed the first electric cash register) and then at his father’s automobile tire factory. In 1916 he went to work for Kettering, first in the research staff of the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco) and then for the Dayton Metals Products Company, and he stayed with the latter company after it became a research arm of the General Motors Corporation in 1919.
