Joseph Kony,  (born 1961?) Ugandan rebel who led the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), a militia that terrorized northern Uganda and neighbouring countries in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
Kony was reared in the village of Odek in northern Uganda. An ethnic Acholi, he served as an altar boy during his youth and was fond of dancing. He left school to become a traditional healer. When Yoweri Museveni seized power in Uganda in 1986 and became president, some Acholis revolted. A relative of Kony’s, spirit medium Alice Lakwena, led a rebel group called the Holy Spirit Movement, which was quashed by government troops as it advanced on Kampala, the capital. Kony joined another faction and in 1987 proclaimed himself a prophet for the Acholi people and took charge of the Holy Spirit Movement, which would eventually become the LRA. In its early years the LRA enjoyed support in northern Uganda, but as its resources diminished, the militia began to plunder the local population. The movement gained considerable strength in 1994 when it received the backing of the government of Sudan, which sought to retaliate against Kampala for its support of Sudanese rebels.
