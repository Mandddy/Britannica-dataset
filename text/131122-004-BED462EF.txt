Osmunda, fern genus of the family Osmundaceae, with divided fronds and often growing to a height of 1.5 metres (5 feet). The matted fibrous roots of these abundant ferns are called osmunda fibre, osmundine, or orchid peat; they are broken up and used as a rooting medium for epiphytic orchids (those that grow on other plants). The genus has a long fossil record, with some extant plants referred to as living fossils. In particular, ancient versions of O. cinnamomea, which is found in fossils from about 70 million years ago, and O. claytoniana, which is found in fossils from about 200 million years ago, are nearly identical to the modern versions.
