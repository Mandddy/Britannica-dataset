ROSAT, in full Röntgensatellit,  X-ray astronomy satellite launched on June 1, 1990, as part of a cooperative program involving Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
ROSAT had two parallel grazing-incidence telescopes. One of them, the X-ray telescope, bore many similarities to the equipment of the earlier satellite Einstein Observatory but had a larger geometric area and better mirror resolution. The other operated at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. A position-sensitive proportional counter made it possible to survey the sky at X-ray wavelengths and produced a catalog of more than 150,000 sources with a positional accuracy of better than 30 arc seconds. A wide-field camera with a 5°-diameter field of view that operated with the extreme ultraviolet telescope was also part of the ROSAT instrument package. It produced an extended ultraviolet survey with arc minute source positions in this wavelength region, making it the first instrument with such capability. The ROSAT mirrors were gold-coated and permitted detailed examination of the sky from 5 to 124 angstroms.
