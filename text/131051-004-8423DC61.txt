Leafbird, (genus Chloropsis), any of about 10 species of short-legged, grass-green birds (family Irenidae, order Passeriformes) from Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Some authorities place the leafbird in the bulbul family (Pycnonotidae).
Leafbirds are about 17 to 20 cm (6.5 to 8 inches) long. They live high up in the jungle canopy, feeding mainly on nectar, plus some insects and berries. They are excellent mimics, although often aggressive towards other birds. The loosely made cuplike nest may contain two to three cream-coloured eggs. The golden-fronted leafbird (C. aurifrons) is a popular cage bird.
