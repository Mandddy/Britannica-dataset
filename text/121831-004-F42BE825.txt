Threadfin, any of about 41 species of marine fishes of the family Polynemidae (order Perciformes), widely distributed along warm seashores, often over sand. Threadfins have two well-separated dorsal fins and a forked tail, and are usually silvery in colour. Their name refers to their pectoral fins, each of which is divided into an upper, normally shaped fin and a lower section consisting of four to seven long, threadlike rays that serve as sensory devices; they are especially long in the young. Most threadfins are 30–60 centimetres (1–2 feet) long; one species, Eleutheronema tetradactylum of India, grow to about 1.8 metres (6 feet) long.
The name threadfin, or threadfish, may also be applied to the cosmopolitan, warm-water, marine fishes of the genus Alectis (family Carangidae), which also have long, filamentous fin rays, but on the dorsal and anal, rather than pectoral, fins. These rays, also, are more pronounced in the young.
