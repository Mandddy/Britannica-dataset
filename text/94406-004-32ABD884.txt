San Juan, capital and largest city of Puerto Rico, located on the northern coast of the island, on the Atlantic Ocean. A major port and tourist resort of the West Indies, it is the oldest city now under U.S. jurisdiction. Originally, the settlement was known as Puerto Rico and the island as San Juan, but common usage over the centuries brought about a reversal of the names. Pop. (2000) 426,618; San Juan–Caguas–Guaynabo Metro Area, 2,509,007; (2010) 381,931; San Juan–Caguas–Guaynabo Metro Area, 2,478,905.
In 1508 the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León founded the original settlement, Caparra, on the almost landlocked harbour just to the west of the present metropolitan area. In 1521 the settlement was moved to a rocky islet at the harbour entrance. Casa Blanca (“White House”) was begun that same year and was owned by Ponce de León’s family until the late 18th century. In 1533 the Spanish began construction of massive fortifications in response to attacks by native Taino and by rival European powers. The bulwark-palace known as La Fortaleza, built near Casa Blanca, was the first of the new defenses (it now houses the governor’s mansion). San Felipe del Morro castle (also called El Morro) was constructed next, on a high bluff overlooking San Juan Bay.
