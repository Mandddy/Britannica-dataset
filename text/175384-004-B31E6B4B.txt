Dark Victory, American dramatic film, released in 1939, that was notable for Bette Davisâ€™s performance as a young woman coming to terms with her impending death.
Davis portrayed Judith Traherne, a spirited heiress suffering from a malignant brain tumour. Traherne undergoes surgery, but Dr. Frederick Steele (played by George Brent) is unable to completely remove the tumour. Rather than deliver the grim diagnosis, he tells her that the surgery was a success, and the two begin a romantic relationship. When Traherne discovers the truth about her condition, she makes a series of momentous and questionable decisions, including ending her engagement to Steele. However, she eventually realizes she is happiest with Steele, and they marry shortly before her death.
