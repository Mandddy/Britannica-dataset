Scorodite,  mineral in the variscite group, hydrated iron arsenate (FeAsO4Â·2H2O). It forms pale leek-green or grayish green to liver-brown aggregates of crystals, or pale green to pale grayish or brownish green earthy masses. Scorodite forms a continuous solid-solution series with mansfieldite in which aluminum replaces iron in the scorodite structure. Mansfieldite forms white to pale gray crusts and porous masses. These minerals occur in weathered zones formed by the oxidation of arsenopyrite. For detailed physical properties, see arsenate mineral (table).
