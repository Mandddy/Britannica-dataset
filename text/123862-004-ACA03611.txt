Glaze,  ice coating that forms when supercooled rain, drizzle, or fog drops strike surfaces that have temperatures at or below the freezing point; the accumulated water covers the surface and freezes relatively slowly. Glaze is denser (about 0.85 gram per cubic centimetre, or 54 pounds per cubic foot), harder, and more transparent than other forms of accumulated ice. Rime, a white or milky granular type of accumulated ice, forms when small supercooled droplets striking an object freeze quickly, trapping air bubbles in the ice. It has a density of about 0.25 gram per cubic centimetre (17 pounds per cubic foot).
