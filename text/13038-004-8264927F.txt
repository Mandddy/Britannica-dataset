Charles IX, also called (until 1560) duc (duke) d’Orléans  (born June 27, 1550, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris—died May 30, 1574, Vincennes, France) king of France from 1560, remembered for authorizing the massacre of Protestants on St. Bartholomew’s Day, August 23–24, 1572, on the advice of his mother, Catherine de Médicis.
The second son of Henry II and Catherine, Charles became king on the death of his brother Francis II, but his mother was regent. Proclaimed of age on August 17, 1563, after his 13th birthday (according to the custom of the kingdom), he remained under his mother’s domination, being incapable of choosing and following a policy of his own. His health was poor and he was mentally unstable.
