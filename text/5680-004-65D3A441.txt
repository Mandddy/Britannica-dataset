Ani,  any of three species of big-billed, glossy black birds of the genus Crotophaga of the cuckoo family (Cuculidae), of tropical America. These insect eaters forage on the ground in close and noisy flocks, often in fields with cattle. The bill is high-arched, bladelike, and hook-tipped; the tail is long and broad; the wings are short; and the plumage is floppy, so that the bird looks disheveled. Anis fly poorly and utter whining cries. They build a communal tree nest of twigs, in which several females may lay a total of 25 chalky-blue eggs (usually 10 to 15) and share duties of incubation and chick raising.
The common, or smooth-billed, ani (C. ani), found from southern Florida to Argentina, is a bird 36 cm (14 inches) long that looks like a huge-beaked grackle. The great ani (C. major) is common in swamplands of South America, chiefly east of the Andes. The groove-billed ani (C. sulcirostris), found from southern Texas to western Peru and northern Brazil, has several grooves in the upper mandible.
