Lady Bird Johnson, née Claudia Alta Taylor  (born Dec. 22, 1912, Karnack, Texas, U.S.—died July 11, 2007, Austin, Texas) American first lady (1963–69), the wife of Lyndon B. Johnson, 36th president of the United States, and an environmentalist noted for her emphasis on beautification.
The daughter of Thomas Jefferson Taylor, a prosperous businessman, and Minnie Patillo Taylor, Claudia Alta Taylor was nicknamed “Lady Bird” on the suggestion of a family nursemaid. After her mother’s death in 1918, Lady Bird was raised by an aunt who came to live with the family. Her childhood was very lonely, and she later noted that it was during these years that she developed her love of reading and her respect for the tranquillity of nature. Unusually bright, she attended local schools and graduated from high school at age 15; later she attended St. Mary’s Episcopal School for Girls in Dallas, Texas, where she pursued her interest in writing.
