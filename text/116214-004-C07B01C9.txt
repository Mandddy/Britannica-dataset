Romance, literary form, usually characterized by its treatment of chivalry, that came into being in France in the mid-12th century. It had antecedents in many prose works from classical antiquity (the so-called Greek romances), but as a distinctive genre it was developed in the context of the aristocratic courts of such patrons as Eleanor of Aquitaine.
The Old French word romanz originally meant “the speech of the people,” or “the vulgar tongue,” from a popular Latin word, Romanice, meaning written in the vernacular, in contrast with the written form of literary Latin. Its meaning then shifted from the language in which the work was written to the work itself. Thus, an adaptation of Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Historia regum Britanniae (1135–38), made by Wace of Jersey in 1155, was known as Li Romanz de Brut, while an anonymous adaptation (of slightly later date) of Virgil’s Aeneid was known as Li Romanz d’Enéas; it is difficult to tell whether in such cases li romanz still meant “the French version” or had already come to mean “the story.” It soon specialized in the latter sense, however, and was applied to narrative compositions similar in character to those imitated from Latin sources but totally different in origin; and, as the nature of these compositions changed, the word itself acquired an increasingly wide spectrum of meanings. In modern French a roman is just a novel, whatever its content and structure; while in modern English the word “romance” (derived from Old French romanz) can mean either a medieval narrative composition or a love affair, or, again, a story about a love affair, generally one of a rather idyllic or idealized type, sometimes marked by strange or unexpected incidents and developments; and “to romance” has come to mean “to make up a story that has no connection with reality.”
