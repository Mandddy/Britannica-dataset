Edouard van Beneden, in full Edouard-Joseph-Louis-Marie van Beneden  (born March 5, 1846, Leuven, Belg.—died  April 28, 1910, Liège) Belgian embryologist and cytologist best known for his discoveries concerning fertilization and chromosome numbers in sex cells and body cells.
During his early years, van Beneden worked with his father, P.J. van Beneden, a professor of zoology at the Catholic University in Leuven (Louvain), who was noted for his studies on protozoans, nematodes, and various other animal groups. The younger van Beneden extended this research to dicyemids, a group of wormlike organisms distinguished by their production of two types of embryo. In 1870 he was appointed to the faculty of the University of Liège, where he focused his research on comparative morphology. His work, for example, advanced the theory of the Russian zoologist Aleksandr O. Kovalevsky that marine organisms called tunicates were chordates. Van Beneden established the tunicates’ phylogenetic relationship to other animals through an investigation of the segmentation of the embryo.
