Nguyen Cao Ky,  (born September 8, 1930, Son Tay, northern Vietnam—died July 23, 2011, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) South Vietnamese military and political leader known for his flamboyant manner and militant policies.
A member of the French forces that opposed the Vietnamese liberation movement, Ky joined the South Vietnamese Air Force after the nation was partitioned in 1954. He attracted much attention because of his vehement anticommunism, as well as his bravado, and was highly favoured by U.S. advisers in Vietnam. As a result he was named commander of South Vietnam’s air force after the 1963 overthrow of the Ngo Dinh Diem government. With U.S. aid, Ky soon built up a fighting force of 10,000 men.
