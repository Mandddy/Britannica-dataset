F.W. Murnau, pseudonym of Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe  (born December 28, 1889, Bielefeld, Germany—died March 11, 1931, Hollywood, California, U.S.) German motion-picture director who revolutionized the art of cinematic expression by using the camera subjectively to interpret the emotional state of a character.
Murnau studied philosophy, art history, and literature at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin. In 1908 he joined the company of renowned stage director Max Reinhardt, acting in several plays and serving as Reinhardt’s assistant for the groundbreaking production of the wordless, ritualistic The Miracle (1911). After serving in the German army and air force during World War I, Murnau worked in Switzerland, where he directed short propaganda films for the German embassy. He directed his first feature film, Der Knabe in Blau (The Boy in Blue) in 1919. For the next few years Murnau made films that were Expressionistic or supernatural in nature, such as Der Januskopf (1920; Janus-Faced), a highly praised variation of the Jekyll-and-Hyde story that starred Bela Lugosi and Conrad Veidt. Unfortunately, this and most of Murnau’s early films are lost or exist only in fragmentary form.
