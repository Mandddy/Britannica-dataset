Drawing and quartering, part of the grisly penalty anciently ordained in England (1283) for the crime of treason. The full punishment for a traitor could include several steps. First he was drawn, that is, tied to a horse and dragged to the gallows. A so-called hurdle, or sledge, is sometimes mentioned in this context. Although such a device may have been a means of mercy, The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I (2nd ed., 1898; reissued 1996) states that it was more likely a way to deliver a live body to the hangman. The remainder of the punishment might include hanging (usually not to the death), usually live disemboweling, burning of the entrails, beheading, and quartering. This last step was sometimes accomplished by tying each of the four limbs to a different horse and spurring them in different directions.
The above-mentioned source cites an incident in 1238 in which a man attempting to assassinate the king was drawn, hanged, beheaded, and quartered. The first notorious sentence of drawing and quartering, however, was inflicted in 1283 on the Welsh prince David ap Gruffudd, whose punishment, one early source claims, was for myriad crimes. He was drawn for treason, hanged for homicide, disemboweled for sacrilege, and beheaded and quartered for plotting the king’s death. Another infamous case is that of the Scottish patriot Sir William Wallace, who died in 1305. According to the same early source, Wallace was drawn for treason, hanged for robbery and homicide, disemboweled for sacrilege, beheaded as an outlaw, and quartered for “divers depredations.” In 1803 Edward Marcus Despard and his six accomplices were drawn, hanged, and quartered for conspiring to assassinate George III. The sentence was last passed (though not carried out) upon two Irish Fenians in 1867, and it was officially abolished in 1870.
