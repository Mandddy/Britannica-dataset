George Grey Barnard,  (born May 24, 1863, Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 24, 1938, New York City) sculptor and art collector whose private medieval and Gothic art collection was integral to the formation of the  Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He is well known for his sculptures Love and Labor: The Unbroken Law and The Burden of Life: The Broken Law that flank the steps of the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg.
Barnard grew up in the rural Midwest, the son of a Presbyterian minister. It is thought that he learned taxidermy in his youth and made early sculptures from clay. In his late teens he moved to Chicago and studied sculpture briefly there before moving to Paris in 1883 to study further at the École des Beaux-Arts. Three years later he found a patron in Singer Company heir Alfred Corning Clark, who began commissioning works such as Brotherly Love (1886–87).
