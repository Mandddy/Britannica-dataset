The Hustler, American film drama, released in 1961, that won both popular and critical acclaim and earned each of its four major actors (Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott, and Piper Laurie) Academy Award nominations. The film sparked a resurgence of popularity in the game of pool.
Newman played “Fast” Eddie Felson, a brash pool hustler who makes a name for himself as he travels the country with an equally unscrupulous manager (played by Myron McCormick). Along the way, he encounters and uses the vulnerable Sarah (played by Laurie), with tragic results. Gleason portrayed the rotund, dapper pool champ “Minnesota Fats,” who is challenged by Fast Eddie. Scott appeared as the sinister gambling promoter Bert Gordon.
