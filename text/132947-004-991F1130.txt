Freestyle wrestling, one of three styles of wrestling used in international amateur competition (the others are Greco-Roman wrestling and sambo) under supervision of the Fédération Internationale de Lutte Amateur (International Amateur Wrestling Federation). It was derived from the English Lancashire, or catch-as-catch-can, style, in which nearly all holds were permitted. Freestyle wrestling is also an Olympic event. Women’s competition was added to the Olympic program in 2004.
Under international rules any fair hold, trip, or throw is permitted. Any hold that endangers life or limb is illegal—strangleholds, for example, are forbidden, as well as kicking, punching, butting with the head, and holding the costume. Wrestlers are cautioned for irregularities, and three cautions mean disqualification. For a serious offense, a wrestler may be disqualified immediately.
