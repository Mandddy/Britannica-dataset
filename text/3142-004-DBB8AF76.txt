Tower of Hanoi, also called Towers of Hanoi or Towers of Brahma,  puzzle involving three vertical pegs and a set of different sized disks with holes through their centres. The Tower of Hanoi is widely believed to have been invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas, though his role in its invention has been disputed. Ever popular, made of wood or plastic, the Tower of Hanoi can be found in toy shops around the world.
The typical toy set consists of three pegs fastened to a stand and of eight disks, each having a hole in the centre. The disks, all of different radii, are initially placed on one of the pegs, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest on top. The task is to transfer the stack to one of the other pegs subject to two rules: only individual disks may be moved, and no disk may be placed on a smaller disk.
