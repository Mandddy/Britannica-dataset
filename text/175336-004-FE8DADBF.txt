Witness for the Prosecution, American courtroom-drama film, released in 1957, that was based on a short story and play by English writer Agatha Christie.
The film, set in London, centres on Leonard Vole (played by Tyrone Power), who is accused of having murdered a wealthy widow. Though his attorney (Charles Laughton) believes he is innocent, his legal prospects are clouded by the fact that his only alibi is his wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich). Furthermore, during the trial, Christine shocks the court when she testifies on behalf of the prosecution, claiming that Leonard privately confessed to the crime. Her testimony is eventually discredited when it is revealed that she is having an affair, and Leonard is consequently acquitted. In a surprise twist, however, she confides to his attorney that she purposely concocted the affair to elicit sympathy for and thus protect Leonard, who was guilty all along.
