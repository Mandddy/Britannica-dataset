Khaled Hosseini,  (born March 4, 1965, Kabul, Afghanistan) Afghan-born American novelist who was known for his vivid depictions of Afghanistan, most notably in The Kite Runner (2003).
Hosseini grew up in Kabul; his father was a diplomat and his mother a secondary-school teacher. In 1976 he and his parents moved to Paris, where his father worked at the Afghan embassy. With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, they found returning to their home impossible, and they moved to California, having been granted political asylum by the United States. Hosseini attended Santa Clara University, where he studied biology, and in 1989 he began attending medical school at the University of California, San Diego. He entered private practice as an internist in 1996, three years after receiving his medical degree.
