Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus), a slender baleen whale having a profusion of external parasites that give it the appearance of a barnacle-encrusted rock.
The gray whale attains a maximum length of about 15 metres (49 feet). It is gray or black, mottled with white, and has short yellow baleen with coarse bristles. There are two (rarely more) lengthwise grooves on its throat. Instead of a dorsal fin, the back has a row of low humps along its length.
