Albert Mansbridge,  (born Jan. 10, 1876, Gloucester, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died  Aug. 22, 1952, Torquay, Devon) largely self-educated educator, the founder and chief organizer of the adult-education movement in Great Britain.
The son of a carpenter, Mansbridge had to leave school at the age of 14 owing to his family’s limited financial resources. He became a clerical worker but simultaneously satisfied his acute desire for additional education by attending university extension classes at King’s College in London. Eventually, he taught evening classes in industrial history, economics, and typing while supporting himself as a clerk during the day.
