Akashi Strait Bridge, also called Akashi Kaikyo Bridge or Pearl Bridge,  suspension bridge across the Akashi Strait (Akashi-kaikyo) in west-central Japan. It was the world’s longest suspension bridge when it opened on April 5, 1998. The six-lane road bridge connects the city of Kōbe, on the main island of Honshu, to Iwaya, on Awaji Island, which in turn is linked (via the Ōnaruto Bridge over the Naruto Strait) to the island of Shikoku to the southwest. These two bridges—together with the Seto Great Bridge between Kojima (Honshu) and Sakaide (Shikoku)—are the main components of the Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Project across Japan’s Inland Sea.
The Akashi Strait Bridge is 12,831 feet long (3,911 metres) and has three spans. The central span is 6,532 feet (1,991 metres) long, and each of the two side spans measures 3,150 feet (960 metres). The two main supporting towers stand 975 feet (297 metres) above the strait’s surface, making it one of the tallest bridges in the world. The central span was originally designed to be 6,529 feet (1,990 metres) long, but the Kōbe earthquake of 1995 forced the two towers, which were still under construction, more than 3 feet (1 metre) farther apart.
