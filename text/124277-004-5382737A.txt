Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi,  (born Jan. 12, 1746, Zürich—died Feb. 17, 1827, Brugg, Switz.) Swiss educational reformer, who advocated education of the poor and emphasized teaching methods designed to strengthen the student’s own abilities. Pestalozzi’s method became widely accepted, and most of his principles have been absorbed into modern elementary education.
Pestalozzi’s pedagogical doctrines stressed that instructions should proceed from the familiar to the new, incorporate the performance of concrete arts and the experience of actual emotional responses, and be paced to follow the gradual unfolding of the child’s development. His ideas flow from the same stream of thought that includes Johann Friedrich Herbart, Maria Montessori, John Dewey, and more recently Jean Piaget and advocates of the language experience approach such as R.V. Allen.
