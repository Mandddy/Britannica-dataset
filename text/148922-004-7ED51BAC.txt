Sutherland, historic county, northern Scotland. It faces the North Sea on the east and the Atlantic Ocean on the north and northwest, where Cape Wrath, with its magnificent cliffs, is mainland Great Britain’s northwestern extremity. It lies entirely within the Highland council area.
Chambered cairns, standing stones and stone rows, hill forts, settlements, and brochs (round towers) are among the prehistoric remains of Sutherland. Successively settled by Picts, Scots, and Norsemen, Sutherland and Caithness (a neighbouring county) were held in the first half of the 11th century by Thorfinn (died c. 1065), the Norse jarl of Orkney, whose mother was a daughter of the Scottish king Malcolm II. The Norse named the area Suðrland (“Southern Land”) in relation to their settlements in Orkney and Shetland. After conquering the region, William I of Scotland (reigned 1165–1214) seems to have granted land in Sutherland to a Hugh Freskin, whose son William was probably designated earl in 1235.
