Extrusive rock, any rock derived from magma (molten silicate material) that was poured out or ejected at Earth’s surface. By contrast, intrusive rocks are formed from magma that was forced into older rocks at depth within Earth’s crust; the molten material then slowly solidifies below Earth’s surface, where it may later be exposed through erosion. Extrusive rocks are usually distinguished from intrusive rocks on the basis of their texture and mineral composition.
Both lava flows and pyroclastic debris (fragmented volcanic material) are extrusive; they are commonly glassy (obsidian) or finely crystalline (basalts and felsites). Many extrusive rocks also contain intrusive components; this mixture of fine- and coarse-grained textures is described as porphyritic.
