Woodcock,  any of five species of squat-bodied, long-billed birds of damp, dense woodlands, allied to the snipes in the waterbird family Scolopacidae (order Charadriiformes). The woodcock is a startling game bird: crouched among dead leaves, well camouflaged by its buffy-brown, mottled plumage, a woodcock remains motionless until almost stepped upon and then takes off in an explosive movement. With its eyes set farther back on the head than those of any other bird, a woodcock has a 360Â° field of vision. The ear opening is located below, rather than behind, the eye socket.
A solitary bird that is most active at dusk, the woodcock lives chiefly on earthworms; it attracts the worms to the suface by drumming with its feet and then extracts them from the ground with its long, sensitive bill, which opens at the tip like a forceps. This feeding habit makes it necessary for woodcocks to migrate; they leave an area as soon as the ground starts to freeze. A single bird may eat twice its weight, or about 450 g (1 pound), in worms per day.
