Anta, plural antas, or antae,  in architecture, slightly projecting column at the end of a wall, produced by either a thickening of the wall or attachment of a separate strip. The former type, commonly flanking porches of Greek and Roman temples, is a masonry vestige of the wooden structural posts used to reinforce the brick walls of such early antique temples as the Heraeum of Olympia (c. 600 bc).
The bases and capitals of these antas were not required to conform to the style, or order, of the temple column. The attached strip anta is commonly found in Renaissance and post-Renaissance styles of architecture influenced by classical antiquity. As a decorative feature, the anta is considered to be the forerunner of the pilaster.
