Bull terrier, breed of dog developed in 19th-century England from the bulldog, the white English terrier (a breed now extinct), and the Dalmatian; other breeds including the Spanish pointer, foxhound, and greyhound may also have been incorporated.
The bull terrier was developed for the dog-fighting pits as a courageous fighter but not an aggressive fight provoker. A muscular dog, it has a short coat; tapering tail; erect ears; small, triangular, deep-set eyes; and a distinctive egg-shaped, or convex, head. It stands 21 to 22 inches (53 to 56 cm) and weighs about 50 to 60 pounds (23 to 27 kg). The miniature bull terrier, recognized as a separate breed, stands 10 to 14 inches (25 to 35 cm) and weighs 24 to 33 pounds (11 to 15 kg). In both sizes the coat may be coloured—i.e., any colour but white, including brindle; or white—i.e., all white or white with darker head markings. The bull terrier is active, loyal, and playful—even clownish—and is considered for its weight one of the strongest of all dogs.
