Ferran Adrià, in full Fernando Adrià Acosta  (born May 14, 1962, L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain) Catalan chef who, as the creative force behind the restaurant El Bulli (closed in 2011), pioneered the influential culinary trend known as molecular gastronomy, which uses precise scientific techniques to create inventive and evocative high-end cuisine. In the early 21st century many considered him the best chef in the world.
Adrià was raised in Barcelona. After dropping out of school at age 18, he took a job as a dishwasher at a hotel restaurant in order to finance a trip to Ibiza. At that restaurant he began to learn about classic gastronomic techniques, and his training led to kitchen jobs at other restaurants in the area. In 1982 Adrià joined the navy to fulfill his compulsory military service, and he eventually became chef to an admiral stationed in Cartagena. At the end of his service, he accepted a one-month internship at El Bulli, a respected French restaurant in Roses, on the Costa Brava. In early 1984 he was hired there as a line cook, and eight months later, after the head chef departed, he and another cook were put in joint charge of the kitchen. By 1987 Adrià had become the restaurant’s sole chef de cuisine.
