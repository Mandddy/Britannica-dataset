Bernie Madoff, in full Bernard Lawrence Madoff  (born April 29, 1938, Queens, N.Y., U.S.)  American hedge-fund investment manager and former chairman of the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) stock market. He was best known for operating history’s largest Ponzi scheme, a financial swindle in which early investors are repaid with money acquired from later investors rather than from actual investment income.
Madoff grew up in the predominantly Jewish neighbourhood of Laurelton in Queens, N.Y. After spending his freshman year at the University of Alabama, he earned a degree (1960) in political science from Hofstra University, Hempstead, N.Y. He studied law briefly at Brooklyn Law School before founding (1960) Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities with his wife, Ruth, who worked on Wall Street after earning a degree in psychology from Queens College, City University of New York. Madoff’s specialty was so-called penny stocks—very low-priced shares that traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, the predecessor to the NASDAQ exchange. Madoff served as a NASDAQ director for three one-year terms.
