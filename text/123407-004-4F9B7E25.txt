Pinacoteca di Brera,  English Brera Picture Gallery,  art museum in Milan, founded in 1809 by Napoleon I, and one of Italy’s largest art galleries. Its original collection was that of Milan’s Academy of Fine Arts, though its most important works were acquired later. The museum’s holdings consist mainly of Italian paintings from the Quattrocento (15th century) to the Rococo period (18th century). It has especially rich collections of Venetian and Lombard paintings from the Renaissance and Baroque periods.
The gallery is housed in the Palazzo di Brera, an 18th-century Neoclassical structure that was originally built, from plans by Francesco Maria Ricchino, as a Jesuit college. The same building also houses the Academy of Fine Arts, founded in 1776, and the Braidense National Library, founded in 1770.
