Thomas E. Dewey, in full Thomas Edmund Dewey   (born March 24, 1902, Owosso, Mich., U.S.—died March 16, 1971, Bal Harbour, Fla.) vigorous American prosecuting attorney whose successful racket-busting career won him three terms as governor of New York (1943–55). A longtime Republican leader, he was his party’s presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948 but lost in both elections.
Dewey graduated from the University of Michigan in 1923 and received a law degree from Columbia University in 1925. Dewey was admitted to the New York bar in 1926 and launched his government career five years later as chief assistant to the U.S. attorney for the southern district of the state. Between 1935 and 1937 he garnered national attention as special prosecutor in an investigation of organized crime in New York; he obtained 72 convictions out of 73 prosecutions of long-established racketeers. Elected district attorney in 1937, Dewey continued to impress the electorate with his legal acumen and with his personal drive and integrity.
