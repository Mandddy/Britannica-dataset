John Mauchly, in full John William Mauchly, also called John W. Mauchly  (born August 30, 1907, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.â€”died January 8, 1980, Ambler, Pennsylvania) American physicist and engineer, coinventor in 1946, with John P. Eckert, of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the first general-purpose electronic computer.
After completing his education, Mauchly entered the teaching profession, eventually becoming an associate professor of electrical engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. During World War II Mauchly and Eckert, a graduate engineer, were asked to devise ways to accelerate the recomputation of artillery firing tables for the U.S. Army. They accordingly proposed the construction of a general-purpose digital computer that would handle data in coded form, and by 1946 they completed the ENIAC, a huge machine (containing more than 18,000 vacuum tubes) that incorporated features developed by J.V. Atanasoff. The ENIAC was first used by the U.S. Army at its Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland in 1947 for ballistics tests.
