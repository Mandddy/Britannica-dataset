Ocelot (Felis, or Leopardus, pardalis), spotted cat of the New World, found in lowland areas from Texas southward to northern Argentina. The short, smooth fur is patterned with elongated, black-edged spots that are arranged in chainlike bands. The cat’s upper parts vary in colour from light or tawny yellow to gray. There are small black spots on the head, two black stripes on each cheek, and four or five black stripes along the neck. The ocelot’s underparts are whitish, spotted with black, and the tail is marked on the upper surface with dark bars or blotches.
Though larger than domestic cats, ocelots are small compared to jaguars. Adults measure about 70–90 cm (28–35 inches) long, not including the tail, and stand about 45 cm (18 inches) at the shoulder. They weigh 11–16 kg (24–35 pounds), with females being generally smaller than males.
