Kudzu vine (Pueraria montana), twining perennial vine of the pea family (Fabaceae). Kudzu is native to China and Japan, where it has long been grown for its edible starchy roots and for a fibre made from its stems. The kudzu vine is a useful fodder crop for livestock as well as an attractive ornamental. However, it is an aggressive invasive species in some areas outside its native range.
Kudzu is a fast-growing woody, somewhat hairy vine that may grow to a length of 18 metres (60 feet) in one season and features a substantial taproot. It has large compound leaves with three broad leaflets with hairy margins. The plant bears long racemes of late-blooming reddish purple flowers and flat hairy seed pods. The plant spreads vegetatively with stolons and rhizomes that root to form new clonal plants.
