Osman II, also called Genç Osman (“Young Osman”)   (born November 15, 1603, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died May 20, 1622, Constantinople) Ottoman sultan who came to the throne as an active and intelligent boy of 14 and who during his short rule (1618–22) understood the need for reform within the empire.
Ambitious and courageous, Osman undertook a military campaign against Poland, which had interfered in the Ottoman vassal principalities of Moldavia and Walachia. Realizing that his defeat at Chocim (Khotin, Ukraine) in 1621 largely stemmed from the lack of discipline and the degeneracy of the Janissary corps, he proceeded to discipline them by cutting their pay and closing their coffee shops. Then he announced a plan to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, but his real purpose was to recruit a new army in Egypt and Syria to break the power of the Janissaries. Hearing of this scheme and already resentful because of Osman’s previous policies, the Janissaries revolted, deposed Osman on May 19, 1622, and strangled him the next day.
