Busby Berkeley, original name William Berkeley Enos  (born November 29, 1895, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died March 14, 1976, Palm Springs, California) American motion-picture director and choreographer noted for the elaborate dancing-girl extravaganzas he created on film. Using innovative camera techniques, he revolutionized the genre of the musical in the Great Depression era. That phase of his career, which he spent at the Warner Brothers studio, was followed by more sedate films in the 1940s and ’50s, and he never regained his early feverish momentum.
William Berkeley Enos (some sources give his birth name as Busby Berkeley William Enos) came from a theatrical family: his father, Frank Enos, was an actor and a director, and his mother, Gertrude Berkeley, was an actress. After his father died in 1904, he was placed in boarding schools, his longest stint being from 1909 to 1914 at the Mohegan Lake Military Academy in Peekskill, New York. After he graduated, he worked for a shoe company in Athol, New York, and in 1917 he enlisted for service in World War I. As one of his military duties, he oversaw close-order drills for both American and French forces, experience that later would serve him well as inspiration for many of his cinematic flights of fancy. He took advantage of his mother’s theatrical connections to get a position as an entertainment officer, directing and producing shows for American troops in postwar Germany.
