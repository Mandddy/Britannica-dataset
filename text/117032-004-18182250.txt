Perching duck, any of the species of the tribe Cairinini, family Anatidae (order Anseriformes), waterfowl that typically inhabit wet woodlands, nest in holes in trees, and perch on branches by means of their long-clawed toes. The tribe is widely represented, especially in the tropics. Perching ducks are closely akin to dabbling ducks, which they resemble in feeding habits and, in some species, courtship behaviour; in other respects they are like shelducks. Some possess a bony knob at the wing bend, and most forms show white wing patches and black wing linings. Drakes are larger than hens and, on the whole, more brightly patternedâ€”sometimes in metallic colours.
Best known among the perching ducks are: the North American wood duck (Aix sponsa), or Carolina duck, and its Asian relative, the mandarin duck (A. galericulata), both exceptionally colourful; and the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), of Mexico to Peru and Uruguay. The smallest of waterfowl are the little-known perching ducks of tropical forests, the so-called pygmy geese (Nettapus species).
