Alfred Escher,  (born Feb. 20, 1819, Zürich—died  Dec. 6, 1882, Zürich) dominant figure in 19th-century Zürich politics and legislator of national prominence who, as a railway magnate, became a leading opponent of railway nationalization.
Quickly rising in cantonal political affairs, Escher had by 1848 become president of the Zürich government. Elected the same year to the Nationalrat (national assembly), he was four times its president, notably during the Neuchâtel crisis with Prussia (1856–57). Often a voice for moderation against the advocacy of radical measures by Jakob Stämpfli, he tempered passions in the Neuchâtel affair and urged peaceful accommodation in the controversy arising from the cession of Savoy to France (1860).
