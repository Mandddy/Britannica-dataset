Friedrich Hecker,  (born September 28, 1811, Eichtersheim, Baden—died March 24, 1881, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.) German revolutionary republican politician who led radical forces that demanded that the 1848 revolution establish a republican form of government in Germany.
A lawyer, Hecker in 1842 was elected to Baden’s second chamber, where he quickly established himself as the leader of the liberal opposition. He became a Democrat, and in the revolutionary Vorparlament (Preparliament) he attempted to turn that body into a permanent revolutionary peoples’ committee (1848), demanding the elimination of the monarchies. When the assembly majority decided to try to win Germany’s princes over to their new constitution, Hecker and the radicals walked out.
