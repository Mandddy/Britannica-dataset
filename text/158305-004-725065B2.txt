Richard Doddridge Blackmore,  (born June 7, 1825, Longworth, Berkshire, England—died January 20, 1900, Teddington, Middlesex) English Victorian novelist whose novel Lorna Doone (1869) won a secure place among English historical romances.
Educated at Blundell’s School, Tiverton, and at Exeter College, Oxford, Blackmore was called to the bar but withdrew because of ill health. He married in 1852 and was a schoolteacher from 1855 to 1857. Then, upon receiving a legacy, he bought a property at Teddington and settled down to fruit growing. After publishing some poems, Blackmore produced Clara Vaughan, a first and fairly successful novel, in 1864 and Cradock Nowell in 1866. Lorna Doone (1869) was his third. Its popularity grew slowly, until the qualities of this imaginative and exciting tale of 17th-century Exmoor eventually brought it fame. Blackmore was a pioneer in the revival of romance fiction in the late 19th century, and his use of regional settings was also influential. Blackmore himself, a reserved but kindly man who was prouder of his orchard than of his 14 novels, thought The Maid of Sker (1872) and Springhaven (1887) to be his best books.
