Charles Laughton,  (born July 1, 1899, Scarborough, Yorkshire, Englandâ€”died December 15, 1962, Hollywood, California, U.S.) gifted British actor and director who defied the Hollywood typecasting system to emerge as one of most versatile performers of his generation.
The son of a Yorkshire hotel keeper, Laughton was expected to go into the family business after graduating from Stonyhurst School at age 16. He was instead drawn to performing, and in 1925 he enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Making his first professional London stage appearance in a 1926 production of The Government Inspector, he was able to avoid the usual typecasting brought on by a homely face and bulky frame, playing a wide variety of characters both villainous and virtuous. He made his film debut in the two-reel British comedy Blue Bottles in 1928, the same year that he met his future wife, actress Elsa Lanchester. He went to New York City in 1931, where he repeated his London stage success in Payment Deferred (1932), and was signed by Paramount Pictures the following year. Cast as a raving lunatic in his first American picture, Devil and the Deep (1932), he immediately counteracted this image with his portrayal of a good-natured industrialist in The Old Dark House (1932). Shortly afterward he switched gears again to play the depraved Nero in The Sign of the Cross (1932). He returned to England in 1933 to play the title role in The Private Life of Henry VIII, a rich, robust performance that won him an Academy Award.
