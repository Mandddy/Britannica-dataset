Ida (Darwinius masillae), nickname for the remarkably complete but nearly two-dimensional skeleton of an adapiform primate dating to the middle Eocene Epoch (approximately 47 million years ago). It is the type specimen and the only known example of Darwinius masillae, a species assigned to the adapiform subfamily Cercamoniinae. The specimen, a juvenile female, was named for the daughter of Norwegian paleontologist Jørn Hurum. He was one of the scientists involved in the original description of the specimen. It was so named because his daughter had reached a similar developmental stage during the study.
The specimen was originally hailed by members of the scientific team who described it as a potential “missing link” between primitive primates and anthropoids (that is, the group that includes monkeys, apes and humans). Most scientists, however, regard Darwinius as a typical member of the expansive adapiform evolutionary radiation. Adapiforms are one of the earliest and most primitive known groups of fossil primates. Most scientists consider adapiforms as basal members of the suborder that includes lemurs and lorises, which are distantly related to humans and other anthropoids.
