Julie Christie,  (born April 14, 1941, Chukua, Assam, India) British film actress renowned for a wide range of roles in English and American films of the 1960s and ’70s, as well as for her strikingly attractive looks and offbeat, free-spirited personality.
Christie was born on her father’s Indian tea plantation but was educated in England and France. She studied acting at London’s Central School for Drama and made her stage debut in 1957. Her first major film role was in director John Schlesinger’s Billy Liar (1963). In 1965 she found stardom and won an Academy Award for playing a self-destructive fashion model in Schlesinger’s Darling. That same year, she also appeared as the romantic heroine Lara in David Lean’s enormously successful screen adaptation of Boris Pasternak’s Doctor Zhivago. She played dual roles in director François Truffaut’s production of Ray Bradbury’s science-fiction novel Fahrenheit 451 (1966) and portrayed the Thomas Hardy heroine Bathsheba in Far from the Madding Crowd (1967), her final theatrical film with Schlesinger.
