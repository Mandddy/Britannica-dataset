Cool Hand Luke, American film drama, released in 1967, featuring Paul Newman in one of his most highly regarded performances, as a convict who refuses to kowtow to his sadistic jailers. Newmanâ€™s antihero role was especially popular amid the anti-establishment currents of the 1960s.
Sentenced to a chain gang in the South for committing a petty crime, banjo-playing nonconformist Luke Jackson (played by Newman) repeatedly defies the authority of the prison warden (Strother Martin) and befuddles the guards with a series of daring escapes. In the process, he provides inspiration and vicarious thrills for his fellow inmates. The mounting tension between Luke and his jailers, however, leads to tragedy.
