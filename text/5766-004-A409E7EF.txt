Aquarius, (
        Latin: “Water Bearer”) in astronomy, zodiacal constellation lying in the southern sky between Capricornus and Pisces, at about 22 hours right ascension and 10° south declination. It lacks striking features, the brightest star, Sadalmelik (Arabic for “the lucky stars of the king”), being of magnitude 3.0.
In astrology, Aquarius is the 11th sign of the zodiac, considered as governing the period from about January 20 to about February 18. Its representation as a man pouring a stream of water out of a jug came about, it has been suggested, because in ancient times the rising of Aquarius coincided in the Middle East with a period of floods and rain.
