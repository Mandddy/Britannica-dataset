Maurice Donnay, in full Maurice-Charles Donnay  (born October 12, 1859, Paris, France—died March 31, 1945, Paris) French playwright whose dramas deal with love and adultery, social problems, and the manners of his time.
Donnay was born into a wealthy family and originally trained to be a civil engineer. His dramatic career began with monologues written for the literary cabaret Le Chat-Noir. He made his name in the theatre with Amants (1895; “Lovers”), one of his best plays and the first work of a series called “Théâtre d’Amour,” which also includes La Douloureuse (1897) and L’Affranchie (1898), both of which are dramas about women whose loves are spoiled by lies. A second cycle of plays, including Le Retour de Jérusalem (1903) and Les Éclaireuses (1913), deals with current social problems; and another group of plays, including La Chasse à l’homme (1919) and La Reprise (1924), are comedies of manners, depicting France after World War I.
