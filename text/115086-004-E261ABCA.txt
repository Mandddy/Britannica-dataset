Caravan,  a group of merchants, pilgrims, or travelers journeying together, usually for mutual protection in deserts or other hostile regions. In the deserts of Asia and northern Africa, the animal most commonly used in caravans was the camel, because of its catholic appetite, its ability to go without water for several days, and its loading capacity. In some areas the camel was harnessed to a cart (as was the case in the tea trade between Kalgan in China and Kyakhta in Mongolia), but usually the load was divided into two parts and secured on either side of the camel’s back. In hot weather, on a long journey, a camel characteristically carried about 350 pounds (160 kg); but, on shorter journeys, in cooler weather, or in order to evade customs duties, the animal’s load might be increased to 1,000 pounds. Passengers were carried in panniers slung one on each side of the camel.
The size of the caravan was dependent upon the amount of traffic, the insecurity of the route, and the availability of camels. The largest recorded caravans were those for special purposes, such as the Muslim pilgrim caravans from Cairo and Damascus to Mecca, which might include over 10,000 camels, or the trans-Saharan salt caravans from Taoudenni to Timbuktu or Bilma or Aïr. Even in its decline in 1908 this latter caravan numbered 20,000 camels.
