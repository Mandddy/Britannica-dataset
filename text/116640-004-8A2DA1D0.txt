The history of the university began with the founding of Corvallis College, a coeducational preparatory academy, in 1858. Two years later it was sold to the Methodist church, and it began teaching college-level courses in 1865. In 1868 the academy, under partial control of the state, was chartered as a college and received land-grant status; agriculture was added to the curriculum. Several name changes took place in the 1870s and ’80s. In 1885 the state took complete control of the college, and the name was changed to State Agricultural College of Oregon and later Oregon Agricultural College. It became Oregon State College in 1937 and was awarded university standing in 1961. Noteworthy alumni include two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling and inventor Douglas Engelbart.
