Cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), also called salmonberry, yellowberry, bakeapple, bakeberry, malka, or baked apple berry,  creeping herbaceous plant in the rose family (Rosaceae), native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the north temperate zone, and its edible raspberry-like fruit. Eskimos and Sami collect the sweet juicy fruits in autumn to freeze for winter food. In markets of northern Scandinavia, cloudberries are sold for use in preserves, tarts, and other confections. They are also made into a liqueur.
Cloudberries are low-growing perennials that spread readily by a creeping rootlike stem, or rhizome. The toothed leaves are circular with rounded lobes. The plants are dioecious, meaning individuals are either male or female. Female plants produce yellow or amber-coloured fruit from a 2.5-cm (1-inch) white flower. The fruits—each technically an aggregate of druplets—are borne terminally on stalks that grow to a height of 7.6–25 cm (3–10 inches).
