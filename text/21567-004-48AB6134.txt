Adah Isaacs Menken, original name Ada McCord  (born June 15, 1835, Memphis, Tenn., U.S.—died Aug. 10, 1868, Paris, France) American actress and poet widely celebrated for her daring act of appearing (seemingly) naked, strapped to a running horse.
The facts concerning Menken’s early life are obscured by later and confused publicity stories. On various occasions she claimed various original names, birthplaces, and histories. It seems likely that her family at some time in her childhood moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. She displayed an early talent for singing and dancing, and she later claimed that in her youth she rode horses in a circus, modeled for a sculptor, and danced in the New Orleans French Opera House. She married Alexander Isaac Menken in Livingston, Texas, in 1856 and thereafter retained his name on the stage through several short-lived marriages. She appeared on the stage at Shreveport, Louisiana, in The Lady of Lyons as early as 1857 and made her debut in New Orleans the same year in Fazio. She began to publish verse about that time; several poems appeared in the Cincinnati Israelite during 1857–59 and in the New York Sunday Mercury in 1860–61.
