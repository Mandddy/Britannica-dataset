Thabo Mbeki,  (born June 18, 1942, Idutywa, Transkei [now South Africa]) politician who served as the president of South Africa (1999–2008).
Mbeki was early exposed to politics by his father, a longtime leader in the Eastern Cape African National Congress (ANC), an organization dedicated to the elimination of apartheid in South Africa, who was later imprisoned (1964–87) with Nelson Mandela. The younger Mbeki attended schools in Transkei, including the well-known Lovedale secondary school in Alice, and in 1956 joined the ANC Youth League. Three years later he led a student strike at Lovedale that resulted in his expulsion. Mbeki continued his studies at home and remained active in the ANC after it was banned in South Africa in 1960. In 1962 he left South Africa illegally and enrolled at the University of Sussex in Brighton, England, from which he graduated with an M.A. in economics in 1966.
