Walter Cronkite, in full Walter Leland Cronkite, Jr.  (born November 4, 1916, St. Joseph, Missouri, U.S.—died July 17, 2009, New York, New York) American journalist and pioneer of television news programming who became known as “the most trusted man in America.” He was the longtime anchor of the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite (1962–81), for which he reported on many of the most historic events of the latter half of the 20th century.
As a boy, Cronkite was an avid reader of books, magazines, and newspapers. In 1927 he moved with his family to Houston, where he worked on school newspapers in both middle school and high school. After graduating he studied political science at the University of Texas at Austin (1933–35) and, to help pay his tuition, worked as a correspondent for a Houston newspaper. In 1935 he left college to take a full-time position with the paper. In 1939 Cronkite became a news editor for United Press (UP; see United Press International). When the United States entered World War II in 1941, UP elevated Cronkite to overseas war correspondent, assigning him to cover fighting in the North Atlantic. He was soon reassigned to London, where he reported on German bombing raids on the city. Cronkite also covered the invasion of North Africa. He flew in bombing raids over Germany and in 1944 reported on the Allied landing on the beaches of Normandy, France, on D-Day. After the war’s conclusion, he remained in Europe, covering the Nürnberg trials and helping set up numerous UP bureaus. Before returning to the United States, he served as UP bureau chief in Moscow (1946–48).
