Lord Howe Island, island dependency of New South Wales, Australia. It is situated in the southwestern Pacific Ocean some 435 miles (700 km) northeast of Sydney.
The island is volcanic in origin and crescent-shaped, with two peaks (Mounts Gower and Lidgbird), each rising above 2,500 feet (760 metres) at its southern end. The island is well wooded but has little arable land. National parks cover some three-fourths of the land area, harbouring rare vegetation and birdlife; this parkland and several adjacent islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. The island was discovered in 1788 and named for Admiral Lord Howe by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball of the British navy. The island was first settled in 1834 and became a supply station for whalers. There is an airstrip, with regularly scheduled flights to and from the mainland. The islandâ€™s main income is derived from tourism. Area 7 square miles (17 square km). Pop. (2006) 347; (2011) 360.
