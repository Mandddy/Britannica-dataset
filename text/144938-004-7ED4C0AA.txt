Wyclef Jean, byname of Nel Ust Wyclef Jean, original name Nel Ust Wycliffe Jean  (born October 17, 1969, Croix des Bouquets, Haiti) Haitian rapper, producer, and philanthropist whose dynamic, politically inflected rhymes and keen ear for hooks established him as a significant force in popular music.
Born in a suburb of Port-au-Prince, Jean was raised by relatives after his parents immigrated to the United States. At age nine he and his younger brother joined their parents in Brooklyn, New York. The family moved to Newark, New Jersey, when he was a teenager. Jean’s father, a Nazarene minister, prohibited rap music and encouraged Jean to channel his musical talents into the church choir. Nonetheless, Jean joined Tranzlator Crew (later known as the Fugees), a rap group founded by Prakazrel (“Pras”) Michel and Michel’s friend Lauryn Hill, in the late 1980s.
