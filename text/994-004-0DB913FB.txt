Gortyn, also spelled Gortyna ,  ancient Greek city toward the western end of the southern plain (Mesara) of Crete (near modern Áyioi Dhéka). Although unimportant in Minoan times, Gortyn displaced Phaestus as the dominant city in the Mesara. It shared or disputed control of the island with Knossos until the Roman annexation in 67 bce. Its importance lay in its control of the sea route between east and west through its ports of Matalon and Leben.
The region has been the centre of Italian archaeological research on Crete (Modern Greek: Kríti) since 1884, when the great civic inscription, or “code,” of Gortyn was discovered. The code is the most extensive monument of Greek law before the Hellenistic Age. Later excavations disclosed most of the plan and public buildings of the Roman city, which was the administrative capital of the Roman province of Crete and Cyrenaica.
