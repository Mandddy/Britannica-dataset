A. S. W. Rosenbach,  (born July 22, 1876, Philadelphia—died  July 1, 1952, Philadelphia) U.S. book and manuscript collector and dealer who combined solid scholarship and exceptional business acumen.
Rosenbach attended the University of Pennsylvania (B.S. 1898; Ph.D. 1901), where as a freshman he bought for $3.60 a first edition of Dr. Johnson’s prologue at the reopening of Drury Lane Theatre in 1747; he later refused $5,000 for it. From 1895 to 1901 he was a teaching fellow in the English department, and before 1903 he joined his brother Philip in launching the Rosenbach Company, A.S.W. handling books and Philip the antiques. The firm was soon able to buy entire libraries, expanding their business into what may have been the most lucrative book concern in the world. Among his clients were Henry E. Huntington, founder of the library bearing his name at San Marino, Calif., and J. Pierpont Morgan, founder of the library bearing his name in New York City. In 1947 Rosenbach bought a copy of The Bay Psalm Book for $151,000, then a record price. A shrewd bibliophile, Rosenbach came to be the most formidable bidder of his time at auctions in the U.S. and Europe. The total of his purchases was estimated to exceed $75,000,000.
