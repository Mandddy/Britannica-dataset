V-2 missile, German in full Vergeltungswaffen-2 (“Vengeance Weapon 2”), also called V-2 rocket or A-4,  German ballistic missile of World War II, the forerunner of modern space rockets and long-range missiles.
Developed in Germany from 1936 through the efforts of scientists led by Wernher von Braun, it was first successfully launched on October 3, 1942, and was fired against Paris on September 6, 1944. Two days later the first of more than 1,100 V-2s was fired against Great Britain (the last on March 27, 1945). Belgium was also heavily bombarded. After the war both the United States and the Soviet Union captured large numbers of V-2s and used them in research that led to the development of their missile and space exploration programs.
