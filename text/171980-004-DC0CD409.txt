Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt, née Sarah Morgan Bryan  (born August 11, 1836, Fayette county, Kentucky, U.S.—died December 22, 1919, Caldwell, New Jersey) American poet whose particular blend of convention and innovation won her praise and censure during her lifetime and whose writing was rediscovered by scholars beginning in the 1980s.
Sarah Morgan Bryan was born to a slave-holding family in 1836 and lived a somewhat itinerant childhood after the death of her mother. Though little is known about her literary preferences as a child, she went on to study the Romantics at the Henry Female College in New Castle, Kentucky. Soon after graduating, she began to write and publish poems influenced heavily by Lord Byron—too heavily in the opinion of her editor and mentor George Prentice. Some of these poems, which tend to be classed in her juvenilia, appeared in the Louisville Journal along with the poems of John James Piatt, whom Sarah Morgan Bryan would marry in 1861.
