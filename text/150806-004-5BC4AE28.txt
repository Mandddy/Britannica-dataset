Proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus), long-tailed arboreal primate found along rivers and in swampy mangrove forests of Borneo. Named for the male’s long and pendulous nose, the proboscis monkey is red-brown with pale underparts. The nose is smaller in the female and is upturned in the young. Males are 56–72 cm (22–28 inches) long and average 20 kg (44 pounds), but females weigh only about 10 kg (22 pounds). The tail is about the same length as the body. Proboscis monkeys live in groups of about 20 consisting of a single male and up to a dozen females; males live in bachelor groups. The young have blue faces and are born singly, apparently at any time of year; gestation is estimated at five to six months. Proboscis monkeys wade upright through water, which makes them exceptional among monkeys in being habitually bipedal.
Despite government protection, habitat destruction has caused a decline in the population of this species. Proboscis monkeys belong to the same subfamily as langurs and colobus monkeys of the family Cercopithecidae.
