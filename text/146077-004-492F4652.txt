John Byrom,  (born Feb. 29, 1692, Kersal Cell, near Manchester, Eng.â€”died  Sept. 26, 1763, London) English poet, hymnist, and inventor of a system of shorthand.
Byrom was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was elected fellow in 1714. He then went abroad, ostensibly to study medicine; in view of his Jacobite leanings his journey may have been political. On his return to London in 1718, he taught his own method of shorthand and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1724.
