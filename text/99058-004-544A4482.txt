Snapping turtle, either of several species of freshwater turtles (family Chelydridae) named for their method of biting. Snapping turtles are found continuously in North America from eastern Canada and New England to the Rockies, and they are also found in pockets from Mexico and Central America to Ecuador. Snapping turtles are noted for their large size and aggressive nature. They are tan to black in colour and have a rough upper shell, a small cross-shaped lower shell, a long tail, and a large head with hooked jaws. The female in both species lays clutches of 20 to 40 eggs; the young at hatching have shells about 2.5–4 cm (1–1.5 inches) long. Snapping turtles have long been valued as food.
The distribution of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is widespread from Canada to the west coast of northern South America. C. serpentina serpentina is the subspecies found throughout southern and eastern Canada and in the eastern half of the United States. It is distinguished by a saw-edged crest on the upper side of its tail and averages 20–30 cm (8–12 inches) in shell length and 4.5–16 kg (10–35 pounds) in weight. When young it has three longitudinal ridges on the upper shell; these become worn down with time. The common snapping turtle is often found buried in mud in shallow water. It is omnivorous, although it prefers animal prey. It is usually unaggressive in the water; however, it may lunge and snap while on land. Three other snapping turtle subspecies—C. serpentina osceola of Florida, C. serpentina rossignoni of Central America, and C. serpentina acutirostris of Ecuador—are also recognized. The latter two are generally smaller than C. serpentina serpentina.
