Coro, city, capital of Falcón state, northwestern Venezuela. It lies 200 miles (320 km) west-northwest of Caracas, at the southern end of the isthmus linking the Paraguaná Peninsula to the mainland. It is 105 feet (32 metres) above sea level. Coro and its Caribbean Sea port, La Vela, 7 miles (11 km) to the east-northeast, were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993.
Coro was founded in 1527 during an attempt by the Spanish crown to suppress slave hunting in the area. Its original name, Santa Ana de Coriana, was derived from the name of the Coros Indians, who inhabited the region. The settlement was the site of the chief factory (trading station) of the Welsers, the German banking house to which the Spanish king Charles V mortgaged western Venezuela between 1528 and 1546 (in effect, it served as a regional capital during that period). It became the base for expeditions in search of Eldorado, the legendary country of gold. Francisco de Miranda, the “precursor of independence,” led his forces (1806) to Coro in the first attempt to free the colony from Spanish domination.
