Werner von Siemens, in full Ernst Werner Von Siemens   (born Dec. 13, 1816, Lenthe, Prussia [now in Germany]—died  Dec. 6, 1892, Charlottenburg, Berlin, Ger.) German electrical engineer who played an important role in the development of the telegraph industry.
After attending grammar school at Lübeck, Siemens joined the Prussian artillery at age 17 for the training in engineering that his father could not afford. While in prison briefly at Magdeburg for acting as second in a duel between fellow officers, he carried out chemistry experiments in his cell. These led, in 1842, to his first invention: an electroplating process. His appointment about 1841 to the artillery workshops in Berlin gave him an opportunity to do research, which in turn set the direction of his life’s work.
