Mario Lemieux,  (born Oct. 5, 1965, Montreal, Que., Can.) Canadian professional ice hockey player who is considered one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.
Lemieux starred in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League as a teenager, setting a league record by scoring 282 points in 70 games during the 1983–84 season. He was chosen by the Pittsburgh Penguins with the first overall selection in the 1984 National Hockey League (NHL) draft. Lemieux had an outstanding rookie season: he scored 100 points, was named to the All-Star team, and was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL’s rookie of the year. He scored more than 100 points in each of his first six years in Pittsburgh and was named NHL Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the 1987–88 season, but the Penguins only qualified for the play-offs once during that period and were eliminated in the second round.
