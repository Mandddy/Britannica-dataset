John Wilmot, 2nd earl of Rochester,  (born April 1, 1647, Ditchley Manor House, Oxfordshire, Eng.â€”died July 26, 1680, Woodstock, Eng.) court wit and poet who helped establish English satiric poetry.
Wilmot succeeded his father to the earldom in 1658, and he received his M.A. at Oxford in 1661. Charles II, probably out of gratitude to the 1st earl, who had helped him to escape after the Battle of Worcester (1651), gave the young earl an annual pension and appointed Sir Andrew Balfour, a Scottish physician, as his tutor. They travelled on the Continent for three years until 1664.
