Battle of Chāldirān, (August 23, 1514), military engagement in which the Ottomans won a decisive victory over the Ṣafavids of Iran and went on to gain control of eastern Anatolia.
In 1514 the Ottoman sultan Selim I launched a campaign against Shah Esmāʿīl I, founder of the Ṣafavid dynasty, to put an end to Ṣafavid influence among the Turkmen tribes (the Kizilbash [“Red Heads,” so called for their red turbans]) who were in open revolt against Ottoman domination and who expressed their discontent by defying orthodoxy. The Ṣafavid state, based on mysticism, and the Turkmen in Azerbaijan and Iran offered the Anatolian Turkmen religious and political alternatives, and Ṣafavid envoys conducted extensive missionary activity throughout Anatolia.
