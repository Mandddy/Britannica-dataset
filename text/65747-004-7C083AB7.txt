Amsterdam 1928 Olympic Games, athletic festival held in Amsterdam, that took place May 17–Aug. 12, 1928. The Amsterdam Games were the eighth occurrence of the modern Olympic Games.
Track-and-field and gymnastics events were added to the women’s slate at the 1928 Olympics. There was much criticism of the decision, led by the baron de Coubertin and the Vatican. Women athletes, however, had formed their own track organizations and had held an Olympic-style women’s competition in 1922 and 1926. Their performances at these events convinced the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF; later International Association of Athletics Federations) that women were capable of a high level of athletic competition and deserved a place at the Olympics.
