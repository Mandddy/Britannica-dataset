Juan Gelman,  (born May 3, 1930, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died January 14, 2014, Mexico City, Mexico) Argentinian poet and leftist political activist who was exiled from his home country in the 1970s.
Gelman was jailed in the early 1960s during the Peronists’ struggle for control of the federal government in Argentina. From the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, he wrote for the magazines Panorama and Crisis in Buenos Aires. His political activism and his involvement with the Montoneros, a left-wing Peronist group that used violence in its efforts to overthrow the military government, resulted in his being forced into exile in Italy in 1975. He returned to Argentina briefly in 1988 before moving to Mexico.
