William Johnson,  (born December 27, 1771, Charleston, South Carolina [U.S.]—died August 4, 1834, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1804 who established the practice of rendering individual opinions—concurring or dissenting—in addition to the majority opinion of the court. A deeply sensitive man and a learned, courageous jurist, he set himself against the dominance exercised over the court by Chief Justice John Marshall.
After serving in the South Carolina House of Representatives (1794–99; speaker, 1798–99), Johnson was elected by the legislature to the Court of Common Pleas, at that time the highest tribunal in the state. During his tenure as a state judge he was active in organizing at Columbia a college that later became the University of South Carolina.
