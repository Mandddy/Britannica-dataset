Wentletrap, also called staircase shell, or ladder shell,  any marine snail of the family Epitoniidae (subclass Prosobranchia of the class Gastropoda), in which the turreted shell—consisting of whorls that form a high, conical spiral—has deeply ribbed sculpturing. Most species are white, less than 5 cm (2 inches) long, and exude a pink or purplish dye. Wentletraps occur in all seas, usually near sea anemones, from which they suck nourishment. The common wentletrap (Epitonium clathrus) occurs in European waters; the money wentletrap (E. indianorum) is common from Alaska to Mexico.
