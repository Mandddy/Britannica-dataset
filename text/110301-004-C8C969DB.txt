Diddy, original name Sean John Combs, bynames Sean “Puffy” Combs, Puff Daddy, and P. Diddy  (born November 4, 1970, New York, New York, U.S.) American rapper, record producer, and clothing designer who founded an entertainment empire in the 1990s.
Combs was born and raised in Harlem in New York City, where his father was murdered when Combs was three. Nine years later the family moved to suburban Mount Vernon, New York, where Combs attended prep school and supposedly received the nickname “Puffy” for his habit of puffing up his chest during football practice. He attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., but he left college after two years to become an intern at Uptown Records in New York City; within a year he had moved up to vice president. In December 1991, 9 people were crushed to death and 29 were injured as crowds pushed their way into a charity basketball game Combs had promoted at the City College of New York.
