Drams River, also called Drammens River, Norwegian Dramselva, or Drammenselva,  river, southeastern Norway. After rising on the southern slopes of the Halling Mountains as the Halling River and flowing east-northeast to the village of Gol, it flows south-southeast to Krøderen (lake) and thence southward to enter Drams Fjord at the city of Drammen after a course of 192 miles (309 km). The name Drams refers strictly to the lowest 30 miles (48 km) of the river (below Krøderen) but is also used for the whole river drainage system of 6,600 square miles (17,100 square km). Its flow is highly regulated by a series of hydroelectric facilities, and several paper and lumber mills adjoin the river.
