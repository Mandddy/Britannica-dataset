Moray, any of 80 or more species of eels of the family Muraenidae. Moray eels occur in all tropical and subtropical seas, where they live in shallow water among reefs and rocks and hide in crevices. They differ from other eels in having small rounded gill openings and in generally lacking pectoral fins. Their skin is thick, smooth, and scaleless, while the mouth is wide and the jaws are equipped with strong, sharp teeth, which enable them to seize and hold their prey (chiefly other fishes) but also to inflict serious wounds on their enemies, including humans. They are apt to attack humans only when disturbed, but then they can be quite vicious.
Moray eels are usually vividly marked or coloured. They generally do not exceed a length of about 1.5 metres (5 feet), but one species, Thyrsoidea macrurus of the Pacific, is known to grow about 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) long. Morays are eaten in some areas of the world, but their flesh is sometimes toxic and can cause illness or death. One species of moray, Muraena helena, found in the Mediterranean, was a great delicacy of the ancient Romans and was cultivated by them in seaside ponds.
