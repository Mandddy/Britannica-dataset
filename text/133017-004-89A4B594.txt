Fasilides, also spelled Fasilidas, Fasiladas, or Basilide  (died 1667) Ethiopian emperor from 1632 to 1667, who ended a period of contact between his country and Europe, initiating a policy of isolation that lasted for more than two centuries.
Fasilides succeeded to the throne on the abdication of Susenyos (1632), who had permitted an increase of Spanish and Roman Catholic influence in Ethiopia. Fasilides reestablished a close alliance between the Ethiopian Coptic Christian Church and the ruling house, expelled Catholic missionaries, and enlisted the aid of the Muslim rulers of the coastal states to bar all Europeans from the country. He also created a new capital at Gonder, in order to protect the throne from the danger of invasions by the Galla peoples of the south.
