Heavy oil and tar sand, crude oils below 20째 on the American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity scale that require mining or thermal recovery. Although the lighter conventional crudes are often waterflooded to enhance recovery, this method is essentially ineffective for heavy crudes between 20째 and 10째 API gravity, and thermal recovery becomes necessary. Heavy crude oils have enough mobility that, given time, they will be producible through a well bore in response to thermal recovery methods. Tar sands, which are less than 10째 API gravity and contain immobile bitumen, will not flow into a well bore even under thermal stimulation and thus require mining.
In ancient times the Elamites, Chaldeans, Akkadians, and Sumerians mined shallow deposits of asphalt, or bitumen, for their own use. Mesopotamian bitumen was exported to Egypt where it was employed for various purposes, including the preservation of mummies. The Dead Sea was known as Lake Asphaltites (from which the term asphalt was derived) because of the lumps of semisolid petroleum that were washed up on its shores from underwater seeps.
