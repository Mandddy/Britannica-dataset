Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, short-period comet discovered photographically by the German astronomers Friedrich Karl Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur Wachmann on November 15, 1927. It has one of the most circular orbits of any comet known (eccentricity = 0.044) and remains always between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, with an orbital period of 14.7 years. It is also remarkable for outbursts in its brightness, which sometimes increases by several magnitudes in a matter of hours. These outbursts are determined to be the result of the transient development of a coma (faint atmosphere) of gas and dust, but, because this event occurs at random points along the comet’s orbit, it cannot be explained by variations in solar heating of the comet’s nucleus. Rather, it is thought to be caused by either the transformation of amorphous water ice to crystalline ice in an exothermic reaction (one that gives off heat) or the sublimation of ices more volatile than water ice, such as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The solid nucleus of comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is estimated to be about 30 km (20 miles) in diameter.
