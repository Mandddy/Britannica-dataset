Asp, anglicized form of aspis, name used in classical antiquity for a venomous snake, probably the Egyptian cobra, Naja haje. It was the symbol of royalty in Egypt, and its bite was used for the execution of favoured criminals in Greco-Roman times. Cleopatra is said to have killed herself with an asp (see also viper).
European aspic vipers (Vipera aspis) of France, Switzerland, Spain, and Italy are often referred to as asps. Adult aspic vipers may reach 50 cm (20 inches) in total length, although most are smaller. They live in a variety of habitats ranging from sea level to high-altitude environments near 2,600 metres (8,500 feet) in the Swiss Alps. These animals prey on small vertebrates and give birth to a litter of 5â€“16 young.
