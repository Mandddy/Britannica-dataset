Argyllshire, also called Argyll, Gaelic Earraghaidheal (“Coastland of the Gael”),  historic county in western Scotland. Argyllshire lies mainly within the Argyll and Bute council area, but northern Argyllshire extends as far as Lochs Shiel, Eil, and Leven in southern Highland council area.
In the 2nd century ad Gaelic-speaking Scots invaded Argyllshire from Ireland, then known as Scotia. The earliest Scots settlement dates to the 3rd century, when a victorious chief, Cairbre Riada, occupied lands in the area later known as Mid Argyll. These lands, called Dalriada, received new bands of immigrants from time to time from Ireland. Dalriada developed gradually as an independent kingdom under ambitious rulers and maintained a separate existence until 843, when one of them—Kenneth MacAlpin, as Kenneth I—united the Scots of Dalriada with the Picts of northeastern Scotland, founding a new hybrid kingdom that eventually became Scotland. Later Norsemen obtained control and held sway until 1266, when Argyllshire was returned to the Scottish kingdom. Prior to this, however, semi-independent chiefs of mixed Celtic and Norse ancestry acquired power in Argyllshire and the Western Isles. One of them, Somerled, really the first Lord of the Isles, was killed near Renfrew in 1164 on an expedition against the Scottish king, but his descendants held the lordship of the Isles until 1493, when King James IV deprived John, the last MacDonald Lord of the Isles, of his vast estates. The Campbells of Lochow (now Lochawe) supplanted the MacDonalds, and their chiefs became earls of Argyll.
