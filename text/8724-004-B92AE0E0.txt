Wolffish, any of five species of large long-bodied fishes of the family Anarhichadidae (order Perciformes), found in northern Atlantic and Pacific waters. The largest species may grow to a length of about 2.3 metres (7.5 feet). Wolffishes have a large head and a long tapered body surmounted by a single long dorsal fin. Their formidable teeth consist of large canines and heavy molars capable of handling a diet of crabs, starfishes, sea urchins, and other prey.
Wolffishes are found from the shoreline to depths of 300 metres or more. Known as catfishes in Europe, they are taken there and in the United States for food. Species include the Atlantic wolffish (Anarhichas lupus), a vertically banded North Atlantic species; the spotted wolffish, or spotted catfish (A. minor), also of the North Atlantic; and the wolf-eel (Anarhichthys ocellatus), a black-spotted form found in the eastern Pacific.
