Property tax, levy that is imposed primarily upon land and buildings. In some countries, including the United States, the tax is also imposed on business and farm equipment and inventories. Sometimes the tax extends to automobiles, jewelry, and furniture and even to such intangibles as bonds, mortgages, and shares of stock that represent claims on, or ownership of, tangible wealth. The amount payable is based not on a person’s or a company’s total net wealth but on gross value without regard to debts.
Levies not ordinarily classified as property taxes are those on the transfer of property (by sale, gift, or death), special charges for some public service or improvement (such as special assessments in the United States), certain types of agricultural imposts, and portions of income taxes that apply to presumed or actual yield of farm or urban land.
