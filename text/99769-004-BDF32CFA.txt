Caligula, byname of Gaius Caesar, in full Gaius Caesar Germanicus  (born August 31 12 ce, Antium, Latium—died January 24, 41, Rome) Roman emperor from 37 to 41 ce, in succession to Tiberius, who effected the transfer of the last legion that had been under a senatorial proconsul (in Africa) to an imperial legate, thus completing the emperor’s monopoly of army command. Accounts of his reign by ancient historians are so biased against him that the truth is almost impossible to disentangle.
Born Gaius Caesar, he became known as Caligula (“Little Boot”), a childhood nickname bestowed on him by the soldiers of his father, Germanicus Caesar, nephew and adoptive son of Tiberius. The deaths of his father in 19 ce, of his mother, Agrippina the Elder, in 33, and of his two elder brothers, Julius Caesar Nero in 31 and Drusus Caesar in 23, were popularly ascribed to the machinations of Tiberius. Gaius and his three sisters survived. Adopting his father’s distinguished name, he became Gaius Caesar Germanicus.
