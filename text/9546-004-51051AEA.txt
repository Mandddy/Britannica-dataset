Sailfish (genus Istiophorus),  (genus ), valued food and game fish of the family Istiophoridae (order Perciformes) found in warm and temperate waters around the world. The sailfish has a long, rounded spear extending from its snout but is distinguished from related species, such as marlins, by its slimmer form, long pelvic fins, and, most especially, its large sail-like dorsal fin. It is a deep blue fish, silvery below, with a bright blue, spotted dorsal fin. Size ranges to about 3.4 metres (11 feet) and 90 kg (200 pounds) or more. It feeds mainly on other fishes. The classification of the sailfish is uncertain. Some systems recognize two separate species: the Indo-Pacific sailfish (I. platypterus) and the Atlantic sailfish (I. albicans).
