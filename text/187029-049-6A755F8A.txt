Coal tar, principal liquid product resulting from the carbonization of coal, i.e., the heating of coal in the absence of air, at temperatures ranging from about 900 to 1,200 째C (1,650 to 2,200 째F). Many commercially important compounds are derived from coal tar.
Low-temperature tars result when coal, peat, lignite, or wood are carbonized at temperatures not exceeding 700 째C (1,300 째F). Tar acids, phenolic compounds that react with caustic soda to form water-soluble salts, are extracted from coal tar after it has been distilled.
