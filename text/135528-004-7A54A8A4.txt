Mehmed VI, original name Mehmed Vahideddin  (born Jan. 14, 1861—died  May 16, 1926, San Remo, Italy) the last sultan of the Ottoman Empire, whose forced abdication and exile in 1922 prepared the way for the emergence of the Turkish Republic under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk within a year.
Clever and perceptive, Mehmed VI became sultan July 4, 1918, and attempted to follow the example of his elder brother Abdülhamid II (reigned 1876–1909) by assuming personal control of the government. After the Armistice of Mudros (Oct. 30, 1918) and the establishment of the Allied military administration in Istanbul on Dec. 8, 1918, the nationalist–liberal Committee of Union and Progress had collapsed, and its leaders had fled abroad. The Sultan, opposed to all nationalist ideologies and anxious to perpetuate the Ottoman dynasty, acceded to the demands of the Allies. On December 21 he dissolved Parliament and undertook to crush the nationalists.
