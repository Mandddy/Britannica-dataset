Radioactive series, any of four independent sets of unstable heavy atomic nuclei that decay through a sequence of alpha and beta decays until a stable nucleus is achieved. These four chains of consecutive parent and daughter nuclei begin and end among elements with atomic numbers higher than 81, which is the atomic weight of thallium; the members of each set are genetically related by alpha and beta decay. Three of the sets, the thorium series, uranium series, and actinium series, called natural or classical series, are headed by naturally occurring species of unstable nuclei that have half-lives comparable to the age of the elements. By 1935 these three radioactive series had been fully delineated. The fourth set, the neptunium series, is headed by neptunium-237, which has a half-life of 2,000,000 years. Its members are produced artificially by nuclear reactions and do not occur naturally; all their half-lives are short compared with the age of the elements.
Because the two pertinent decay processes result either in no change or in a change of four units in the mass number, the mass numbers of all the members of each series are divisible by four, with a constant remainder. Within each series, therefore, the mass number of the members may be expressed as four times an appropriate integer (n) plus the constant for that series; thus, the thorium series is sometimes called the 4n series; the neptunium series, 4n + 1; the uranium series, 4n + 2; and the actinium series, 4n + 3.
