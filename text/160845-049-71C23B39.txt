Transit, in astronomy, the passage of a relatively small body across the disk of a larger body, usually a star or a planet, occulting only a very small area. Mercury and Venus periodically transit the Sun, and a moon may transit its planet. Extrasolar planets (e.g., HD 209458b) have been discovered when they perform a transit of their stars. Compare eclipse.
A transit of Mercury or Venus across the face of the Sun, as seen from Earth, occurs at inferior conjunction, when the planet lies between the Sun and Earth. Because the orbits of both planets are inclined to the ecliptic, these planets usually pass above or below the Sun. Each planetâ€™s orbit intersects the ecliptic plane in two points called nodes; if inferior conjunction occurs at a time when the planet is near a node, a transit of the Sun can occur.
