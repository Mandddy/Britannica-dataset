Adenoids, also called Pharyngeal Tonsils,  a mass of lymphatic tissue, similar to the (palatine) tonsils, that is attached to the back wall of the nasal pharynx (i.e., the upper part of the throat opening into the nasal cavity proper). An individual fold of such nasopharyngeal lymphatic tissue is called an adenoid.
The surface layer of the adenoids consists of ciliated epithelial cells covered by a thin film of mucus. The cilia, which are microscopic hairlike projections from the surface cells, move constantly in a wavelike manner and propel the blanket of mucus down to the pharynx proper. From that point the mucus is caught by the swallowing action of the pharyngeal (throat) muscles and is sent down to the stomach. The adenoids also contain glands that secrete mucus to replenish the surface film. The function of the adenoids is protective. The moving film of mucus tends to carry infectious agents and dust particles inhaled through the nose down to the pharynx, where the epithelium is more resistant. Immune substances, or antibodies, are thought to be formed within the lymphatic tissue, which, combined with phagocytic action, tends to arrest and absorb infectious agents.
