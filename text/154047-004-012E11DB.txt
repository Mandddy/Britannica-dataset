Britannic, in full His Majestyâ€™s Hospital Ship (HMHS) Britannic,  British liner that was a sister ship of the Olympic and the Titanic. Never operating as a commercial vessel, it was refitted as a hospital ship during World War I and sank in 1916 after reportedly striking a mine.
The Britannic was built by the Belfast firm of Harland and Wolff as part of a class of transatlantic luxury liners for the White Star Line. The class, which was designed for comfort rather than speed, was conceived in 1907 and initially included only the Olympic and Titanic. The third ship was added later, and it was planned to be larger and more luxurious than its sister ships. On November 30, 1911, construction began with the laying of the keel. After the Titanic sank in April 1912, however, the ship was redesigned to incorporate various safety modifications. Notably, more lifeboats were added, and its watertight compartments (which featured doors that allowed the sections to be isolated from each other) were increased to 17 in number, 5 of which were raised from E deck to B deck. In addition, its name was reportedly changed from Gigantic to Britannic. After the hull was completed, the ship was launched on February 26, 1914. The Britannic was scheduled to begin its commercial service the following year. However, with the start of World War I in 1914, the Britannic was requisitioned as a hospital ship in 1915. Upon its completion, the ship measured approximately 882 feet (269 metres) in length and had a gross tonnage of 48,158.
