Constantin Meunier, in full Constantin Emile Meunier  (born April 12, 1831, Etterbeek, Belgium—died April 4, 1905, Ixelles) Belgian sculptor and painter, one of the principal social-realist artists of the late 19th century in Europe.
Meunier began his career as a sculptor, but during the years 1857–84 he pursued only painting. After visiting some mines and factories, Meunier demonstrated in his paintings a humanitarian interest in labourers, focusing particularly on the miners of the Borinage, dockworkers of Antwerp, metalworkers, and women labourers.
