Dennis M. Ritchie,  (born September 9, 1941, Bronxville, Eastchester, New York, U.S.—found dead October 2011, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey) American computer scientist and cowinner of the 1983 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science. Ritchie and the American computer scientist Kenneth L. Thompson were cited jointly for “their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system,” which they developed together at Bell Laboratories.
Ritchie earned a bachelor’s degree (1963) in physics and a doctorate (1968) in mathematics from Harvard University. In 1967 he joined Bell Labs, where he first worked on the Multics operating system (OS). Multics was a time-sharing system funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and jointly developed by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric Co. However, AT&amp;T Corporation (then the parent company of Bell Labs) withdrew from the project and removed its GE computers in 1969.
