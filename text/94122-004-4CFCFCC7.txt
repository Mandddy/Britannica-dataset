Carbon dioxide, (CO2), a colourless gas having a faint, sharp odour and a sour taste; it is a minor component of Earth’s atmosphere (about 3 volumes in 10,000), formed in combustion of carbon-containing materials, in fermentation, and in respiration of animals and employed by plants in the photosynthesis of carbohydrates. The presence of the gas in the atmosphere keeps some of the radiant energy received by Earth from being returned to space, thus producing the so-called greenhouse effect. Industrially, it is recovered for numerous diverse applications from flue gases, as a by-product of the preparation of hydrogen for synthesis of ammonia, from limekilns, and from other sources.
Carbon dioxide was recognized as a gas different from others early in the 17th century by a Belgian chemist, Jan Baptista van Helmont, who observed it as a product of both fermentation and combustion. It liquefies upon compression to 75 kg per square centimetre (1,071 pounds per square inch) at 31 °C (87.4 °F) or to 16–24 kg per sq cm (230–345 lb per sq in.) at −23 to −12 °C (−10 to 10 °F). By the mid-20th century, most carbon dioxide was sold as the liquid. If the liquid is allowed to expand to atmospheric pressure, it cools and partially freezes to a snowlike solid called dry ice that sublimes (passes directly into vapour without melting) at −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) at the pressure of the normal atmosphere.
