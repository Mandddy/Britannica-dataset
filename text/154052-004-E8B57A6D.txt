The King and I, American musical film, released in 1956, that was scored by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein and features a signature performance by Yul Brynner, who had earlier starred in the hit Broadway adaptation.
Brynner portrayed the king of Siam, an imperious monarch who is seen as immortal by his people. However, he becomes all too human and prone to self-doubt when he meets Anna (played by Deborah Kerr), a “proper” English widow who has traveled to Siam to serve as his children’s governess, teaching them the ways of the Western world. Despite their vastly different backgrounds, Anna and the king learn to respect and even admire each other.
