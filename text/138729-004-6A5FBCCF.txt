Ball, spherical or ovoid object for throwing, hitting, or kicking in various sports and games. The ball is mentioned in the earliest recorded literatures and finds a place in some of the oldest graphic representations of play. It is one of the earliest children’s toys known.
A ball can be made from many different materials, leather, rubber, and synthetics being most common in modern times. However, balls made from indigenous materials, particularly from animal parts, were once the norm. For instance, among the Yahgan (or Yámana) of South America a ball called a kalaka was made from an albatross web (foot) that was blown up and stuffed with goose feathers and sewn. The Yahgan also used an inflated seal stomach as a ball. Among the Navajo of North America, balls were made from buckskin bags filled with seeds and held together by a drawstring.
