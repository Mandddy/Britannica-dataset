Mencius, (Latin), Chinese (Pinyin) Mengzi or (Wade-Giles) Meng-tzu, original name (Wade-Giles) Meng K’o  (born c. 371, ancient state of Zou, China—died c. 289 bce, China) early Chinese philosopher whose development of orthodox Confucianism earned him the title “second sage.” Chief among his basic tenets was an emphasis on the obligation of rulers to provide for the common people. The book Mencius records his doings and sayings and contains statements on the goodness of human nature, a topic warmly debated by Confucianists up to modern times.
Of noble origin, the Meng family settled in the state of Zou, a minor state in the present province of Shantung. Mencius was born there about 372 bce. In several respects his life was similar to that of Confucius. Zou and Lu (the state of Confucius’ origin) were adjacent states. Like Confucius, Mencius was only three when he lost his father. Mencius’ mother paid special attention to the upbringing of her young son. A traditional story tells of her moving their home several times and finally settling near a school, so that the boy should have the right kind of environmental influence, and of her encouraging her son to persevere in his studies. Among the Chinese, the mother of Mencius has been for ages upheld as the model mother.
