William Vaughn Moody,  (born July 8, 1869, Spencer, Ind., U.S.â€”died Oct. 17, 1910, Colorado Springs, Colo.) American poet and playwright whose mystical and dignified work was considered a sign of unfulfilled promise upon his early death.
After he graduated from Harvard University (1893), Moody was an instructor of English at Harvard and then at the University of Chicago. Though he was considered an inspiring teacher, Moody disliked his job; he spent several years of his university association working elsewhere on the Cambridge edition of the works of John Milton. The publication in 1902 of a textbook that he coauthored enabled Moody to pursue the writing career that he preferred.
