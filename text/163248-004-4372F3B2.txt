The history of Widener began in 1821 with the establishment in Wilmington of Bullock School, a Quaker school for boys. The school changed names twice between 1846 and 1859, when it became the Delaware Military Academy. When the academy moved to Chester in 1862, it became Chester County Military Academy, changing its name later that year to Pennsylvania Military Academy. In order to reflect the school’s growing academic mission, its name was changed to Pennsylvania Military College in 1892. In 1966 the college was split into the military college for cadets and the new Pennsylvania Morton College for noncadets, including women. The two colleges were collectively known as the PMC Colleges. In 1972 the cadet corps was disbanded, and the school’s name was changed to Widener College. University status was achieved in 1979. The Wilmington and Harrisburg branches opened in 1976 and 1988, respectively. The Exton campus opened in 2004.
