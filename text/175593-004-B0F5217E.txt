Richard Lester,  (born January 19, 1932, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American filmmaker who successfully transferred the fast-cut stream-of-consciousness style of television commercials to the big screen.
A piano prodigy, Lester continued his musical activities while pursuing a psychology degree at the University of Pennsylvania. He traveled to Europe in 1954, ostensibly as a “roving correspondent” for a newspaper syndicate, and paid his way by playing guitar and piano. Within a year he was at London’s Independent Television studios, again as a composer and director. He hosted his own one-shot Dick Lester Show in 1956, which though a disaster led to a series of choice directorial assignments on the various television projects of The Goon Show cocreators Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers. Also during this period, he began directing commercials, an activity to which he would periodically return throughout his career.
