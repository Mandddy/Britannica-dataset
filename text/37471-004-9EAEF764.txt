Thomas Osborne, 1st duke of Leeds, in full Thomas Osborne, 1st duke of Leeds, marquess of Carmarthen, earl of Danby, Viscount Latimer of Danby, Viscount Osborne of Dunblane, Baron Osborne of Kiveton, also called (1647–73) Sir Thomas Osborne, 2nd Baronet  (born February 20, 1632—died July 26, 1712, Easton Neston, Northamptonshire, England) English statesman who, while chief minister to King Charles II, organized the Tories in Parliament. In addition he played a key role in bringing William and Mary to the English throne in 1689.
The son of a Royalist Yorkshire landowner, Osborne did not become active in politics until Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. He then held local posts in Yorkshire, and in 1665 he won a seat in Parliament. Advancing in office through the patronage of the influential George Villiers, 2nd duke of Buckingham, Osborne became joint treasurer of the Royal Navy in 1668 and lord treasurer of England in 1673. His success in stabilizing the government’s financial position soon made him Charles’s chief minister and earned him the title earl of Danby (June 1674).
