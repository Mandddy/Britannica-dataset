Judd Apatow,  (born December 6, 1967, Syosset, New York, U.S.) American writer, director, and producer known for creating offbeat comedies featuring unconventional protagonists.
Apatow was a self-described awkward, undersized child who was always picked last for school sports teams. He was deeply scarred as a youth by his parentsâ€™ divorce, and his anger over their breakup would become a recurring theme in his later work. He found his niche as the host of Club Comedy, a radio show at Syosset High School, in which he interviewed established professional comedians, including Garry Shandling, Steven Wright, and Jerry Seinfeld. At age 16 he began working as a dishwasher at a comedy club and soon launched his own stand-up act.
