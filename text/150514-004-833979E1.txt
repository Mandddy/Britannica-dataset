Zawahiri was raised in Maʿādī, Egypt, several miles south of Cairo. Although his parents were from prominent families, Zawahiri and his siblings were raised in a relatively humble environment. Zawahiri was a pious youth. As a student, he was greatly influenced by the work of Sayyid Quṭb, an Egyptian writer who was one of the foremost figures in modern Sunni Islamic revivalism. By age 15 Zawahiri had established a group dedicated to the overthrow of the Egyptian government in favour of Islamic rule.
