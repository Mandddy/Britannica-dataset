Pigeon River, river that rises on the slopes of the Blue Ridge in Pisgah National Forest, western North Carolina, U.S., and flows over a course of 100 miles (160 km). It travels northward past Canton and Clyde and continues around the eastern side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where it is dammed to form Waterville Lake. Between the lake and the Tennessee state line, the river is diverted through a 6-mile- (10-km-) long tunnel to a hydroelectric plant. In eastern Tennessee the river joins the French Broad River near Douglas Reservoir.
