Unity, new religious movement founded in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1889 by Charles Fillmore (1854–1948), a real-estate agent, and his wife, Myrtle (1845–1931). Mrs. Fillmore believed that spiritual healing had cured her of tuberculosis. As a result, the Fillmores began studying spiritual healing. They were deeply influenced by Emma Curtis Hopkins, a former follower of Mary Baker Eddy, who founded Christian Science. Unity, however, is closer to New Thought, which in general emphasizes the primacy of mind and spiritual healing, than it is to Christian Science. Until 1922 it was a member of the International New Thought Alliance.
Unity developed gradually as the Fillmores attempted to share their insights concerning religion and spiritual healing. They began publishing magazines, books, and pamphlets and started the service known as Silent Unity, which, through prayer and counselling, helps people by telephone, via mail, and online. As the work and the number of employees increased, Unity moved several times within Kansas City. After World War I, the Fillmores began developing Unity Village, 15 miles from Kansas City and eventually covering 1,400 acres, and by 1949 all departments of Unity were located there. After Charles Fillmore’s death, Unity was led by the Fillmores’ sons and grandchildren.
