Michał Heller, in full Michał Kazimierz Heller  (born March 12, 1936, Tarnow, Pol.) Roman Catholic priest and mathematical cosmologist who championed a world view that combined mathematical physics, theology, and philosophy.
Heller was born in southern Poland. When he was four years old, his father helped to sabotage the chemical plant in which he worked, and the family fled to the U.S.S.R. to escape the advancing Nazi invaders. During a roundup of Polish refugees, the Hellers were sent to a labour camp in Sakha (Yakutia) in Siberia, where they withstood the attendant hardships chiefly through fortitude and their strong Roman Catholic faith. After World War II they were sent back to Poland, where in 1953 Heller completed his secondary schooling and entered the seminary in Tarnow. Having received a master’s degree in theology and taken ordination in 1959, he was given a parish near his hometown.
