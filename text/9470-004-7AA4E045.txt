Domenico Scarlatti, in full Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti  (born October 26, 1685, Naples [Italy]—died July 23, 1757, Madrid, Spain) Italian composer noted particularly for his 555 keyboard sonatas, which substantially expanded the technical and musical possibilities of the harpsichord.
Domenico, the son of the famous composer of vocal music Alessandro Scarlatti, was born in the same year as J.S. Bach and G.F. Handel. At age 15 he secured an appointment as organist in Naples. In 1703 his first operas, L’Ottavia restituita al trono and Il Giustino, were produced there. In 1705 his father sent him away from Naples to Venice, reputedly to study with the composer Francesco Gasparini. While in Venice, Scarlatti may have met a young Irishman, Thomas Roseingrave, who many years later described Domenico’s harpsichord playing to the English musicologist Charles Burney as sounding as if “ten hundred d…s had been at the instrument; he had never heard such passages of execution and effect before.” Scarlatti may have also formed a friendship with Handel while in Venice.
