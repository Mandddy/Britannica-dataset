Stalag 17, American war film, released in 1953, that was directed by Billy Wilder and featured an Academy Award-winning performance by William Holden.
The film is set in a German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag 17, during World War II. It tracks the daily boredom and nighttime escape attempts of the resident U.S. airmen. The camp is run by a sadistic commandant, Oberst von Scherbach (played by Otto Preminger), whose orders are carried out by his avuncular but dutiful sergeant, Johann Sebastian Schulz (Sig Ruman). The leader of the POWs is a cynical loner, the wisecracking Sgt. J.J. Sefton (Holden), who callously bets on the chances of escaping POWs and barters with the German guards for various “luxuries,” such as soap and eggs. When two inmates are shot and killed by German guards who seemingly had an advance notice of their escape, the prisoners become convinced that Sefton is a Nazi informant, and they beat him. Sefton soon learns the identity of the real traitor: the barrack’s German-born, blond-haired, blue-eyed security chief, Sergeant Price (Peter Graves), whose English is impeccable and who appears to be the “all-American boy.” Price denies it, but, when he fails to answer a question correctly about the timing of the attack on Pearl Harbor, his cover is blown. The inmates throw Price into the courtyard with tin cans tied to his legs, and camp guards immediately shoot and kill him, thinking he is an inmate attempting to escape. During the commotion, Sefton and Lieut. James Dunbar (Don Taylor) make their own escape. Their successful breakout and the killing of Price lift the morale of the remaining POWs.
