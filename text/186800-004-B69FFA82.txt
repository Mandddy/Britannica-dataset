Leonard Nimoy, in full Leonard Simon Nimoy  (born March 26, 1931, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 27, 2015, Los Angeles, California) American actor known for his portrayal of the stoic, cerebral Mr. Spock in the science fiction television and film franchise Star Trek.
Nimoy, the second son of Jewish immigrants from Izyaslav, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine), grew up in a tenement in Boston’s West End neighbourhood. As a child, he began acting in community theatre productions. Nimoy briefly attended Boston College before heading to California in 1949, where he studied at the Pasadena Playhouse. He began auditioning for film and television parts and was cast in bit roles in such movies as Queen for a Day (1951) and the serial Zombies of the Stratosphere (1952). He assumed the starring role in the boxing melodrama Kid Monk Baroni (1952) before enlisting in the army reserve in 1953; he continued to appear in productions during his free time. Nimoy eventually convinced his superiors to transfer him to Atlanta, where, as an entertainment specialist, he wrote and directed television and radio variety programs for the troops. Following the completion of his service in 1955, he returned to California. In 1958 he began taking acting lessons from blacklisted actor Jeff Corey and, later, teaching at his own studio.
