Kabul Museum, also called National Museum of Afghanistan,  national museum in Darulaman, outside of Kabul, Afghanistan, displaying art and artifacts related to the country’s history and heritage.
Founded in 1924 and first housed in Koti Baghcha, a royal palace in Kabul, the museum moved to its current location in 1931. The Kabul Museum houses a wide variety of archaeological and artistic items representing Afghanistan’s rich and varied past. The diversity of the museum’s collection is a result of Afghanistan’s location along the ancient Silk Road, an important trade route linking Asia to Europe and the Middle East, which brought a wide variety of goods, as well as new ideas, to the region. The museum’s permanent collection included objects such as Neanderthal remains, Buddhist stucco sculptures, and ancient Hindu marble statuary. It held a restored statue of King Kaniska and a collection of Bactrian gold objects (100 bce to 100 ce) that were excavated in northern Afghanistan in the late 1970s. The museum also housed one of the world’s most significant collections of Greek and Roman coins.
