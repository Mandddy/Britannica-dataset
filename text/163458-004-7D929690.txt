August Wilhelm Ambros,  (born Nov. 17, 1816, Vysoké Mýto, near Prague—died  June 28, 1876, Vienna) musicologist, author of Geschichte der Musik, a comprehensive history of music.
Ambros studied law, entered the civil service in 1840, and became public prosecutor in Prague in 1850. A keen, well-trained musician and composer of a Czech opera, Bretislaw a Jitka, he also established himself as a brilliant writer on music. His pamphlet Über die Grenzen der Poesie und Musik (1856) contributed to a heated aesthetic controversy. In 1869 he became professor of music at Prague and, in 1872, of music history at Vienna. His Geschichte der Musik, incomplete at his death, covered antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Scholars completed the work from his notes.
