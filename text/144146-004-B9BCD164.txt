Foucault pendulum, relatively large mass suspended from a long line mounted so that its perpendicular plane of swing is not confined to a particular direction and, in fact, rotates in relation to the Earth’s surface. In 1851 the French physicist Jean-Bernard-Léon Foucault assembled in Paris the first pendulums of this type, one of which consisted of a 28-kg (62-pound) iron ball suspended from inside the dome of the Panthéon by a steel wire 67 metres (220 feet) long and set in motion by drawing the ball to one side and carefully releasing it to start it swinging in a plane. The rotation of the plane of swing of Foucault’s pendulums was the first laboratory demonstration of the Earth’s spin on its axis.
While a Foucault pendulum swings back and forth in a plane, the Earth rotates beneath it, so that relative motion exists between them. At the North Pole, latitude 90° N, the relative motion as viewed from above in the plane of the pendulum’s suspension is a counterclockwise rotation of the Earth once approximately every 24 hours (more precisely, once every 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds, the length of a sidereal day). Correspondingly, the plane of the pendulum as viewed from above appears to rotate in a clockwise direction once a day. A Foucault pendulum always rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere with a rate that becomes slower as the pendulum’s location approaches the Equator. Foucault’s original pendulums at Paris rotated clockwise at a rate of more than 11° per hour, or with a period of about 32 hours per complete rotation. The rate of rotation depends on the latitude. At the Equator, 0° latitude, a Foucault pendulum does not rotate. In the Southern Hemisphere, rotation is counterclockwise.
