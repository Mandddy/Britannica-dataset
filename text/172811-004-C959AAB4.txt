Gaston Paris, in full Bruno-Paulin-Gaston Paris  (born August 9, 1839, Avenay, France—died March 6, 1903, Cannes) greatest French philologist of his age.
After a thorough education in German universities (notably under Friedrich Diez in Bonn) and at the École des Chartes in Paris, he succeeded his father as professor of French medieval literature at the Collège de France. He was one of the founders and directors—with Paul Meyer—of Revue critique and of Romania, the leading journal devoted to French philology.
