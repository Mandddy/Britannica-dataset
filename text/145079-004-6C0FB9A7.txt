Gemini Observatory, observatory consisting of two 8.1-metre (27-foot) telescopes: the Frederick C. Gillett Gemini Telescope (also called Gemini North), located on the dormant volcano Mauna Kea (4,213 metres [13,822 feet]) on the island of Hawaii in the Northern Hemisphere, and Gemini South, located at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory on Cerro Pachon (2,725 metres [8,940 feet]) in Chile in the Southern Hemisphere. The observatory is named after the constellation Gemini, which represents the twins Castor and Pollux. One telescope was built in each hemisphere so that the Gemini Observatory would not be restricted by geography in the objects that it could observe. The two telescopes have been optimized for observations at infrared wavelengths by having their primary mirrors coated with silver, which does not emit as much thermal infrared radiation as the more commonly used aluminum coatings. The telescopes have adaptive optics systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence that can blur images. Construction on the two telescopes began in 1994. Gemini North and South made their first observations in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Astronomers using the Gemini telescopes have discovered that stars with planets have lower amounts of lithium than stars without and that ice volcanoes are replenishing the frozen surface of Plutoâ€™s moon Charon. The Gemini Observatory is funded by a consortium of seven countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
