Marriage, Italian Style, Italian Matrimonio all’italiana,  Italian romantic comedy film, released in 1964, that was directed by Vittorio De Sica and based on a play by Eduardo De Filippo. It established Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni as one of the most popular screen couples in international film.
Loren portrayed Filumena Marturano, the longtime mistress of successful businessman Domenico Soriano (played by Mastroianni), who saved her from a life of prostitution when she was still in her teens. Though happy to share a bed with her and to let her work for him, Domenico is unwilling to marry her. When she realizes that he is turning his attentions toward another woman, Filumena resorts to faking a fatal illness in order to lure him to the altar. Upon discovering the ruse, he charges her with fraud—but the resourceful Filumena is able to outsmart him yet again, using her own children’s dubious paternity as bait.
