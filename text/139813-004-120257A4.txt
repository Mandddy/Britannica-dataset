Gulbenkian Museum, in full Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, Portuguese Museo Calouste Gulbenkian,  museum in Lisbon, Port., featuring a renowned and eclectic collection of ancient and modern art.
The Gulbenkian’s collection was amassed by Calouste Gulbenkian during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. An Armenian oil magnate, Gulbenkian ranks among the world’s greatest art collectors. At the time of his death in 1955, his collection included more than 6,000 artifacts. These he willed to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation—set up to preserve and display his collection—in Lisbon, where he had spent the last 13 years of his life. His collection was displayed publicly for the first time in 1969, when the Gulbenkian Museum opened its doors.
