Sangamon River, river in central Illinois, U.S. It rises near Ellsworth in McLean county and flows briefly southeast. It then curves southwest, bending around Decatur, where a dam impounds Lake Decatur, and turns west to pass near Springfield, the state capital, and then north and west to join the Illinois River just north of Beardstown after a course of about 240 miles (385 km). The river drains an area of some 5,400 square miles (14,000 square km). The Sangamon’s main tributaries are Salt Creek and South Fork Sangamon River. The first Illinois home (1830) of Abraham Lincoln was a few miles southwest of Decatur on a bluff above the river; the site is now the Lincoln Trail Homestead State Memorial. In 1831 Lincoln moved to New Salem on the Sangamon River, about 20 miles (30 km) northwest of Springfield. That site is now within Lincoln’s New Salem State Historic Site. Along the river at Monticello is Robert Allerton Park, a 1,500-acre (600-hectare) area with nature trails and landscaped gardens.
