Broadbill, any of about 15 species of Old World tropical birds belonging to the family Eurylaimidae, order Passeriformes. Broadbills are monogamous and differ from all other passerines (perching birds) in the arrangement of the leg muscles that bend the toes.
Broadbills are chunky birds, 12.5 to 28 cm (5 to 11 inches) long, with a short, wide bill having bristles or wattles at the base. They live in forests or swamps, but many visit gardens. All have loud voices—some whistle, others croak—and several produce sounds by wing whirring or bill snapping. Broadbills make pear-shaped, hanging nests, usually over water, with a porched side entrance near the top.
