Alec Waugh, byname of Alexander Raban Waugh   (born July 8, 1898, Hampstead, London—died  Sept. 3, 1981, Tampa, Fla., U.S.) English popular novelist and travel writer, older brother of the writer Evelyn Waugh.
Waugh was educated at Sherborne, from which he was expelled, and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. While only 17, he wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel about public school life that created a considerable stir and was responsible for his brother Evelyn’s being sent to Lancing rather than following him to Sherborne. During World War I he served in France and was taken prisoner. After the war he worked as a publisher’s reader until 1926, when he went to Tahiti. His love for tropical countries left its stamp on many of his novels. Island in the Sun (1956) explores the emotional and political problems between blacks and whites on a West Indian island. The Mule on the Minaret (1965) was based on the activities of British counterintelligence in the Middle East. My Brother Evelyn and Other Profiles (1967) is largely autobiographical. Waugh’s later novels include A Spy in the Family (1970), The Fatal Gift (1973), and A Year to Remember (1975). He married three times, the last to U.S. novelist and prize-winning children’s author Virginia Sorenson.
