Australian Aboriginal languages, family of some 200 to 300 indigenous languages spoken in Australia and a few small offshore islands by approximately 50,000 people. Many of the languages are already extinct, and some are spoken by only dwindling numbers of elderly people, but a few are still vigorous. There is currently a resurgence of ethnic pride among Aboriginals, and government programs that assist Aboriginal peoples in maintaining their languages and becoming literate in them have sprung up. Evidence of this ethnic and linguistic pride can be seen in the preference of many indigenous Australians for the use of such self-designations as Koori (also spelled Koorie, meaning “person”) rather than the terms Aborigine and Aboriginal, which were imposed upon them (see Researcher’s Note: Aborigines and self-designation). Another linguistic trend is the use of a distinctive Aboriginal English (which might arguably be classified as a creole and is called Kriol) in some areas.
Australian Aboriginal languages are a unique language group, having no generally accepted genetic connections with non-Australian languages. (Despite its name, the Austronesian language family does not include Australian Aboriginal languages.) This uniqueness is probably the result of geographic isolation: archaeological evidence indicates that Australia has been inhabited for at least 40,000 years, and there is little sign of influxes of new inhabitants or even of extensive cultural contact with other Pacific peoples (except locally in the Torres Strait Islands, which are between northern Queensland and Papua New Guinea). Although Australian languages have a fairly clear grammatical and phonological profile, the great length of time over which they developed makes reconstructing Proto-Australian challenging.
