Izaak Walton,  (born August 9, 1593, Stafford, Staffordshire, England—died December 15, 1683, Winchester, Hampshire) English biographer and author of The Compleat Angler (1653), a pastoral discourse on the joys and stratagems of fishing that has been one of the most frequently reprinted books in English literature.
After a few years of schooling, Walton was apprenticed to a kinsman in the linendrapers’ trade in London, where he acquired a small shop of his own and began to prosper. Despite his modest education he read widely, developed scholarly tastes, and associated with men of learning. Walton lived and worked close to St. Dunstan’s Church, and he became active in parish affairs and a friend and fishing companion of the vicar, John Donne. Donne died in 1631, and, when his poems were published two years later, Walton composed “An Elegie” for the volume. In 1640 he wrote The Life and Death of Dr. Donne to accompany a collection of Donne’s sermons. The Life was revised and enlarged in 1658.
