Thomas Sackville, 1st earl of Dorset, also called (1567–1604) Baron Buckhurst of Buckhurst  (born 1536, Buckhurst, Sussex, England—died April 19, 1608, London) English statesman, poet, and dramatist, remembered largely for his share in two achievements of significance in the development of Elizabethan poetry and drama: the collection A Myrrour for Magistrates (1563) and the tragedy Gorboduc (1561).
Sackville settled in London in 1553. In 1558 he became a barrister and entered Parliament. He began an extended visit to Italy c. 1563 and returned upon his father’s death in 1566. The next year he was created baron of Buckhurst. He continued to serve the government, becoming a member of the Privy Council in 1585; he conveyed the death sentence to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1586. He served on several diplomatic missions to The Hague and became chancellor of the University of Oxford (1591) and lord high treasurer (1599; conferred for life in 1603). He was created a knight and a baron in 1567 and earl of Dorset in 1604. His house in Kent, Knole, is one of the great buildings of the age.
