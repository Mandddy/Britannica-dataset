Hula Hoop, hoop-shaped toy, typically a hollow plastic tube, that is kept revolving around the waist by swiveling of the hips. It got its name from the hula, a Hawaiian dance that is performed by using a similar hip motion. Although different variations of the hoop have been used as children’s toys since ancient times, in the 1950s Australian businessman Alex Tolmer was the first person to market a version made from a then-new material called plastic. In his Australian department store, Toltoys, Tolmer sold hundreds of thousands of Hula Hoops. American entrepreneurs Richard Knerr and Arthur Melin, the owners of the American toy company WHAM-O, purchased American rights. The company introduced the Hula Hoop to children in southern California in 1958. Seen on television news segments and variety shows, the Hula Hoop rapidly became a national and international fad. Sales of the original Hula-hoop were estimated to have reached 100 million in the United States alone in only two years, but they had declined significantly by the end of the decade. In 1965 WHAM-O released another version of the toy—this one containing ball bearings within the tube that made noise as the hoop swiveled around—and it is this version that continues to be marketed today.
The Hula Hoop made a comeback in the late 1980s, but sales never reached their earlier levels. At the beginning of the 21st century, variations of the hoop were sometimes used by adults for aerobic exercise, and the popular Nintendo Wii Fit game also contained a Hula Hoop activity.
