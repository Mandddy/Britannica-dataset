Arthur Rackham,  (born Sept. 19, 1867, London, Eng.—died Sept. 6, 1939, Limpsfield, Surrey) British artist best known for his illustrations for classic fiction and children’s literature.
Reared in London, Rackham enrolled in evening classes at the Lambeth School of Art in 1884 and spent seven years studying there while also working full-time in an insurance office. While a staff artist for a newspaper, the Westminster Budget (1892–96), he also began illustrating books. He became skillful using the new halftone process, and his drawings began to reveal a unique range of imagination. Rackham achieved renown with the publication of a 1900 edition of the Grimm brothers’ Fairy Tales featuring his illustrations. He illustrated a limited edition of Washington Irving’s Rip Van Winkle (1905), which made him known in America as well. In 1908 Rackham was made a full member of the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolours.
