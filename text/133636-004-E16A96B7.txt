James M. Wayne, in full James Moore Wayne   (born c. 1790, Savannah, Ga., U.S.—died  July 5, 1867, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1835–67).
Wayne was admitted to the bar in 1810 and started to practice in Savannah. After the War of 1812 he was elected to the legislature for his opposition to an act suspending the collection of debts; he then served as mayor of Savannah and as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas. In 1822 he was named judge of the Superior Court and in 1828 was elected to the U.S. Congress, in which he served three terms. He was a strong supporter of President Andrew Jackson’s administration in almost all its major measures and was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Jackson in 1835. Although a Southerner, he remained loyal to the Union and kept his seat during the Civil War. His most memorable opinions concerned admiralty law and questions regarding land acquired from foreign countries.
