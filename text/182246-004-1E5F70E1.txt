Autograph, any manuscript handwritten by its author, either in alphabetical or musical notation. (The term also refers to a person’s handwritten signature.) Aside from its antiquarian or associative value, an autograph may be an early or corrected draft of a manuscript and provide valuable evidence of the stages of composition or of the “correct” final version of a work.
No autographs of ancient Greek or Roman authors survive; manuscripts of their works are rarely older than the 6th century ad and more often belong to the 9th and 10th centuries. In the European Middle Ages, before the invention of printing, theological, historical, and literary works were copied in regular “book hands” by professional scribes who were monks. It is thus difficult to speak of medieval autographs, although some manuscripts of chronicles appear to have been actually written by their compilers. Probably the earliest known European lay signature is that of the Spanish captain the Cid, dated 1096. Official documents of the kings in early medieval times were normally validated by the affixing of a seal. Edward III (1327–77) is the first English king whose writing survives, though he was not the first literate English king.
