European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), major European aerospace company that builds commercial and military aircraft, space systems, propulsion systems, missiles, and other defense products. It was formed in 2000 from the merger of three leading European aerospace firms: Aerospatiale Matra of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany, and Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. (CASA) of Spain. Headquarters are in Paris, France, and Munich, Germany.
Measured by sales, EADS is the third largest aerospace company in the world (after Boeing and Lockheed Martin). It holds an 80 percent share in the consortium Airbus Industrie and is responsible for the final assembly of Airbus aircraft. EADS has a controlling interest in the joint venture Astrium (created 2000), the first trinational space company, whose facilities in France, Germany, and Great Britain cover a full spectrum of the space business from ground systems and launch vehicles to satellites and orbital infrastructure. Its Eurocopter subsidiary develops, builds, and markets a comprehensive range of military and civil helicopters. EADS also has stakes in Arianespace, which markets the commercial services of the Ariane family of launch vehicles; the Eurofighter consortium to develop a multirole combat aircraft; Avions de Transport Régionale (ATR), a leading maker of regional turboprop aircraft; and the French aerospace firm Dassault, which builds the Mirage and Rafale families of fighters as well as Falcon business jets. In 2001 EADS, BAE Systems, and Italy’s Finmeccanica group agreed to combine the missiles and missile-systems activities of their subsidiaries Matra BAe Dynamics, EADS Aerospatiale Matra Missiles, and Alenia Marconi Systems into a single pan-European corporate entity with the name MBDA. At the start of the 21st century the company employed some 100,000 people at more than 90 locations.
