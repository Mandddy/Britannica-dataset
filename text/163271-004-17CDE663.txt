Dick Clark, in full Richard Wagstaff Clark  (born November 30, 1929, Bronxville, New York, U.S.—died April 18, 2012, Santa Monica, California) American television personality and businessman, best known for hosting American Bandstand.
Clark was a disc jockey at the student-run radio station at Syracuse University (1951), and he worked at radio and television stations in Syracuse and Utica, New York, before moving in 1952 to WFIL radio in Philadelphia. In 1956 he took over as the host of Bandstand, a popular afternoon program on WFIL-TV on which teenagers danced to records. Largely through Clark’s initiative, Bandstand was picked up by ABC as American Bandstand for nationwide distribution, beginning on August 5, 1957. The program’s mix of lip-synched performances, interviews, and its famous “Rate-a-Record” segment captivated teenagers. Overnight, Clark became one of pop music’s most important tastemakers, as exposure on American Bandstand or his prime-time program, The Dick Clark Show, generated countless hits. Meanwhile, Clark’s business interests grew to include record companies, song publishing, and artist management. When the record industry’s payola scandal (involving payment in return for airplay) broke in 1959, Clark told a congressional committee that he was unaware that performers in whom he had a financial interest had received disproportionate play on his programs. He emerged from the investigation largely unscathed.
