Wilt Chamberlain, in full Wilton Norman Chamberlain, bynames Wilt the Stilt and the Big Dipper  (born August 21, 1936, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died October 12, 1999, Los Angeles, California) professional basketball player, considered to be one of the greatest offensive players in the history of the game. More than 7 feet (2.1 metres) tall, Chamberlain was an outstanding centre. During his 1961–62 season he became the first player to score more than 4,000 points in a National Basketball Association (NBA) season, with 4,029, averaging 50.4 points per game.
As a teenager, Chamberlain was sought after by more than 100 colleges and universities after his play at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia. He played two years (1956–58) at the University of Kansas, after which he joined the Harlem Globetrotters for a year (1958–59). He went to the NBA in 1959, playing with the Philadelphia Warriors (1959–65; the team moved and became the  in 1962), going back to Philadelphia to play for the 76ers (1965–68), and finishing his career with the Los Angeles Lakers (1968–73). Chamberlain had a long-standing (but good-natured) rivalry with Boston Celtic Bill Russell, and many credit the increase in the popularity of professional basketball to the excitement generated around games featuring these two players.
