Brittle star, also called serpent star,  any of the 2,100 living species of marine invertebrates constituting the subclass Ophiuroidea (phylum Echinodermata). Their long, thin arms—usually five and often forked and spiny—are distinctly set off from the small disk-shaped body. The arms readily break off but soon regrow—i.e., are regenerated. Among the basket stars, a type of brittle star, each arm may branch multiple times, and the outstretched arms reach nearly 1 metre (about 3 feet) across. Most basket stars live in deep water.
The mouth, on the underside of the body, has five teeth; an anus is lacking; and the tube feet serve mainly as sense organs for detecting light and odour. The animal feeds by extending one or more arms into the water or over the mud, the other arms serving as anchors. Brittle stars are mainly deposit feeders, scavengers, and plankton feeders; however, they sometimes trap sizable animals. They are capable of moving jerkily but usually cling to the seafloor or to sponges or cnidarians (e.g., coral).
