Charles Warren Fairbanks,  (born May 11, 1852, Union County, Ohio, U.S.—died  June 4, 1918, Indianapolis, Ind.) 26th vice president of the United States (1905–09) in the Republican administration of President Theodore Roosevelt. He was sometimes referred to as “the last of America’s log-cabin statesmen.”
Fairbanks was the son of Loriston Monroe Fairbanks, a farmer, and Mary Adelaide Smith, who was a strong supporter of abolitionism. Growing up in poverty in a one-room cabin, Fairbanks rose to prominence as an Indiana railway attorney and was the chief power in the state Republican Party from 1896 until his death. In the United States Senate (1897–1905), he was quietly effective and quickly became acknowledged as the principal spokesman for that body.
