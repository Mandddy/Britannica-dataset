Henry Bataille, in full Félix-Henry Bataille  (born April 4, 1872, Nîmes, France—died  March 2, 1922, Rueil-Malmaison) French dramatist whose luxuriant plays of passionate love and stifling social conventions were extremely popular at the beginning of the 20th century.
Bataille’s parents died when he was very young, and, having shown talent for both painting and poetry at school, he turned to writing by the age of 14. After several false starts his successful career began with L’Enchantement (1900), followed by such works as Maman Colibri (1904); La Femme nue (1908; “The Nude Woman”), considered by many his best play; and La Vierge folle (1910; “The Foolish Virgin”). The combination of sonorous, exaggerated language and explicit social messages soon dated his plays. Even though his art evolved toward the theatre of ideas and, later, toward social drama, as in La Chair humaine (1922; “Human Flesh”), his later works were less successful. His theory of “indirect language,” capable of betraying or concealing a character’s subconscious desires, although largely unapplied in his own work, makes him a forerunner of Jean-Jacques Bernard and the “school of silence.”
