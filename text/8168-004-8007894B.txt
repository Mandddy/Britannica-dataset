English toy spaniel, breed of dog known in Britain since Tudor times but that apparently originated in ancient Japan or China. It was favoured by Mary, Queen of Scots, King Charles II (after whom it was named the King Charles spaniel), and Queen Victoria, as well as by members of the aristocracy. It is said that Charles II was rarely without his dogs, and he had an edict passed that such spaniels could not be refused entry to any public place in Britain. A compact little dog with a domed head, short nose, and large, dark eyes, it has long, heavily haired, hanging ears and a long, soft, wavy coat. It stands 9 to 10 inches (23 to 25.5 cm) and weighs about 9 to 12 pounds (4 to 5.5 kg). There are four varieties, all similar except in colour. The King Charles variety is black-and-tan, as in the original members of the breed; the Prince Charles is black, tan, and white; the Blenheim is red and white; the Ruby is solid mahogany red. In Britain all varieties except the Blenheim are grouped as King Charles spaniels.
The Cavalier King Charles spaniel is a different breed, recognized in Britain and the United States. It appears in the same coat colours as the English toy spaniels, but it is larger (13 to 18 pounds [6 to 8 kg]) and has a longer muzzle. By the early 20th century, the English toy spaniel had been bred to a type less and less like the dogs shown in old paintings (as, for instance, in Edwin Landseer’s painting The Cavalier’s Pets [exhibited 1845]). In 1926 American Roswell Eldridge began offering prizes at the Crufts dog show to the dog most like an old Cavalier spaniel. Eventually, breeders became interested in the type, and by 1945 the Kennel Club of England had recognized the Cavalier King Charles spaniel as a distinct breed for which championships could be awarded.
