Anne Hutchinson, née Anne Marbury  (baptized July 20, 1591, Alford, Lincolnshire, England—died August or September 1643, Pelham Bay, New York [U.S.]) religious liberal who became one of the founders of Rhode Island after her banishment from Massachusetts Bay Colony.
Anne Marbury was the daughter of a silenced clergyman and grew up in an atmosphere of learning. She married William Hutchinson, a merchant, in 1612, and in 1634 they migrated to Massachusetts Bay Colony. Anne Hutchinson soon organized weekly meetings of Boston women to discuss recent sermons and to give expression to her own theological views. Before long her sessions attracted ministers and magistrates as well. She stressed the individual’s intuition as a means of reaching God and salvation, rather than the observance of institutionalized beliefs and the precepts of ministers. Her opponents accused her of antinomianism—the view that God’s grace has freed the Christian from the need to observe established moral precepts.
