Tuileries Palace, French Palais des Tuileries,  French royal residence adjacent to the Louvre in Paris before it was destroyed by arson in 1871. Construction of the original palace—commissioned by Catherine de Médicis—was begun in 1564, and in the subsequent 200 years there were many additions and alterations. Among the French architects who worked on the building in the 16th century were Philibert Delorme, who designed the first plans, Jean Bullant, and Jacques du Cerceau. Louis Le Vau, in the 17th century, also contributed to the structure. In the gardens that survive, an arch from Delorme’s loggia was rebuilt; it is an example of his French Ionic order.
