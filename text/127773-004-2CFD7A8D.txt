Anthony C. McAuliffe,  (born July 2, 1898, Washington, D.C.—died  Aug. 11, 1975, Washington) U.S. Army general who commanded the force defending Bastogne, Belgium, in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944) during World War II.
Graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. (1919), McAuliffe was commissioned in the field artillery and held routine service and school appointments in peacetime. At the time of the Normandy invasion (June 1944), he was artillery commander of the 101st Airborne Division. He was in command of the entire division when the Germans counterattacked in the Ardennes; his stout defense of Bastogne checked the German drive and contributed directly to the final defeat of the Germans. His terse reply to a Nazi ultimatum to surrender at Bastogne was “Nuts!”
