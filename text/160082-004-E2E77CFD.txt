George Jones, in full George Glenn Jones   (born September 12, 1931, Saratoga, Texas, U.S.—died April 26, 2013, Nashville, Tennessee) American honky-tonk performer and balladeer considered to be one of the greatest country singers of all time.
Jones’s early work was influenced by Roy Acuff and Hank Williams (both renowned for their genuine, often mournful songs) and the Texas honky-tonk vocal tradition. In 1953 Jones signed with Harold W. (“Pappy”) Daily’s new Starday label in Beaumont, Texas. With Daily as his producer, Jones had a remarkable run of Top Ten hits, such as “The Race Is On” (1964), on the country music charts over the next 15 years. The first to reach number one was “White Lightning” (1959), a raucous novelty song written by his friend the rock-and-roll deejay, songwriter, and recording artist known as the Big Bopper. Other chart-toppers were “Tender Years” (1961) and “She Thinks I Still Care” (1962).
