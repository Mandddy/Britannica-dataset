Pest, any organism judged as a threat to human beings or to their interests. When early man hunted animals and foraged for food, he shared the natural resources with other organisms in the community. As human culture developed and population rose, people made ever-increasing demands on these resources. One result of changing the environment has been a great increase in the number of species that are now recognized as competitors of humans. These competitors are usually referred to as pests. The definition of pest is, of course, subjective. An ecologist would not necessarily consider several leaf-eating caterpillars on a plant as pests, whereas a gardener who cultivated the plant might very well do so. And only one bat, rat, or mouse is enough to qualify as a household pest.
Natural communities have always contained organisms that were economically significant; locusts, for example, have plagued humans throughout history, and grain from Stone Age locations has been found infected with bunt and ergot diseases. Most species that became pests, however, did so because of environmental modification, occasionally from natural causes but usually from human activities.
