Wilhelmina, in full Wilhelmina Helena Pauline Maria   (born Aug. 31, 1880, The Hague, Neth.—died Nov. 28, 1962, Het Loo, near Apeldoorn) queen of the Netherlands from 1890 to 1948, who, through her radio broadcasts from London during World War II, made herself the symbol of Dutch resistance to German occupation.
The daughter of King William III and his second wife, Emma of Waldeck-Pyrmont, Wilhelmina became queen on her father’s death (Nov. 23, 1890) under her mother’s regency. She was inaugurated Sept. 6, 1898, at Amsterdam’s Nieuwe Kerk, and soon gained widespread popular approval. On Feb. 7, 1901, she married Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and gave birth to a daughter, Princess Juliana, on April 30, 1909. During World War I, Wilhelmina was influential in maintaining the Netherlands’ neutrality.
