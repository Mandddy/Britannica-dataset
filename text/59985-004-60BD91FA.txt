François Boucher,  (born Sept. 29, 1703, Paris, France—died May 30, 1770, Paris) painter, engraver, and designer whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period.
Trained by his father, a lace designer, Boucher won the Prix de Rome in 1723. He was influenced by the works of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Peter Paul Rubens, and his teacher François Le Moyne. Boucher’s first major commission was for engravings of 125 drawings by Antoine Watteau. After illustrating an edition of Molière’s works, he drew cartoons of farmyard scenes and chinoiserie for the Beauvais tapestry factory.
