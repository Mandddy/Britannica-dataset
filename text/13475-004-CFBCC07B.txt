Anaximander,  (born 610 bce, Miletus [now in Turkey]—died  546 bce) Greek philosopher who was the first to develop a cosmology, or systematic philosophical view of the world.
Only a short fragment of Anaximander’s work survives, so reconstructions of his philosophy and astronomy must be based on summaries by later Greek writers, such as the 1st- or 2nd-century ce compiler of philosophical opinions Aëtius, the 3rd-century theologian and antipope Hippolytus, and the 6th-century Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius. Anaximander is said to have been a pupil or associate of the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus and to have written about astronomy, geography, and the nature of things. Anaximander set up a gnomon (a shadow-casting rod) at Sparta and used it to demonstrate the equinoxes and solstices and perhaps the hours of the day. He drew a map of the known world, which was later corrected by his fellow Milesian, the author Hecataeus, a well-traveled man. He may also have built a celestial globe.
