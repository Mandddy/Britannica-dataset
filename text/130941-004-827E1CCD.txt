Gary Hart, in full Gary Warren Hartpence  (born November 28, 1936, Ottawa, Kansas, U.S.) American politician who served as a U.S. senator from Colorado (1975–87). He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and again in 1988; he suspended the latter campaign soon after the Miami Herald newspaper reported that he was having an extramarital affair.
Hart earned degrees at Bethany (Oklahoma) Nazarene College and Yale Divinity School with the intention of going into the ministry. Sen. John F. Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign, however, inspired him to change his goals from preaching and teaching to law and politics; four years later he graduated from Yale Law School. Hart first made a name for himself as the campaign manager for Sen. George McGovern’s run for the presidency in 1972. His organizational and fund-raising strategies enabled the liberal McGovern to capture the Democratic nomination. Two years after his candidate lost the general election to Richard Nixon, Hart was elected by Colorado voters to the U.S. Senate. By the time he won reelection in 1980, he was considerably more conservative than the long-haired Hart of the McGovern days.
