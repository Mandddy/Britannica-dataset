Toad bug (family Gelastocoridae), any of some 100 species of insects in the true bug order, Heteroptera, that resemble tiny frogs. They have short, broad bodies and protruding eyes and capture their prey by leaping upon it. Adults in this family are wingless.
Toad bugs are found in all zoogeographic regions living along the muddy edges of streams and ponds. Some species spend part of their lives in underground holes that they make. Their eggs have been found buried in sand. The colour of toad bugs varies, depending on the environment in which they live.
