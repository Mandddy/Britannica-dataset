Horatio Gates,  (born c. 1728, Maldon, Essex, England—died  April 10, 1806, New York, New York, U.S.) English-born American general in the American Revolution (1775–83) whose victory over the British at the Battle of Saratoga (1777) turned the tide of victory in behalf of the Revolutionaries.
Gates first served in North America in the French and Indian War (1754–63), emerged as a major, and returned to England. In 1772 he immigrated to the region that is now West Virginia. Sympathizing with colonial complaints against the crown, in 1775 he was made adjutant general of the Continental Army, and in 1777 he superseded General Philip Schuyler in northern New York. In the two battles of Saratoga his army forced General John Burgoyne to surrender, partly, however, because of the previous maneuvers of Schuyler and the initiative of General Benedict Arnold. Congress next elected Gates president of the Board of War. At the same time a group of army officers, among them General Thomas Conway, became involved in a plan to replace General George Washington with Gates. The “Conway Cabal” soon collapsed, and in the spring of 1778 Gates returned to his command in New York. Transferred to the south (June 1780), Gates was disastrously defeated by Lord Cornwallis at the Battle of Camden, South Carolina, on August 16. An official inquiry into his conduct was ordered but charges were never pressed. After the war Gates freed his slaves, moved to New York, and served one term in the state legislature.
