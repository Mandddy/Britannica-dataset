Alexander IV, original name Rinaldo Conti, count of Segni  (born 1199, Anagni, near Rome [Italy]—died May 25, 1261, Viterbo, Papal States) pope from 1254 to 1261.
Alexander was appointed cardinal deacon (1227) and cardinal bishop of Ostia (1231) by his uncle Pope Gregory IX. After becoming pope, Alexander followed the policies of his predecessor Innocent IV: he continued war on Manfred, Emperor Frederick II’s natural son (who was crowned king of Sicily in 1258), by excommunicating him and investing Edmund, son of Henry III of England, with the papal fief of Sicily. He supported the new mendicant orders, especially the Franciscans, upholding the friars at Paris against the secular professors. He extended the Inquisition in France, worked for reunion between eastern Christians and Rome, and attempted in vain to organize a Crusade against the Tatars.
