Chhattisgarh is located in the Chhattisgarh Plain, which forms the upper Mahanadi River basin. The basin proper lies at an elevation that ranges from about 800 to 950 feet (250 to 300 metres) above sea level. It is a structural plain with topographic variations resulting from extensive denudation (wearing away of the earth by such processes as weathering and erosion). Knolls, undulating interfluves (areas between adjacent watercourses), and valleys flanked by belts of clayey soils are characteristic of the region. About 100 miles (160 km) wide, the Chhattisgarh Plain is bounded by the Chota Nagpur plateau to the north, the Maikala Range to the west, the hills of Raigarh to the northeast, the Raipur upland to the southeast, and the Bastar plateau to the south. These highlands comprise mostly erosional plateau forms reaching an elevation of more than 2,300 feet (700 metres) in the Maikala Range and the Dandakaranya hills.
