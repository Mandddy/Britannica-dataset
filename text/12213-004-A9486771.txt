Louis-Marie-Olivier Duchesne,  (born Sept. 13, 1843, Saint-Servan, Fr.—died  April 21, 1922, Rome) church historian, a leading figure in the 19th- and early 20th-century Roman Catholic revival of learning, who pioneered in the application of archaeological, topographical, liturgical, theological, and social studies to church history.
Ordained a priest in 1867, he studied in Rome and in Paris (1871–73), where he was appointed professor at the Catholic Institute (1877–85) and where in 1881 he founded the Bulletin Critique de Littérature, d’Histoire et de Théologie. Persuaded to resign after criticism of his lectures, he taught at the École Supérieure des Lettres from 1885 to 1895, when he was appointed director of the École Française de Rome; he served there until his death. In 1910 he was elected to the French Academy and was made a prothonotary apostolic by Pope Leo XIII.
