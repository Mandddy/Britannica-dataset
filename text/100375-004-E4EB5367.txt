Spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), also called Andean bear,  bear, the only South American species of the family Ursidae. It inhabits mountainous regions (particularly of the Andes), dwelling primarily in forested areas, and it feeds mainly on shoots and fruit.
The spectacled bear is an agile climber. The adult stands to 64 cm (about 25 inches) at the shoulder and varies from 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 feet) in length, with a 7-centimetre (3-inch) tail. Its shaggy coat varies from dark brown to black. Characteristic whitish to yellowish marks usually encircle the eyes partially or completely to form “spectacles,” often extending down the neck and to the chest. Litters of one to three cubs have been born in captivity after a gestation period of 8–8 1/2 months.
