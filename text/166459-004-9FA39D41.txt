United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, museum and memorial to the Holocaust, located in Washington, D.C., U.S. It was dedicated in 1993 to serve as the national Holocaust museum.
The museum’s permanent exhibit, titled “The Holocaust,” is divided into three parts—“Nazi Assault,” “Final Solution,” and “Last Chapter.” Upon entrance, visitors are issued an identity card with the name of a real person who was persecuted by Nazis or their collaborators. They are guided on a path through the three-level exhibit, which contains photographs, artifacts, and audio and video footage, as well as large-scale installations, including a Polish railcar that was used to transport Jews to concentration camps and that visitors are allowed to board. Throughout the exhibit, visitors are given a chance to learn about the fate of the individual on their assigned identity card. In the Hall of Remembrance—a hexagonal room that echoes the six-pointed Star of David and the six million Jews who died—located at the end of the permanent exhibit, visitors may pray, meditate, and light candles in remembrance of the victims.
