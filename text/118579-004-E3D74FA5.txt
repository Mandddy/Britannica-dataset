San Lorenzo,  early Renaissance-style church designed by Brunelleschi and constructed in Florence from 1421 to the 1460s, except for the facade, which was left uncompleted. Also by Brunelleschi is the Old Sacristy (finished in 1428).
The New Sacristy, more commonly called the Medici Chapel, is largely the work of Michelangelo, as are the celebrated Medici Tombs it houses. Michelangelo also designed the Laurentian Library, which is located off the cloister. The tombs of the grand dukes of Tuscany line the walls of the Baroque Chapel of the Princes, which was begun in 1604 according to plans of Ferdinand I deâ€™ Medici.
