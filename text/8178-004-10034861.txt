Schipperke, Belgian dog breed that originated in Flanders several centuries ago and was used for many years as a guard on barges. The schipperke (“little captain”) is descended from a black shepherd dog, the Leauvenaar, which also gave rise to the Belgian sheepdog. A short, thickset, tailless dog with a dense, black coat and a foxlike head, the schipperke stands 10 to 13 inches (25 to 33 cm) and weighs up to 18 pounds (8 kg). It has a characteristic lively and inquisitive expression and is generally hardy and energetic; it is an able vermin hunter and a good watchdog.
