Cork, Irish Corcaigh (“Marsh”),  seaport and seat of County Cork, in the province of Munster, Ireland. It is located at the head of Cork Harbour on the River Lee. Cork is, after Dublin, the Irish republic’s second largest conurbation. The city is administratively independent of the county.
The centre of the old city is an island in the Lee, and the original site was probably near St. Fin Barre’s Cathedral, whose 7th-century monastery attracted many students and votaries (no traces of the earliest constructions remain). Cork was raided and burned in 821, 846, and 1012 by Norsemen who eventually settled there and founded a trading centre on the banks of the Lee. The then-walled town passed into Anglo-Norman hands in 1172, became a royal borough in 1177, and was granted its first city charter by Prince (later King) John in 1185. The city supported Perkin Warbeck, the pretender to the English throne, when he visited Ireland in 1491–92. The city revolted against Charles I in favour of Oliver Cromwell in 1649. In 1690 Cork was taken by John Churchill, earl of Marlborough, for William of Orange (William III).
