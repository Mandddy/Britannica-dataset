Kura River, Turkish Kuruçay, Georgian Mtkvari,  river in Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The Kura is the largest river in Transcaucasia. It rises on the slopes of Mount Kısırındağı in extreme eastern Turkey and cuts northward through the Lesser Caucasus range in a series of gorges with many rapids. Some distance after entering Georgia, the river swings eastward across the Kartli plain and takes a southeasterly course for the remainder of its length. Just above the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, a dam has been built along the Mtskheta narrows, and the river valley subsequently broadens out into an extensive lowland. Farther downstream, the narrows near Mingäçevir in Azerbaijan are the site of another dam and hydroelectric station that have created a large reservoir called Lake Mingäçevir. There is much flooding along the Kura’s lower course. The river finally enters the Caspian Sea by a delta.
The Kura is 848 miles (1,364 km) long and drains an area of 72,500 square miles (188,000 sq km). Several of its tributaries also provide hydroelectric power, and the Kura itself is extensively used for irrigation purposes. The river is navigable upstream for 300 miles (480 km) as far as Yevlax, just south of Mingäçevir.
