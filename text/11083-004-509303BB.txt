José Maria de Heredia,  (born Nov. 22, 1842, La Fortuna, Cuba—died  Oct. 2, 1905, near Houdan, Fr.) Cuban-born French poet, brilliant master of the sonnet.
The son of a wealthy Spanish coffee plantation owner and a French mother, Heredia was educated at Senlis, near Paris. He claimed France as “the country of my mind and heart”; and, although he went home after finishing his schooling, he quickly returned to Paris and studied at the School of Paleography. He became the close friend of the poet Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle and, like him, was a leading figure in the Parnassians.
