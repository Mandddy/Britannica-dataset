Isadore Manuel Singer,  (born May 3, 1924, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.) American mathematician awarded, together with the British mathematician Sir Michael Francis Atiyah, the 2004 Abel Prize by the Norwegian Academy of Sciences and Letters for “their discovery and proof of the index theorem, bringing together topology, geometry and analysis, and their outstanding role in building new bridges between mathematics and theoretical physics.”
After graduating with a degree in mathematics from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1944, Singer had his further education interrupted by a three-year stint in the U.S. Army. Following his discharge, he attended the University of Chicago, where he earned a master’s degree (1948) and a doctorate (1950), both in mathematics.
