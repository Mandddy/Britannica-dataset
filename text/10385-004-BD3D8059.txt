August von Kotzebue,  (born May 3, 1761, Weimar, Saxony [Germany]—died March 23, 1819, Mannheim, Baden) German playwright widely influential in popularizing poetic drama, into which he instilled melodramatic sensationalism and sentimental philosophizing.
Kotzebue’s first comedy, written while he was a law student at Jena, gave him entrée into court literary circles in Weimar, but in 1781 he was forced to go into exile for a reason that is not clear. Entering government service in Russia (1783), he became president of the magistracy of the province of Estonia in 1785 and was ennobled. Some of his greatest successes—Adelheid von Wulfingen (1788), Menschenhass und Reue (1789–90; The Stranger), Die Indianer in England (1790; The Indian Exiles)—were written while he lived there. His Spanier in Peru (1796) was adapted by the English playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan as Pizarro (1799) and also proved a great success. Kotzebue traveled abroad and spent some time writing for the municipal theatre of Vienna. Upon his return to Russia he was arrested, inexplicably, and exiled to Siberia. The emperor Paul I, just as capriciously as he had exiled Kotzebue, had him released a few months later. Kotzebue was given an estate in Livonia and made director of the German theatre in St. Petersburg.
