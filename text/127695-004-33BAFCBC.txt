Oregon Caves National Monument, cave complex in the Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon, U.S., near the California border. Established in 1909, the monument occupies a surface area of 0.8 square mile (2 square km). It consists of a single cave comprising a series of chambers joined by subterranean corridors on four levels.
The cave was formed as groundwater dissolved the surrounding marble. It comprises some 3.5 miles (5.6 km) of passages and contains many beautiful stalagmites, stalactites, flowstones, cave popcorn, and other fantastic formations. The half-mile cave tour includes more than 500 stairs. On the surface above are old-growth forests of Douglas fir and cedar at higher elevations and oak, pine, and madrone forests at lower elevations; notable among the varied wildlife species are flying squirrels and the Pacific giant salamander.
