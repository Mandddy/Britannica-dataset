Poster, printed paper announcement or advertisement that is exhibited publicly. Whether promoting a product, an event, or a sentiment (such as patriotism), a poster must immediately catch the attention of the passerby. There is no set way to accomplish this; success can stem, for example, from the instantaneous impact of a concise, striking design or from the sumptuous appeal of an ornate work of art. By extension, the term poster is used to denote a paper panel printed for display as a novelty or as a work of art.
Although printed public advertisements can be traced to the 15th century, the poster as it is understood today did not emerge until around 1860, given impetus by the invention of lithography, which allowed brilliantly coloured posters to be produced cheaply and easily. The first of the great modern poster artists, Jules Chéret, began his career in 1867 with a theatrical poster announcing a performance by Sarah Bernhardt. His captivating depictions of the entertainers of Parisian night life, rendered in clear, radiant colours, dominated Paris displays for the last 30 years of the 19th century and also attracted others to the medium. The result was extraordinary diversity of style, from the folk art imagery of anonymous lithographers to major works by the best known of the poster artists, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Lautrec’s posters of the 1890s, characterized by bold, dramatic designs, are lively and sensitive depictions of Parisian personalities.
