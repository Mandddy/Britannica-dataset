Pratincole, also called Swallow Plover,  any of six or seven Old World shorebird species constituting the subfamily Glareolinae of the family Glareolidae, which also includes the coursers. Pratincoles are about 20 cm (8 inches) long and are brown with a white rump; the tail is forked, and the wings are long and pointed. Pratincoles feed on insects at twilight, flying over rivers and lakes in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. They nest colonially, on the ground, often in hoofprints of grazing animals.
The common pratincole (Glareola pratincola) has reddish brown underwings and a yellowish throat outlined in black. The black-winged pratincole (G. nordmanni) of the Middle East is called locust bird in Africa, where it winters. Smaller species with less-forked tails and shorter wings are sometimes separated as the genus Galachrysia; these include the white-collared pratincole (G. nuchalis) of Africa and the little Indian pratincole (G. lactea) of southern Asia. The Australian pratincole (Stiltia isabella) is a longer-legged bird, and, unlike other pratincoles, it frequents dry plains in the arid interior of the country.
