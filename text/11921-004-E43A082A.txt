Konstantin Aleksandrovich Fedin,  (born Feb. 24 [Feb. 12, Old Style], 1892, Saratov, Russia—died  July 15, 1977, Moscow) Soviet writer noted primarily for his early novels that portray the difficulties of intellectuals in Soviet Russia.
During the 1920s, Fedin belonged to a literary group called the Serapion Brothers, the members of which accepted the Revolution but demanded freedom for art and literature. His first novel, Goroda i gody (1924; “Cities and Years”), based partly on his experiences as an internee in Germany during World War I, was a social-psychological study of the reaction of the intelligentsia to the Russian Revolution. Gradually, however, he took a position more consistent with official Soviet literary policies and, in 1959, was appointed first secretary of the steering committee of the Union of Soviet Writers, a post he held until 1971, when he was elected chairman of the executive board.
