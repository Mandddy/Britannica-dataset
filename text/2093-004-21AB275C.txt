Edmonia Lewis, in full Mary Edmonia Lewis  (born c. July 4, 1844, Greenbush, N.Y., U.S.â€”died Sept. 17, 1907, London, Eng.) American sculptor whose Neoclassical works exploring religious and classical themes won contemporary praise and received renewed interest in the late 20th century.
Lewis was the daughter of an African American man and a woman of African and Ojibwa (Chippewa) descent. She was orphaned at a young age and afterward reportedly lived with her maternal aunts among the Ojibwa, who called her Wildfire. With the help of an older brother, she obtained admission to the preparatory department of Oberlin College in 1859, and from 1860 to 1863 she attended the college proper.
