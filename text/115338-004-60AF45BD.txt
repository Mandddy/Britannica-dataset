Petter Dass,  (born 1647, Nord Herøy, near Alstahaug, Norway—died 1707, Alstahaug) Norwegian poet who, in an age of pedantry and artifice, stands out among his contemporaries for the vivid freshness, everyday language, and common appeal of his works. He is the first writer in Dano-Norwegian literature to strike a genuinely Norwegian note.
The son of a Scottish merchant who had settled in Nordland (the three northernmost provinces of Norway), Dass studied at Copenhagen, was ordained in 1677, and became pastor of Alstahaug in northern Norway in 1689. He remained there the rest of his life, exhorting and comforting his scattered parish of fishermen, shepherds, and farmers. His poems were circulated in manuscript and learned by heart by his parishioners. Only the poem Den nordske dale-viise (1683; “The Norwegian Song of the Valley”) was published during his lifetime. Many of his easily memorized sacred poems (or songs) were collected after his death as Bibelski viise-bog (1711; “Biblical Songbook”). But he is best known for Nordlands trompet (written 1678–1700; published 1739; The Trumpet of Nordland), a rhyming description of Nordland that depicts, with loving accuracy and homely humour, its natural features, people, and occupations. Written in an easy, swinging metre, it is addressed to the common people.
