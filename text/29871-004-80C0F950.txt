James Fitzjames, duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed,  (born August 21, 1670, Moulins, France—died  June 12, 1734, Philippsburg, Württemberg [Germany]) English nobleman and marshal of France who was a leading military commander in the French service in the earlier wars of the 18th century.
Fitzjames was the “illegitimate” son of James, duke of York (later King James II of England), and Arabella Churchill, the sister of John Churchill, later 1st duke of Marlborough. Educated in France, he was created duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed (usually abbreviated to duke of Berwick) by James II in 1687 and appointed governor of Portsmouth the following year, but he fled to France when James was deposed. Berwick nominally commanded an army of his father’s supporters against Marlborough in Ireland and was present at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. In 1693 he accepted a commission as lieutenant general in the French army.
