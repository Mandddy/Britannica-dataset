Viceroyalty of New Spain, Spanish Virreinato de Nueva España,  the first of the four viceroyalties that Spain created to govern its conquered lands in the New World. Established in 1535, it initially included all land north of the Isthmus of Panama under Spanish control. This later came to include upper and lower California, the area that is now the central and southwestern portion of the United States, and territory eastward along the Gulf of Mexico to Florida. The Viceroyalty of New Spain was also charged with governing Spain’s Caribbean possessions. Later, in 1565, the newly conquered Philippines were placed under the jurisdiction of New Spain.
Although technically superior in governing authority, the viceroy in New Spain was hampered in practice from exerting that authority by the considerable independence of governors and royal audiencias in many of the subordinate areas. His power was largely confined to central and southern Mexico—from San Luis Potosí in the north to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south. Within this territory, the viceroys of New Spain aided in converting the native population to Christianity, developed an array of educational institutions, and oversaw an economy based almost entirely on mining and ranching. During the first 100 years of Spanish rule, the Indian population of New Spain declined from an estimated 25 million to 1 million as a result of maltreatment, disease, and disruption of their cultures.
