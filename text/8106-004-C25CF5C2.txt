Brittany, formerly Brittany spaniel,  breed of sporting dog that points and retrieves game; although it was formerly called the Brittany spaniel, it resembles a small setter. Of medium size but with relatively long legs, it stands from 17.5 to 20.5 inches (44.5 to 52 cm) and weighs 30 to 40 pounds (13.5 to 18 kg). Most are naturally tailless or short-tailed, and longer tails are docked to about 4 inches (10 cm). Its coat is flat, with a small amount of feathering on the ears, underside, and legs. Canadian and American Kennel Club standards accept only the orange and white or liver and white coloration, but European Brittanies may also be black and white or tricolour. The Brittany is considered an ideal gun dog, easily trained and an active worker.
