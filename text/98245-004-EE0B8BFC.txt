Stock-car racing, form of automobile racing, popular in the United States, in which cars that conform externally to standard U.S. commercial types are raced, usually on oval, paved tracks. Stock-car racing is said to have originated during the U.S. Prohibition period (1919â€“33), when illegal still operators, needing private cars capable of more than ordinary speed to evade the law while transporting liquor, tuned and altered ordinary passenger automobiles to make them faster. Subsequently, these cars were raced for pleasure, particularly in the southeastern states, where the sport remained most popular.
Organized stock-car racing began at Langhorne, Pennsylvania, in 1939. The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), founded in 1947 at Daytona Beach, Florida, gave the sport its first formal organization. The sport had become popular on the beach at Daytona Beach from the 1930s, but the first organized racing in Daytona took place in 1948. By the 1970s several other organizations, including the United States Auto Club (USAC), also sponsored stock-car races. Automotive companies often sponsor racing teams in order to test performance and safety equipment.
