United Church of Christ, Protestant denomination in the United States, formed by the union of the Evangelical and Reformed Church and the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches. Each was itself the result of a former union. Negotiations toward union of the two bodies were begun in 1942, and during the next 15 years there were seven revisions of the Basis of Union. The United Church of Christ was formed in a General Synod on June 25, 1957, and its constitution was declared in force on July 4, 1961.
A Statement of Faith for the new church was adopted by the two uniting groups in 1959 in Oberlin, Ohio. This statement is, however, considered by members to be a testimony to the faith of the uniting churches rather than a final rule of faith. The local churches are neither bound by nor required to accept it.
