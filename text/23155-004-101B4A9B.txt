The Flying Burrito Brothers, American popular musical group of the late 1960s and ’70s that was one of the chief influences on the development of country rock. The original members were Chris Hillman (b. December 4, 1942, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), “Sneaky” Pete Kleinow (b. August 20, 1934, South Bend, Indiana, U.S.—d. January 6, 2007, Petaluma, California), Gram Parsons (original name Ingram Cecil Connor III; b. November 5, 1946, Winter Haven, Florida, U.S.—d. September 19, 1973, Yucca Valley, California), and Chris Ethridge (b. 1947, Meridian, Mississippi, U.S.—d. April 23, 2012, Meridian). Later members included Michael Clarke (b. June 3, 1944, New York City, New York, U.S.—d. December 19, 1993, Treasure Island, Florida), Bernie Leadon (b. July 19, 1947, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.), and Rick Roberts (b. August 31, 1949, Clearwater, Florida).
Parsons and Hillman, former members of the Byrds, founded the Flying Burrito Brothers in Los Angeles in 1968, appropriating the name from a group of local musicians who gathered for jam sessions. Earlier that year, Parsons had been the driving force behind the Byrds’ pioneering country rock album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The Burritos’ first album, The Gilded Palace of Sin (1969), also displayed Parsons’s guiding hand: he contributed most of the songs and shaped its combination of classic country and western—punctuated by Kleinow’s pedal-steel guitar—and hard-driving southern California rock. Even after Parsons left the Burritos in 1970 (replaced by Roberts), his songs continued to appear on the group’s albums, including the live Last of the Red Hot Burritos (1972), which also prominently featured bluegrass musicians. Numerous other personnel changes—including the arrival and departure of Leadon, who helped found the Eagles—and the group’s limited commercial appeal outside a small, devoted following contributed to its dissolution by 1973. Kleinow and Ethridge re-formed the band in 1975, and there were other short-lived incarnations into the 1990s.
