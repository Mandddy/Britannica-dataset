Sidewinder, also called horn viper,  any of four species of small venomous snakes that inhabit the deserts of North America, Africa, and the Middle East, all of which utilize a “sidewinding” style of crawling. The sidewinder (Crotalus cerastes) is a rattlesnake. This pit viper (subfamily Crotalinae) has small horns above each eye, possibly to keep sand from covering the eyes when the snake is buried. It is a nocturnal inhabitant of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico (see Sonoran Desert), where it feeds upon rodents. Adults average slightly more than 50 cm (20 inches) but can attain 80 cm. Sidewinders give birth to 5–18 young in the fall. Some individuals have lived nearly 20 years in captivity.
The three species of Old World sidewinders are pitless vipers (subfamily Viperinae) of the genus Cerastes. Two of them (C. cerastes and C. vipera) live in the Sahara. The third (C. gasperetti) is found in the Middle East and Arabia. All are short (50 cm) and stout with broad heads; some individuals have a hornlike scale over each eye. Their coloration is light, resembling the desert sands of their environment—shades of tan, pink, orange, or gray—with darker spots on the back. During the day they hide beneath the sand or rocks; at night they emerge to hunt for rodents, birds, and lizards. Instead of giving birth to live young, these sidewinders lay from 8 to 23 eggs. In captivity C. cerastes has lived up to 17 years.
