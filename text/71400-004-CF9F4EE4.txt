Philip Freneau, in full Philip Morin Freneau   (born Jan. 2, 1752, New York, N.Y. [U.S.]—died  Dec. 18, 1832, Monmouth county, N.J., U.S.) American poet, essayist, and editor, known as the “poet of the American Revolution.”
After graduating from Princeton University in 1771, Freneau taught school and studied for the ministry until the outbreak of the American Revolution, when he began to write vitriolic satire against the British and Tories. Not until his return from two years in the Caribbean islands, where he produced two of his most ambitious poems, “The Beauties of Santa Cruz” and “The House of Night,” did he become an active participant in the war, joining the New Jersey militia in 1778 and sailing through the British blockade as a privateer to the West Indies. Captured and imprisoned by the British in 1780, Freneau wrote in verse bitterly, on his release, The British Prison-Ship (1781).
