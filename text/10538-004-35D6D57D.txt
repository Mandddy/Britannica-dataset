John Kay,  (born July 16, 1704, near Bury, Lancashire, England—died c. 1780, France) English machinist and engineer, inventor of the flying shuttle, which was an important step toward automatic weaving.
The son of a woolen manufacturer, Kay was placed in charge of his father’s mill while still a youth. He made many improvements in dressing, batting, and carding machinery. On May 26, 1733, he received a patent for a “New Engine or Machine for Opening and Dressing Wool” that incorporated his flying shuttle. In previous looms, the shuttle was thrown, or passed, through the warp threads by hand, and wide fabrics required two weavers seated side by side passing the shuttle from left to right and then back again. Kay mounted his shuttle on wheels in a track and used paddles to shoot the shuttle from side to side when the weaver jerked a cord. Using the flying shuttle, one weaver could weave fabrics of any width more quickly than two could before.
