Drottningholm Palace, Royal palace, near Stockholm. It was designed by Nicodemus Tessin (1615–81) and built 1662–86. It shows French Baroque influences in its plan, gardens, and interior, but it also has Italian Classical elements and is capped by a Nordic sateri roof. A theatre attached to it was built in the 1760s and is preserved with its original sets and stage machinery as a theatrical museum. The palace was formerly the Swedish royal family’s summer residence.
