Batfish, any of about 60 species of fishes of the family Ogcocephalidae (order Lophiiformes), found in warm and temperate seas. Batfishes have broad, flat heads and slim bodies and are covered with hard lumps and spines. Some species have an elongated, upturned snout. Batfishes grow at most about 36 cm (14 inches) long. They are poor swimmers and usually walk on the bottom on thickened, limblike pectoral and pelvic fins. Most live in the deep sea, but some inhabit shallow water.
Batfishes are members of the group known as anglerfish and are equipped with a “fishing pole,” tipped with a fleshy “bait” to lure prey close enough to be eaten. The apparatus is located above the small mouth and, unlike that of other anglers, can be drawn into recess when not in use.
