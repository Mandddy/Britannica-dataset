Édouard Glissant,  (born September 21, 1928, Le Lamentin, Martinique—died February 3, 2011, Paris, France) French-speaking West Indian poet and novelist who belonged to the literary Africanism movement.
Glissant was a disciple and fellow countryman of the poet Aimé Césaire, who founded the Negritude movement to promote an African culture free of all colonial influences. Glissant recorded the awakening of colonized peoples in his verse collection Un Champ d’îles (1953; “An Expanse of Islands”) and in his epic poem Les Indes (1956; The Indies in bilingual edition). His novel La Lézarde (1958; “The Crack”; Eng. trans. The Ripening) won him France’s Prix Théophraste Renaudot (1958), an important annual award bestowed upon a novel. In Le Quatrième Siècle (1964; “The Fourth Century”), he retraced the history of slavery in Martinique and the rise of a generation of young West Indians, trained in European universities, who would reclaim their land. The narrative structure of his novel Malemort (1975) interweaves the colonial history of Martinique with an examination of contemporary experience, a technique he used again in La Case du commandeur (1981; “The Commander’s Cabin”). Glissant’s other verse collections include Boises (1977; “Woods”) and Pays rêvé, pays réel (1985; “Countries Dreamed, Countries Real”). The collection of poems Le Sel noir (1960) was published in English translation as Black Salt: Poems. Glissant’s play Monsieur Toussaint (published 1961) is about the Haitian hero Toussaint-Louverture. His book about William Faulkner, Faulkner, Mississippi (1996), appeared in English translation under the same title.
