Dolley Madison, née Dolley Payne, also called (1790–93) Dolley Todd, Dolley also spelled Dolly  (born May 20, 1768, Guilford county, North Carolina [U.S.]—died July 12, 1849, Washington, D.C., U.S.) American first lady (1809–17), the wife of James Madison, fourth president of the United States. Raised in the plain style of her Quaker family, she was renowned for her charm, warmth, and ingenuity. Her popularity as manager of the White House made that task a responsibility of every first lady who followed.
Dolley was one of eight children of John Payne, a merchant, and Mary Coles Payne. Soon after her birth, her father’s business fell on hard times and the family moved to eastern Virginia, where they were active members of the Society of Friends. When she was 15 her family moved to Philadelphia, where Dolley married a young lawyer, John Todd, in 1790. The couple had two children, but in 1793 her youngest son and husband died during an epidemic of yellow fever, widowing Dolley at 25.
