Shropshire, also called Salop,  administrative, geographic, and historic county of western England bordering on Wales. Historically, the county has been known as Shropshire as well as by its older, Norman-derived name of Salop. Shrewsbury, in central Shropshire, is the administrative centre.
The administrative, geographic, and historic counties cover somewhat different areas. The administrative county is bounded to the north by the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the unitary authority of Cheshire East, to the east by the administrative county of Staffordshire and the unitary authority of Telford and Wrekin, to the southeast by the administrative county of Worcestershire, to the south by the unitary authority of Herefordshire, and to the west by Wales. Until 2009 the administrative county was divided into five administrative entities: the districts of Bridgnorth, North Shropshire, and South Shropshire, the borough of Oswestry, and the borough of Shrewsbury and Atcham. The geographic county includes the entire administrative county and the unitary authority of Telford and Wrekin. The historic county is nearly coterminous with the geographic county, but two small areas within the geographic county lie outside the historic county: an area south of Market Drayton in North Shropshire belongs to the historic county of Staffordshire, and an area south of Ludlow in South Shropshire belongs to the historic county of Herefordshire. The historic county of Shropshire also includes a small area along the River Severn south of Upper Arley in Wyre Forest borough of the administrative county of Worcestershire.
