Great Basin National Park, scenic region in eastern Nevada, U.S., just west of Baker and about 40 miles (65 km) southeast of Ely. The area, previously part of Humboldt National Forest, was made into a national park in 1986. It has an area of 121 square miles (313 square km).
The park consists mainly of the southern part of the Snake Range, a chain of peaks that trend north-south and rise abruptly from the surrounding desert floor to reach an elevation of 13,065 feet (3,982 metres) at Wheeler Peak. The mountains receive sufficient precipitation to support forest cover, and near Wheeler Peakâ€™s summit is the southernmost permanent icefield in the United States. A principal attraction of the park is Lehman Caves, an intricate limestone cavern at the eastern base of Wheeler Peak. The park has groves of ancient bristlecone pines and the 75-foot- (23-metre-) high limestone Lexington Arch.
