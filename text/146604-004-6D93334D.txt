Northern Pacific Railway Company,  one of the northern transcontinental railroads of the United States, operating between St. Paul, Minn., and Seattle, Wash., and merged into the Burlington Northern in 1970.
The Northern Pacific was chartered by Congress in 1864 to build a line from Lake Superior westward to a port on the Pacific coast and was given a land grant of 40,000,000 acres (16,200,000 hectares). It nevertheless encountered difficulty in finding financial backing for its venture into a mostly unsettled wilderness until the Philadelphia banker Jay Cooke undertook to raise $100,000,000. In 1873 the railroad was approaching Bismarck, in the Dakota Territory, when Cookeâ€™s bank collapsed. The road went into receivership, and construction stopped for six years. In 1878 the railroad was taken over by Henry Villard, who built it westward to Helena in Montana Territory, where it was connected with the Oregon Railway to Seattle in Washington Territory in 1883.
