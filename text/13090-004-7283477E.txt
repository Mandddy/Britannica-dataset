Calash, also called calèche, or barouche,  (from Czech kolesa: “wheels”), any of various open carriages, with facing passenger seats and an elevated coachman’s seat joined to the front of the shallow body, which somewhat resembled a small boat. A characteristic falling hood over the rear seat gave the name calash to any folding carriage top. Most of the vehicles had four wheels, but some had two. A type used especially in Quebec was two wheeled, with one forward-facing seat, and a driver’s seat on the splashboard. Other types were almost identical to chaises and victorias.
