Jeté,  (French jeté: “thrown”), ballet leap in which the weight of the dancer is transferred from one foot to the other. The dancer “throws” one leg to the front, side, or back and holds the other leg in any desired position upon landing. Among the commonly seen forms of this step are the jeté battu, in which the legs are crossed in the air before the descent; the grand jeté, a broad, high leap with one leg stretched forward and the other back like a “split” in the air; and the jeté en tournant, or tour jeté (“flung turn”), in which the dancer executes a half-turn in the air away from the forward leg before landing on it.
