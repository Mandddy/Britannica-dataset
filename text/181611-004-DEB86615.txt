Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), member of the sleeper shark family Somniosidae (order Squaliformes, which also includes the dogfish family, Squalidae) that is the longest-living vertebrate known. The species is primarily found in the cold-water environments of the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic, from Baffin Bay eastward to the Barents Sea, but its range also extends southward to the North Sea and the waters adjacent to the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. Bulky, with a rounded snout, small fins relative to body size, and gray to brown coloration, Greenland sharks are similar to spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), except that they lack a spine in front of the second dorsal fin and usually the one on the first dorsal fin.
The Greenland shark is one of the largest cartilaginous fishes. It can reach a length of 7 metres (23 feet) and a weight of 1,025 kg (2,260 pounds) when fully grown, but most are between 2 and 4 metres (6.5 and 13 feet). Little is known, however, about how the species reproduces. Females are thought to reach sexual maturity when they surpass the 4-metre (13-foot) mark in length, which takes approximately 150 years to achieve. They are ovoviviparous (that is, eggs are retained within the body until they hatch) and produce an average of 10 offspring at a time. The type, amount, and duration of parental care the young receive are unknown, but scientists speculate that, like other shark species, Greenland sharks are independent from birth. No other vertebrate known has a life span as long as this species; radiocarbon dating of isotopes in the sharkâ€™s eye-lens nuclei suggests that the oldest Greenland sharks may be about 400 years old.
