Claude-Louis Berthollet,  (born Dec. 9, 1748, Talloires, Savoy, France—died Nov. 6, 1822, Arcueil) central French figure in the emergence of chemistry as a modern discipline in the late 18th century. He combined acute experimental skills with fundamental theoretical proposals about the nature of chemical reactions, eventually leading to the law of mass action.
Berthollet, born into a family of notaries of the Duchy of Savoy, was educated in Annecy and in 1770 took a medical degree from the University of Turin, the Savoyard capital. With the patronage of a famed Genevan physician, Theodore Tronchin, he established himself that year in Paris as physician to the wife of the duc d’Orléans. In 1778 Berthollet became a French citizen and began the process of obtaining a medical license from the Paris Faculty of Medicine. In 1779 he married Marguerite-Marie Baur, who bore him their only son, Amédée, in 1780. Berthollet continued his medical practice for several years while embarking upon a scientific career. His scientific research eventually turned him into one of the leading French chemists, second only to Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier.
