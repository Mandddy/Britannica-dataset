Hans Geiger, byname of Johannes Wilhelm Geiger   (born September 30, 1882, Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany—died September 24, 1945, Potsdam) German physicist who introduced the first successful detector (the Geiger counter) of individual alpha particles and other ionizing radiations.
Geiger was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Erlangen in 1906 and shortly thereafter joined the staff of the University of Manchester, where he became one of the most valuable collaborators of Ernest Rutherford. At Manchester, Geiger built the first version of his particle counter and used it and other radiation detectors in experiments that led to the identification of the alpha particle as the nucleus of the helium atom and to Rutherford’s correct proposal (1912) that, in any atom, the nucleus occupies a very small volume at the centre.
