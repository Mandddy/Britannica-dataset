Sapphire, byname of Ramona Lofton  (born August 4, 1950, Fort Ord, California, U.S.) American author of fiction and poetry that features unsparing though often empowering depictions of the vicissitudes of African American and bisexual life.
Lofton, whose father was a U.S. Army sergeant and whose mother was a member of the Women’s Army Corps (WAC), spent portions of her childhood in California, Texas, and West Germany. She briefly attended San Francisco City College in the 1970s, ultimately dropping out to immerse herself in the burgeoning countercultural movement. It was during this period that she changed her name to Sapphire, a reference both to the emerging New Age fascination with crystals and to the stereotype of a belligerent black woman derived from a character on The Amos ’n’ Andy Show (1928–60). In 1977 she moved to New York City, where she worked as an exotic dancer while honing her poetic skills at such venues as the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. Meditations on the Rainbow, her first book of poetry, was published in 1987.
