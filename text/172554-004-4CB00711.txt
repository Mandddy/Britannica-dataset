Pelagius II,  (born , Rome—died February 7, 590, Rome) pope from 579 to 590. Pelagius, who was of Gothic descent, was consecrated as Pope Benedict I’s successor on November 26, 579, without imperial confirmation. His pontificate was continually troubled by the Lombards who were besieging Rome and threatening the Italian peoples, for whom the papacy was responsible.
Pelagius sent the deacon Gregory (later Pope St. Gregory I the Great) as nuncio to Constantinople for aid from the Byzantine emperor Tiberius II. Involved in wars with Persia, Tiberius was unable to help, and for the first time in papal history Pelagius appealed to the Catholic Franks. In a letter (580) to the Frankish bishop of Auxerre he declared it was the Franks’ duty as Christians to defend Rome and Italy against the “deathly race” of the Lombards. Gregory persuaded Tiberius to approve Pelagius’s unprecedented appeal and to grant the Franks subsidies. Halted in their advance, the Lombards took up a defensive position, but, when the Franks withdrew, the Lombards threatened again, and Pelagius made an appeal to Tiberius’s successor, Maurice. The imperial representative in Italy, Exarch Smaragdus of Ravenna, finally negotiated peace in 585.
