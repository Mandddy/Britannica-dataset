Seizing,  means of fastening together two spars, two ropes, or two parts of the same rope by means of a third rope. Two parts of the same rope may be thus joined to make an eye, or closed circle.
When two ropes are joined and the strain on one is to be greater than that on the other, racking seizing is preferred. A simpler and more common method is round seizing.
