Austin Flint,  (born Oct. 20, 1812, Petersham, Mass., U.S.—died  March 13, 1886, New York, N.Y.) one of the most eminent of 19th-century physicians, and a pioneer of heart research in the United States. He discovered (1862) a disorder—now known as the Austin Flint murmur—characterized by regurgitation of blood from the aorta into the heart before contraction of the ventricles.
As professor of medicine at medical schools in Chicago, Buffalo, N.Y., Louisville, Ky., and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City (1861–86) and as president of the American Medical Association (1883–84), Flint had a great influence on the early course of medicine in the United States. A proponent of improved European diagnostic methods, he popularized the binaural stethoscope in the United States. His Treatise on the Principles and Practice of Medicine (1866) went through numerous editions.
