Canvasback (Aythya valisineria), bay duck, or pochard, of the family Anatidae, one of the most popular of game birds. The male canvasback is a relatively large duck, weighing about 1.4 kg (3 pounds). During the breeding season he has a red head and neck and a black breast, with white back and sides finely lined in gray. In eclipse plumage he resembles the female, with tan head and gray-brown back. Canvasbacks breed in northwestern North America and winter along the coasts from British Columbia and Massachusetts south to central Mexico. Canvasbacks prefer the roots of wild celery (eelgrass) where it is available but will eat many other plants and even some animal foods.
