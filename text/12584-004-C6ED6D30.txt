Benedetto Croce,  (born February 25, 1866, Pescasseroli, Italyâ€”died November 20, 1952, Naples) historian, humanist, and foremost Italian philosopher of the first half of the 20th century.
Croce belonged to a family of landed proprietors with estates in the Abruzzi region of central Italy but chiefly resident in Naples. His background was religious, monarchical, and conservative. Croce spent almost his whole life in Naples, becoming intimately identified with, and a keen observer of, its life, as well as a biographer of its heroes. His life, of which he left a too-modest record in his autobiography, falls roughly into four phases; each develops the dual theme of his intellectual and moral growth and his gradual, ever-deepening identification with the moral character and destiny of the Italian nation.
