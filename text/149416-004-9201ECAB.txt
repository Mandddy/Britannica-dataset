North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), an irregular fluctuation of atmospheric pressure over the North Atlantic Ocean that has a strong effect on winter weather in Europe, Greenland, northeastern North America, North Africa, and northern Asia. The NAO can occur on a yearly basis, or the fluctuations can take place decades apart. It is an “oscillation” because the changes in atmospheric pressure are essentially a back-and-forth switching between two prevailing patterns, or modes: a “positive mode,” in which a strong subtropical high is located over the Azores islands in the central North Atlantic while a strong low-pressure system is centred over Iceland, and a “negative mode,” in which weaker high- and low-pressure systems are found over the same locations. The first observations of this pattern were made by the Danish priest and missionary Hans Egede Saabye in the 1770s, but it was the British climatologist Sir Gilbert Walker who first coined the term North Atlantic Oscillation in the 1920s.
The phase of the oscillation (that is, whether the oscillation is in the positive or the negative mode) and the relative strength of the pressure gradient (that is, the difference in pressure between the high and low systems) are gauged by the NAO index, which was derived from air-pressure readings taken at sea level at stations in Iceland and the Azores (though readings collected at Lisbon have been used to represent the Azores at times). The most accurate index values result from calculating the pressure difference between the centre of the Icelandic low and the centre of the Azores high. Since the centres of these pressure cells actually may be located some distance away from the recording stations, a technique known as “principal components time-series analysis” is sometimes used to infer the pressure differences between the cells regardless of the location of the centre of the cell. Daily index values are often graphed in order to track day-to-day changes, but data also can be aggregated into monthly and yearly values in order to illuminate long-term patterns.
