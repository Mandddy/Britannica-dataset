Wes Anderson, in full Wesley Wales Anderson  (born May 1, 1969, Houston, Texas, U.S.) American director and screenwriter known for the distinctive visual aesthetic of his quirky comedies and for his collaboration with screenwriter and actor Owen Wilson.
Anderson and Wilson met while both were students at the University of Texas at Austin, and their working relationship began even prior to Anderson’s 1991 graduation with a degree in philosophy. Together they wrote the script for a short film called Bottle Rocket (1994), which was directed by Anderson and featured performances by Wilson and his brother Luke Wilson. The short film came to the attention of director and producer James L. Brooks, who sponsored a full-length version of the story. Retaining its title and cast, Bottle Rocket (1996) became Anderson’s first feature film.
