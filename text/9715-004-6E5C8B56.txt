Pan Gu, Wade-Giles romanization P’an Ku, also spelled Pangu,  central figure in Chinese Daoist legends of creation. Pan Gu, the first man, is said to have come forth from chaos (an egg) with two horns, two tusks, and a hairy body. Some accounts credit him with the separation of heaven and earth, setting the sun, moon, stars, and planets in place, and dividing the four seas. He shaped the earth by chiselling out valleys and stacking up mountains. All this was accomplished from Pan Gu’s knowledge of yinyang, the inescapable principle of duality in all things.
Another legend asserts that the universe derived from Pan Gu’s gigantic corpse. His eyes became the sun and moon, his blood formed rivers, his hair grew into trees and plants, his sweat turned to rivers, and his body became soil. The human race, moreover, evolved from parasites that infested Pan Gu’s body. These creation myths date from the 3rd to the 6th century. Artistic representations frequently depict Pan Gu as a dwarf clothed with leaves.
