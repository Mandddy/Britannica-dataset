In 1841 John Neely Bryan, a lawyer and trader from Tennessee, built the first cabin (now restored) in the area on the riverbank. Other settlers moved into the region, and a town site was laid out in 1844. The origin of the community’s name is uncertain; most likely it is named for early settler Joseph Dallas or for George Mifflin Dallas, vice president (1845–49) of the United States. Its early settlement was augmented by Swiss and German immigrants and in the late 1850s by French artisans from the unsuccessful Fourierist utopian colony at nearby La Réunion. Large numbers of African Americans moved into the area after the American Civil War.
