Sancho Panza, Don Quixote’s squire in the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, a short, pot-bellied peasant whose gross appetite, common sense, and vulgar wit serve as a foil to the mad idealism of his master. He is famous for his many pertinent proverbs. Cervantes used the psychological differences between the two characters to explore the conflict between the ideal and the real and based much of his novel’s narrative development on their personal relationship.
