Elia Kazan, original name Elia Kazanjoglous  (born September 7, 1909, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died September 28, 2003, New York, New York, U.S.) Turkish-born American director and author noted for his successes on the stage—especially with plays by Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller—as well as for his critically acclaimed films and for his role in developing a revolutionary style of acting that embodied psychological and behavioral truth. His reputation as one of the most accomplished and influential American stage and film directors of the 1940s, ’50s, and early ’60s was clouded by his cooperation in 1952 with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), to which he “named names,” identifying fellow artists as members of the Communist Party.
The child of ethnic Greeks who lived in Turkey, Kazan immigrated to New York City at age four with his parents (who shortened their surname from Kazanjoglous). His father operated a rug business and eventually moved the family to suburban New Rochelle. Kazan was educated at Williams College, where he felt like an outsider among his privileged, predominantly white Anglo-Saxon Protestant classmates. He then pursued an M.F.A. in drama at Yale University and married one of his classmates, playwright Molly Day Thatcher. In the early 1930s Kazan joined the Group Theatre in New York City, earning a reputation as a versatile performer and appearing in Waiting for Lefty and Golden Boy (both by Clifford Odets). In 1935, having embraced the Marxism that would remain a lifelong influence on him, Kazan joined the Communist Party. Roughly a year and a half later he left the party after refusing to take part in a strike at the Group. After the Group disbanded in 1941, Kazan established himself as a stage director with his assured stewardship of Thorton Wilder’s The Skin of Our Teeth (1942), as well as Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash, and S.J. Perelman’s One Touch of Venus (1943).
