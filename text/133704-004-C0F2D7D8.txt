Craigslist, formerly Craig’s list,  private corporation operating over the Internet to provide classified advertisements, community information services, and community forums. Most of these listings are restricted to specific locations, which include some 500 cities in 50 countries.
Craig’s list was launched in 1995 by Craig Newmark, a software engineer, as a free e-mail service that described upcoming events in the San Francisco Bay area of California. Over time, Newmark set up a Web site with a forum for members to communicate with one another. As an increasing number of users began to interact with the site, its content was adapted to accommodate more community participation. Following incorporation as Craigslist in 1999, the Web site began charging fees for classified job advertisements in major cities, which, along with brokered apartment listings in New York City, are its only source of revenue. Users can post information, join in local discussions, buy and sell goods in the classified section, and find jobs and romance.
