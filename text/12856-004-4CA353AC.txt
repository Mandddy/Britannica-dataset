George Rogers Clark,  (born November 19, 1752, Albemarle county, Virginia [U.S.]â€”died  February 13, 1818, near Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.) frontier military leader in the American Revolution, whose successes were factors in the award of the Old Northwest to the United States in the Treaty of Paris, concluding the war.
Trained by his grandfather, Clark engaged in surveying along the Ohio River in the mid-1770s. He became interested in the Kentucky country around Harrodsburg and opposed those who sought to establish an independent colony of Transylvania there. At the outbreak of the Revolution, Clark persuaded the Virginia government to make Kentucky a separate county and to authorize him to enlist troops for its defense against the British and Indians along the frontier.
