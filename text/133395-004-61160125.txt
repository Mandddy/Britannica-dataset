Charles, chevalier d’Éon de Beaumont,  (born Oct. 5, 1728, Tonnerre, Fr.—died  May 21, 1810, London) French secret agent from whose name the term “eonism,” denoting the tendency to adopt the costume and manners of the opposite sex, is derived.
His first mission was to the Russian empress Elizabeth in 1755, on which he seems to have disguised himself as a woman. After good service as a dragoon captain, he went to London in 1762, with the Duc de Nivernais (Louis Jules Mancini). On returning to Versailles with the Treaty of Paris ratified (1763), he received the cross of St. Louis. Sent back to London with secret instructions from the King for espionage, he became involved in a quarrel with the French ambassador but refused to return to France—afterward claiming that Louis XV had instructed him to redisguise himself as a woman and to hide in the city.
