Tel Ḥay, also spelled Tel Ḥai, orTel Chai,  former settlement, now a national memorial, in Upper Galilee, northern Israel, near the Lebanese border. One of the first Jewish settlements in northern Palestine, it was intermittently inhabited from 1905, and permanently settled as a pastoral camp and border outpost in 1918. The name (Hebrew: “Hill of Life”) is an onomatopoetic derivation from the former Arabic name, Talha.
According to the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between Great Britain and France (1916), an expanded Lebanon, including all of eastern Upper Galilee, was to come under French rule after World War I. This satisfied neither the Muslims, who desired an independent Arab Greater Syria, nor the Jews, who preferred British rule. After the war the Muslim Arabs began attacks both on the Christian villages of southern Lebanon and on the isolated Jewish settlements of Upper Galilee. Tel Ḥay and adjacent Kefar Gilʿadi were determined to defend themselves, and Tel Ḥay was reinforced from Jerusalem by members of ha-Shomer, the Jewish workers’ protective organization, under the command of Joseph Trumpeldor, Zionist pioneer and former hero of the tsarist army. On March 1, 1920, the settlement was attacked by a large band of Arabs; six of the defenders, including Trumpeldor, were killed. The resistance of Tel Ḥay not only became legendary throughout Jewish Palestine but also was an important factor in the final determination (December 1920) of the northern boundary of mandated Palestine, which, as finally drawn, gave all of Upper Galilee and a “finger” of territory reaching almost to the sources of the Jordan River to Great Britain, to the disadvantage of France. This territory became part of Israel upon its attainment of independence (1948).
