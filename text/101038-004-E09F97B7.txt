Yosano Akiko, also called Ho Sho   (born Dec. 7, 1878, near Ōsaka, Japan—died  May 29, 1942, Tokyo) Japanese poet whose new style caused a sensation in Japanese literary circles.
Akiko was interested in poetry from her school days, and with a group of friends she published a private poetry magazine. In 1900 she joined the Shinshisha (New Poetry Association) of Yosano Tekkan and began to contribute to his magazine Myōjō. She met Tekkan that year and the next year left her family and went to Tokyo, where she married him. The freshness and unconventionality of her poetry had already attracted attention; Midaregami (1901; Tangled Hair, 1935) brought her fame. Yume no hana (1906; “Dream Flowers”) revealed her developing art.
