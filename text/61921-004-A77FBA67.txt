Virginia Louisa Minor,  (born March 27, 1824, Caroline county, Va., U.S.—died Aug. 14, 1894, St. Louis, Mo.) American activist who was a tireless and shrewd campaigner for woman suffrage.
Little is known of Minor’s early life. In 1843 she married Francis Minor, a distant cousin and a lawyer, and they settled in St. Louis the following year. At the outbreak of the Civil War she became an active member of the St. Louis Ladies Union Aid Society, which shortly became the largest branch of the Western Sanitary Commission. The successful management by women of the complex activities of the society—collecting and distributing clothing and supplies, staffing army hospitals, helping in the field and even at the front—encouraged Minor’s belief that women deserved political equality.
