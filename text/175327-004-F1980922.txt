The Italian Job, British comedy caper film, released in 1969, that was a cult favourite in the United Kingdom.
Michael Caine starred as a recently released convict who assembles a group of eccentric thieves to enact an ingenious gold robbery in Italy. After an extended car chase—featuring a fleet of innocuous Mini Cooper vehicles—the gang escapes. In the mountains of Switzerland, however, their bus skids and hangs precariously on the edge of a cliff, leaving the robbers’ fate uncertain.
