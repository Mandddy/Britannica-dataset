Acanthite, a silver sulfide mineral (Ag2S) that is the most important ore of silver. It is abundant, with other silver minerals, in the sulfide mineral deposits of Kongsberg, Nor.; Kremnica, Slovakia; Zacatecas, Mex.; and the Comstock Lode, Nev., U.S.
Argentite is the high-temperature form of acanthite. Like several other sulfides, selenides, and tellurides of silver and copper, argentite forms isometric crystals at high temperatures. Upon cooling these crystals invert from isometric (cubic) to monoclinic structures while remaining unchanged in external appearance. For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
