Royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus), a hare-sized denizen of West Africa’s lowland rainforest that is the world’s smallest antelope. The similar dwarf antelope (Neotragus batesi) is only slightly bigger. Both belong to the Neotragini tribe of dwarf antelopes that includes the dik-dik, steenbok, klipspringer, and oribi.
The royal antelope has many physical similarities to the hare; it has overdeveloped hindquarters and hind legs nearly twice as long as its forelimbs, a short tail, big eyes, and transparent but small ears. It stands about 25 cm (10 inches) and weighs 2.5–3 kg (5.5–7 pounds). Females are slightly larger than males, which have short (2.5–3 cm [1–1.2 inch]) but sharp back-slanted spikes for horns. The coat colour is red- or golden-brown with a rufous collar and white underparts, chin, and undertail.
