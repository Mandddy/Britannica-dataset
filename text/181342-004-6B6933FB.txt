Joseph Thomson,  (born February 14, 1858, Penpont, Dumfries, Scotland—died August 2, 1895, London, England) Scottish geologist, naturalist, and explorer who was the first European to enter several regions of eastern Africa and whose writings are outstanding contributions to geographical knowledge, exceptional for their careful records and surveys. Thomson’s gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), the most common gazelle of eastern Africa, was named for him.
A member of the Royal Geographical Society’s expedition of 1878 to east-central Africa, he took charge after the death of the expedition’s leader, Alexander Keith Johnston, leading the party over unknown territory to the northern end of Lake Nyasa and then to Lake Tanganyika. An attempt to reach the Congo was thwarted by hostile Buye (Waruwa) tribesmen, and he returned to the east African coast by way of Tabora, in present-day Tanzania, discovering Lake Rukwa.
