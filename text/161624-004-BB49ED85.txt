Double Indemnity, American film noir, released in 1944, that was considered the quintessential movie of its genre. It followed the time-honoured noir plotline of a man undone by an evil woman.
The film was adapted by director Billy Wilder and writer Raymond Chandler from the 1935 novella by James M. Cain. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is an insurance representative whose obsession with bombshell Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) allows her to manipulate him into helping murder her husband so she can collect on his lucrative insurance policy. (“Double indemnity” refers to the insurance policy clause that calls for the beneficiary to be paid twice the face value of the policy in case of the policyholder’s accidental death.) The scheme seems to be going perfectly until Neff’s boss, insurance investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), suspects foul play and launches an investigation into the case.
