Sir William Siemens, in full Charles William Siemens, original name Karl Wilhelm Siemens  (born April 4, 1823, Lenthe, Prussia [now in Germany]—died  Nov. 19, 1883, London, Eng.) German-born English engineer and inventor, important in the development of the steel and telegraph industries.
After private tutoring, Siemens was sent to a commercial school at Lübeck in order to enter his uncle’s bank. But his elder brother, Werner Siemens, deciding that engineering was more suitable, sent him to a technical school at Magdeburg for three years. Financed by his uncle, he then studied chemistry, physics, and mathematics for a year at the University of Göttingen, where his brother-in-law was a professor of chemistry. Through his brother’s influence he became an apprentice-student, without fee, in an engineering factory making steam engines in Magdeburg. While there, he determined to sell Werner’s electroplating process; after modest success in Hamburg, William traveled to London, arriving in March 1843 with only a few pounds in cash. He sold the process to Elkingtons of Birmingham for £1,600. He returned to Germany to complete his studies and then went again to England in February 1844 with the intention of selling further inventions.
