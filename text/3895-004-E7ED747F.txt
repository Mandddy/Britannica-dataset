Guanaco,  (Lama guanacoe), South American member of the camel family, Camelidae (order Artiodactyla), closely related to the alpaca, llama, and vicuña, which are known collectively as lamoids. Unlike camels, lamoids do not have the characteristic camel humps; they are slender-bodied animals with long legs and necks, short tails, small heads, and large, pointed ears. They graze on grass and other plants. When annoyed, they spit. Lamoids are able to interbreed and to produce fertile offspring.
The guanaco, like the vicuña, is a wild lamoid that lives in small bands of females, usually led by a male. The guanaco ranges from the snow line to sea level throughout the Andes from Peru and Bolivia southward to Tierra del Fuego and other islands. The adult stands about 110 centimetres (43 inches) at the shoulder; it is pale brown above and white below, with a grayish head.
