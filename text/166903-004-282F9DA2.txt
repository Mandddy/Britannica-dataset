Salado River, Spanish Río Salado,  river in northeastern Buenos Aires province, Argentina. It rises at Lake El Chañar, which lies at an elevation of 130 feet (40 metres) above sea level on the border of Santa Fe province. The river flows through the Pampas generally southeastward for approximately 400 miles (640 km) to the Atlantic Ocean, where it empties into Samborombón Bay, 105 miles (170 km) southeast of the city of Buenos Aires.
The river meanders past the cities of Junín and General Belgrano and often flows through small lakes and marshland. Peripheral canalization of the lower course has improved the river’s drainage system. Before 1800 the Salado marked the frontier between Spanish colonization (to the northeast) and indigenous Indians (to the southwest).
