Anne of Austria, French Anne d’Autriche   (born Sept. 22, 1601, Valladolid, Spain—died  Jan. 20, 1666, Paris) queen consort of King Louis XIII of France (reigned 1610–43) and regent during the opening years of the reign of her son King Louis XIV (from 1643).
The eldest daughter of King Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria, Anne was married to the 14-year-old Louis XIII in November 1615. Throughout his life Louis treated her with a cool reserve. In 1625 the English George Villiers, 1st duke of Buckingham, created a scandal at the French court by revealing his passion for the Queen. Her plight worsened as the powerful Cardinal de Richelieu, Louis XIII’s chief minister from 1624 to 1642, sought to prevent her from exercising any influence over her husband. Anne took as her confidante the scheming Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, duchesse de Chevreuse. Anne and the queen mother, Marie de Médicis, failed in their attempt to persuade Louis to dismiss the Cardinal (the Day of Dupes, 1630).
