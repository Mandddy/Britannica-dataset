Georg Kaiser,  (born Nov. 25, 1878, Magdeburg, Ger.—died  June 4, 1945, Ascona, Switz.) leading German Expressionist dramatist.
Kaiser’s father was a merchant, and he apprenticed in the same trade. He went to Argentina as a clerk but contracted malaria and was forced to return to Germany. During a long convalescence he wrote his first plays, mainly satirical comedies that attracted little attention. His first success was Die Bürger von Calais (1914; The Burghers of Calais). Produced in 1917 at the height of World War I, the play was an appeal for peace in which Kaiser revealed his outstanding gift for constructing close-knit drama expressed in trenchant and impassioned language. He followed this with a series of plays in which he showed man in deadly conflict with the modern world of money and machines: Von Morgens bis Mitternachts (1916; From Morn to Midnight), and the Gas trilogy, consisting of Die Koralle (1917; The Coral), Gas I (1918), and Gas II (1920). Written in terse and fragmented prose, these plays established him as a leader of the Expressionist movement.
