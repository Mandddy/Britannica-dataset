Antoine Coysevox,  (born Sept. 29, 1640, Lyon—died  Oct. 10, 1720, Paris) French sculptor known for his decorative work at the palace of Versailles and for his portrait busts, which introduced a trend toward the sharpened depiction of individual character.
Of Spanish descent, Coysevox became a sculptor to King Louis XIV in 1666 and by 1679 was engaged at Versailles, enriching the Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors) and the Ambassador’s staircase and carving the brilliant equestrian relief of the King (c. 1688) for the Salon de la Guerre. He also executed much decorative sculpture for the royal gardens, notably the equestrian “Renown” and “Mercury” (1700–02). Other important works are the tombs of the finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1685–87; Saint-Eustache, Paris) and Cardinal Mazarin (1689–93; Louvre) and the votive group of Louis XIV on the high altar of Notre-Dame. These, like his formal portrait busts, have a marked Baroque character. His more intimate portrait sculptures, however, such as that of the Duchesse de Bourgogne as Diana (1710; Louvre), omit the Italianate swagger of Bernini and the formality of the state portraits and anticipate the naturalism and grace of the Rococo style. His principal students, including his nephews Nicolas and Guillaume Coustou, perpetuated his influence, especially on the development of French portrait sculpture in the 18th century.
