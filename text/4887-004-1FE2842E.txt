Clement L. Vallandigham, in full Clement Laird Vallandigham  (born July 29, 1820, Lisbon, Ohio, U.S.—died June 17, 1871, Lebanon, Ohio) politician during the American Civil War (1861–65) whose Southern sympathies and determined vendetta against the Federal government and its war policy resulted in his court-martial and exile to the Confederacy.
Admitted to the Ohio bar in 1842, Vallandigham was elected to the state legislature in 1845. While a member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1857–63), he was adamant against the principles and policies of the newly formed Republican Party, particularly as they related to the slavery issue. Of Southern ancestry, he idealized the Southern way of life, and he assumed leadership of the faction of Midwest Democrats, called Copperheads, who opposed the prosecution of the war against the South—a war they viewed as beneficial only to Eastern interests.
