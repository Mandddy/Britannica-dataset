Glenn Close,  (born March 19, 1947, Greenwich, Connecticut, U.S.) American actress who drew acclaim for her considerable range and versatility.
Close grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut, a town her ancestors had helped to found. Her father was a well-known surgeon who left the mansions and well-manicured lawns of Greenwich to open a medical clinic in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) when Close was 13. She spent several years in Africa and at boarding schools in Switzerland before returning to Connecticut to live with her grandmother and attend Rosemary Hall, an exclusive girlsâ€™ school in Greenwich. Following her high school graduation in 1965, Close spent several years touring Europe and the United States with a musical group called Up with People.
