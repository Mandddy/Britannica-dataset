Lakeland terrier, breed of dog originally used to hunt and kill foxes in the Lake District of England. Formerly known as the Patterdale terrier, the Lakeland terrier was bred for gameness when in pursuit of foxes and otters. Somewhat like a small Airedale terrier in appearance, it stands about 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm), weighs about 15 to 18 pounds (7 to 8 kg), and is characteristically a bold, friendly, sturdily built dog. Its dense, wiry, weather-resistant coat is commonly black and tan in colour.
