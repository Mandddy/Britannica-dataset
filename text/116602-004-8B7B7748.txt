Illinois River, navigable stream of northern and central Illinois, U.S. It is formed by the junction of the Des Plaines and Kankakee rivers in Grundy county, about 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Joliet. It flows generally west across the state until just north of Hennepin, where it turns abruptly south and flows generally southwest and south to join the Mississippi River at Grafton after a course of 273 miles (440 km). The Illinois drains an area of approximately 29,000 square miles (75,000 square km) and occasionally broadens into wide expanses such as Peoria Lake. The Illinois and Michigan Canal, constructed (1848) from the Chicago River to the Illinois River at a point near La Salle, made navigation between these streams and shipping between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico possible. The nearly 100-mile (160-km) canal ceased to be used when the Illinois Waterway (linking the Chicago River, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, and the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers) opened in 1933. (The canal and its banks, designated by the U.S. Congress in 1984 the country’s first national heritage corridor, are now used for recreational activities.)
Cities that are situated along the river’s course include Morris, Ottawa, La Salle, Peru, Peoria, Pekin, Havana, and Beardstown. In addition to the Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers, other tributaries include the Spoon, Sangamon, Fox, Vermilion, Mackinaw, and La Moine rivers. State parks along the Illinois River include Starved Rock, Buffalo Rock, and Illini (all near Ottawa) and Pere Marquette (near the confluence with the Mississippi River).
