Felix Wankel,  (born Aug. 13, 1902, Lahr, Ger.—died  Oct. 9, 1988, Lindau, W.Ger.) German engineer and inventor of the Wankel rotary engine. The Wankel engine is radically different in structure from conventional reciprocating piston engines. Instead of having pistons that move up and down in cylinders, the Wankel engine has a triangular orbiting rotor that turns in a closed chamber. Each quarter turn of the rotor completes an expansion or a compression of the gases inside the chamber, permitting the four functions characteristic of all internal-combustion engines—intake, compression, expansion, and exhaust—to be accomplished during one turn of the rotor. The only moving parts are the rotor and the output shaft. In theory, the advantages of this design include its light weight, few moving parts, compactness, low initial cost, fewer needed repairs, and relatively smooth performance.
Wankel never earned an engineering degree or acquired a driver’s license. The son of a forestry official in the Black Forest region of southern Germany, he grew up in straitened circumstances after his father was killed in World War I. As a young man, convinced that he could design a practical rotary engine (the concept was well known but usually dismissed as unworkable), he set up a small engineering business in Heidelberg while financing himself with other jobs such as bookselling. He was briefly a member of the Nazi Party before it rose to power. During the Nazi period and World War II he lived in Lindau, on Lake Constance (near the border with Switzerland), where he worked on designs for seals, unconventional rotary valves, and rotary engines for automobile and airplane engines. At various times he worked for the Daimler-Benz and BMW automobile companies as well as the German air force.
