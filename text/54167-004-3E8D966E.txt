Spiny-finned fish, also called spiny-rayed fish,  any member of the superorder Acanthopterygii, including four orders of marine and freshwater fishes having fins with some spiny (as opposed to soft) raysâ€”Atheriniformes, Beryciformes, Zeiformes, and Lampridiformes.
The atheriniform is the best known of the spiny-finned group, including flying fishes, guppies, mollies, swordtails, and California grunion. Beryciforms and zeiforms are mostly deep-bodied fishes a foot or less in length. Most lampridiforms are elongated, ribbonlike fishes; the giant oarfish can reach 8 m (25 feet) in length. Beryciforms, zeiforms, and lampridiforms are the most primitive groups of spiny-finned fishes. Most live in the open ocean, and relatively little is known of their natural history.
