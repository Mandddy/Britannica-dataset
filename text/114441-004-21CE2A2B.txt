Actinomycete (order Actinomycetales), any member of a heterogeneous group of gram-positive, generally anaerobic bacteria noted for a filamentous and branching growth pattern that results, in most forms, in an extensive colony, or mycelium. The mycelium in some species may break apart to form rod- or coccoid-shaped forms. Many genera also form spores; the sporangia, or spore cases, may be found on aerial hyphae, on the colony surface, or free within the environment. Motility, when present, is conferred by flagella. Many species of actinomycetes occur in soil and are harmless to animals and higher plants, while some are important pathogens, and many others are beneficial sources of antibiotics.
There are more than a dozen suborders of actinomycetes. However, the heterogeneous nature of those organisms has been a source of taxonomic instability, and many await a more certain classification. Of the specific types of actinomycetes, Nocardia asteroides, an aerobic species, is the primary cause of nocardiosis, an infection of the lungs, brain, or skin in humans. Dermatophilus congolensis causes dermatophilosis, a severe dermatitis of cattle, sheep, horses, and occasionally humans. Several species of Actinomyces cause the disease actinomycosis in humans and cattle. Many of the actinomycetes are sources of antibiotics such as streptomycin.
