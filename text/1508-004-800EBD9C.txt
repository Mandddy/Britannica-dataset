Bioceramics, ceramic products or components employed in medical and dental applications, mainly as implants and replacements. This article briefly describes the principal ceramic materials and surveys the uses to which they are put in medical and dental applications. For an explanation of important issues in biomedical uses of all materials (including ceramics), see materials science: Materials for medicine.
A major category of medical ceramics are those which repair or replace musculoskeletal hard connective tissues. For load-bearing hip prostheses, the principal ceramic is high-density, high-purity, fine-grained polycrystalline alumina (aluminum oxide, Al2O3). Alumina has excellent corrosion resistance, good biocompatibility, high wear resistance, and high strength. Other clinical applications include knee prostheses, bone screws, segmental bone replacements, and components for maxillofacial reconstruction.
