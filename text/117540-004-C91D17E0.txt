Wrasse, any of nearly 500 species of marine fishes of the family Labridae (order Perciformes). Wrasses range from about 5 cm (2 inches) to 2 metres (6.5 feet) or more in length. Most species are elongated and relatively slender. Characteristic features of the wrasses include thick lips, smooth scales, long dorsal and anal fins, and large, often protruding canine teeth in the front of the jaw.
Wrasses are found throughout the world in tropical and temperate seas. They are often abundant among coral reefs. Most wrasses are carnivorous and prey on marine invertebrates. Some small wrasses, however, such as young blueheads (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and Labroides species, act as cleaners for larger fishes. They pick off and eat the external parasites of groupers, eels, snappers, and other fishes that visit them periodically. This cleaning service is also performed by various other small fishes and by certain shrimps.
