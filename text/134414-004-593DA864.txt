Malachite,  a minor ore but a widespread mineral of copper, basic copper carbonate, Cu2CO3(OH)2. Because of its distinctive bright green colour and its presence in the weathered zone of nearly all copper deposits, malachite serves as a prospecting guide for that metal. Notable occurrences are at Nizhny Tagil, Siberia; Chessy, France; Tsumeb, Namibia; and Bisbee, Ariz., U.S. Malachite has been used as an ornamental stone and as a gemstone. It is more abundant and widespread than azurite, with which it is usually found. For detailed physical properties, see carbonate mineral (table).
