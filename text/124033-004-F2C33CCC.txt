Villanova University began in Philadelphia with a foundation established at St. Augustine Church in 1796 and with the founding of St. Augustine Academy (for men) in 1811. In 1842 church officials established the Augustinian College of Villanova outside Philadelphia in a town that later took its name from the school. The college was named for St. Thomas of Villanova, a 16th-century bishop from Valencia, Spain. Classes began in 1843, but after St. Augustine Church was burned during anti-Catholic riots in 1844, officials were forced by financial constraints to close the college temporarily in 1845–46. The college received a state charter in 1848, and the first B.A. degrees were awarded in 1855. The college again closed in 1857 but reopened in 1865. To the original liberal arts curriculum was added engineering in 1905, science in 1915, and business in 1922. Graduate-level programs began to be separately administered in 1931. The college was elevated to university status in 1953, the year that the College of Nursing and the School of Law were formed. The school became coeducational in 1968.
