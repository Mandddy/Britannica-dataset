Giuseppe Tartini,  (born April 8, 1692, Pirano, Istria, Republic of Venice [now Piran, Slovenia]—died February 26, 1770, Padua, Republic of Venice) Italian violinist, composer, and theorist who helped establish the modern style of violin bowing and formulated principles of musical ornamentation and harmony.
Tartini studied divinity and law at Padua and at the same time established a reputation as a fencer. Before the age of 20 he secretly married a protégée of the archbishop of Padua, resulting eventually in his arrest. Disguised as a monk, he fled from Padua and took refuge in a monastery at Assisi. There his violin playing attracted attention and ultimately influenced the archbishop to allow Tartini to return to his wife in Padua. In 1716 he went to Venice, later to Ancona, and eventually back to Padua, where he was appointed principal violinist at the Church of San Antonio in 1721. He directed the orchestra of the chancellor of Bohemia in Prague (1723–26), then returned once again to Padua, where he founded (1728) a school of violin playing and composition. He made a concert tour of Italy in 1740.
