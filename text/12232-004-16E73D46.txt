Johann Gustav Droysen,  (born July 6, 1808, Treptow, Pomerania [Germany]—died  June 19, 1884, Berlin) historian and politician whose belief in Prussia’s destiny to lead Germany influenced German unification, which he lived to see. Ironically, his ardent Prussian patriotism did not save him from falling into disfavour after the revolutionary events of 1848, because his other views were generally liberal and individualistic.
Droysen’s devotion to Prussia began in his boyhood, during the War of Liberation against Napoleonic rule. While professor of classical philology at Berlin (1835–40), he wrote on Alexander the Great and used the term Hellenism to describe the diffusion of Greek culture over the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East in the 4th–1st centuries bc.
