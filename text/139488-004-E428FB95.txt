Thierry Henry, in full Thierry Daniel Henry  (born August 17, 1977, Châtillon, France) French football (soccer) player who scored more international goals than any other player in France’s history and who is considered one of the most prolific goal scorers of his time.
Henry, of French West Indian ancestry, spent his childhood in low-income housing in Les Ulis, south of Paris. He joined FC Versailles in 1992, and, after attracting other club scouts, he was signed by AS Monaco in 1995. Although Henry played as a striker until he was 17, he switched to left wing for Monaco. Monaco won the 1997 French club championship, and Henry’s game noticeably improved. Midway through the 1998–99 season, a contract mix-up almost sent him to Real Madrid; instead, he was transferred to Juventus in Turin, Italy, for £9 million. Seven months later he was on the move again in a £10.5-million deal to join English powerhouse Arsenal.
