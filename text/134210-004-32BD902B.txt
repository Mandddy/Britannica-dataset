Juan Valera y Alcalá Galiano,  (born Oct. 18, 1824, Cabra, Spain—died  April 18, 1905, Madrid) important Spanish 19th-century novelist and stylist, also a diplomat and politician. Valera travelled to Europe and America in the diplomatic corps and served as deputy, senator and under-secretary of state in Madrid.
His novels are characterized by deep psychological analysis of the characters, especially women. He was opposed to naturalistic narrative and held that the novel was a form of poetry. His best known works are Pepita Jiménez (1874), notable for its terse, elegant style and masterful character development, Doña Luz (1879) and Juanita la Larga (1895). Other important novels are Las ilusiones del doctor Faustino (1875), Morsamor (1899) and El comendador Mendoza (1877). Valera’s prolific literary output includes some very fine translations, including parts of Goethe’s Faust and Daphnis and Chloe (1907); literary criticism of Don Quixote, Faust, and other works; short stories, including El pájaro verde (1887; “The Green Bird”); plays (La venganza de Atahualpa); and numerous essays on religion, philosophy, history and politics. His letters to intellectual figures such as Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo and Leopoldo de Cueto constitute a valuable record of his impressions on many topics of the era.
