Hula, sensuous mimetic Hawaiian dance, performed sitting or standing, with undulating gestures to instruments and chant. Originally, the hula was a religious dance performed by trained dancers before the king or ordinary people to promote fecundity, to honour the gods, or to praise the chiefs. Wristlets and anklets of whale teeth or bone and necklaces and fillets of leis (interwoven flowers) were common ornaments. The women wore short skirts (paâ€˜us) and the men tapa loincloths (malos).
In 1820 New England missionaries compelled the native women to replace their hula skirts with long dresses (holokus). The resulting loss of sensuality in the dance was balanced in the music by expansion, under the influence of hymns, of the two- or three-note scale of the Hawaiian chant (mele). Further modification of the hula came when Portuguese sailors introduced the machada, the small guitar from which the ukelele developed.
