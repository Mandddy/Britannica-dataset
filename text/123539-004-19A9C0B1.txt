Cannabis (genus Cannabis), plant belonging to the family Cannabaceae of the nettle order (Urticales). By some classifications, the genus Cannabis comprises a single species, hemp (C. sativa), a stout, aromatic, erect annual herb that originated in Central Asia and is now cultivated worldwide, including in Europe, southern Asia, the Middle East, India, Africa, and the Americas. A tall, canelike variety is raised for the production of hemp fibre, while the female plant of a short, branchier variety is prized as the more abundant source of the psychoactive substance tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient of marijuana. Morphological differences in wild and cultivated forms of cannabis have introduced taxonomic uncertainties. Hence, in addition to C. sativa, some scientists consider the genus as including a second species, C. indica, or even a third, C. ruderalis.
