BlackBerry, wireless handheld communications device manufactured by the Canadian company Research in Motion (RIM).
The BlackBerry’s roots go back to the RIM 850, a pager created by RIM in 1999. Featuring a tiny keyboard, the device provided wireless e-mail access, allowing users to send and receive messages while on the go. Soon after, RIM released a faster, more powerful device, the RIM 857. The 857 looked more like a personal digital assistant (PDA) and could sync up with personal and business e-mail accounts. Sales of these new devices started off slowly, with only 25,000 users the first year, but those numbers quickly grew. The first BlackBerry devices were released in the early 2000s. Offering cellular phone service, wireless e-mail capability, and Internet access, the new “smartphones” took the business world by storm. Cellular phone providers soon began adding BlackBerry-capable phones to their offerings.
