Patty Berg, byname of Patricia Jane Berg  (born February 13, 1918, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.—died September 10, 2006, Fort Myers, Florida) American golfer, winner of more than 80 tournaments, including a record 15 major women’s championships, and first president of the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA).
Berg began playing golf at the age of 13 and soon showed a remarkable talent for the game. In 1935 she won the Minnesota state women’s championship and reached the final round of the national women’s amateur championship. In 1936 she repeated as state champion and won several lesser national tournaments. The following year she was again defeated in the finals of the national championship, but in 1938 she capped a season of 9 victories in 12 tournaments by winning the national women’s amateur title. She reduced her tournament schedule on entering the University of Minnesota in 1939, and an appendectomy prevented her from defending her national title that year.
