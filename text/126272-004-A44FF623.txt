Chromium processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products.
Chromium (Cr) is a brilliant, hard, refractory metal that melts at 1,857 째C (3,375 째F) and boils at 2,672 째C (4,842 째F). In the pure state it is resistant to ordinary corrosion, resulting in its application as an electroplated protective coating for other metals. It dissolves in nonoxidizing mineral acids but not in aqua regia or nitric acid, which passivate the metal.
