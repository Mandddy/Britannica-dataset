Alexandre-François Desportes,  (born 1661, Champigneulle, France—died  April 20, 1743, Paris) French painter who specialized in portraying animals, hunts, and emblems of the chase; he was among the first 18th-century artists to introduce landscape studies using nature as a model.
At the age of 12 Desportes was sent by his father to Paris, where he worked and studied in the studio of Nicasius Bernaerts, an artist who taught him to observe nature carefully. Desportes executed small decorative works for other artists, and he enjoyed considerable success at portraiture. Desportes was invited by King John III Sobieski to the court of Poland (1695–96), where he painted a number of portraits of members of the royal family.
