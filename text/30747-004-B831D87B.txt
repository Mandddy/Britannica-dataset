Snipefish, also called bellows fish ,  any of about 11 species in 3 genera of marine fishes of the family Macroramphosidae (order Gasterosteiformes) found in deeper tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Snipefishes are small, deep-bodied fishes that grow to 30 cm (12 inches) in length. They are commonly silver, pink, purple, or red and swim in a head-down position. They have long, narrow, tubular snouts that end in a small, toothless mouth. Snipefishes often bear a partial coating of armoured plates along the back. They spawn pelagic (that is, open-ocean drifting) eggs which do not receive parental care.
Snipefishes are often referred to as “bellows fish” because of their resemblance to a hand-driven bellows. Snipefishes possess an erect dorsal fin that contains several spines. The longest of these spines and the fish’s tail appear to form the “handles” of the bellows, whereas the fish’s tubular snout forms the “nozzle.”
