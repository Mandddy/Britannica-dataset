Lady Windermere’s Fan, comedy of manners in four acts by Oscar Wilde, performed in 1892 and published the following year.
Set in London, the play’s action is put in motion by Lady Windermere’s jealousy over her husband’s apparent interest in Mrs. Erlynne, a beautiful older woman with a mysterious past. Unknown to 21-year-old Lady Windermere, Mrs. Erlynne is really her divorced mother who for 20 years has been presumed dead. Lord Windermere is merely hoping to ease the older woman’s reentrance into society, which she attempts under a pseudonym, so that she may be reunited with her daughter. In a fit of pique, Lady Windermere goes to the rooms of her ardent admirer, Lord Darlington. Mrs. Erlynne follows closely, saving her daughter from scandal by an act of generosity that ruins her own chances.
