Ava,  ancient capital of central Myanmar (Burma), on the left bank of the Irrawaddy River at the Myitnge confluence. It is linked by a road and rail bridge, 5,894 feet (1,796 m) long, to the town of Sagaing; this is the only place where the Irrawaddy is bridged. Its name is a corruption of the Burmese Inwa, meaning “entrance to the lake.” The site was chosen in 1364 by the Shans who succeeded the Pagan dynasty. The location allowed the Shans to control the rice supply from the Kyaukse irrigated area to the south, which became vital after the traditional rice-growing area in southern Myanmar had been lost to a Mon kingdom. Ava flourished until destroyed by a rival group of Shans in 1527. In 1634 it again became the Myanmar capital under the Toungoo dynasty. Although it fell to the Mons in 1752, Alaungpaya, the Myanmar leader, recovered it; but he chose Shwebo (60 miles [100 km] north) as his capital. When Alaungpaya founded the Konbaung dynasty, Ava served as capital (1765–83 and 1823–37). Although the dynasty frequently changed capitals and built Amarapura (1783) and Mandalay (1857), its seat was always referred to by outsiders as the “Court of Ava.” From the 15th century, Europeans used the term Ava as a synonym for central and northern Myanmar. Little remains at the site except for a monastery.
