Sergey Aleksandrovich Yesenin,  Yesenin also spelled Esenin   (born Oct. 3 [Sept. 21, Old Style], 1895, Konstantinovo, Ryazan province, Russia—died  Dec. 27, 1925, Leningrad) the self-styled “last poet of wooden Russia,” whose dual image—that of a devout and simple peasant singer and that of a rowdy and blasphemous exhibitionist—reflects his tragic maladjustment to the changing world of the revolutionary era.
The son of a peasant family of Old Believers, he left his village at 17 for Moscow and later Petrograd (subsequently Leningrad, now St. Petersburg). In the cities he became acquainted with Aleksandr Blok, the peasant poet Nikolay Klyuyev, and revolutionary politics. In 1916 he published his first book, characteristically titled for a religious feast day, Radunitsa (“Ritual for the Dead”). It celebrates in church book imagery the “wooden Russia” of his childhood, a world blessed by saints in painted icons, where storks nest in chimneys and the sky above the birch trees is a bright blue scarf.
