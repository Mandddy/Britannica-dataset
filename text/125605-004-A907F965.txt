Macaroon,  cookie or small cake made of sugar, egg white, and almonds, ground or in paste form, or coconut. The origin of the macaroon is uncertain. The name is applied generally to many cookies having the chewy, somewhat airy consistency of the true macaroon.
Cake flour is often used as a base for the essential ingredients of macaroons. These are worked together and flavoured with vanilla and salt. The resulting dough is squeezed through a pastry bag onto a cookie sheet and allowed to stand. Prior to baking, it is often glazed with gum arabic or decorated with chopped almonds, walnuts, raisins, or cherry bits. Macaroon crumbs are often added to ice creams, pie fillings, and puddings. Frangipane is a cream filling made by flavouring butter and crushed macaroons with lemon extract, rum, sherry, or brandy.
