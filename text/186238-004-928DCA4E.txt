Yves Klein,  (born April 28, 1928, Nice, France—died June 6, 1962, Paris) French artist associated with the Parisian Nouveau Réalisme movement championed by the French critic Pierre Restany. The only painter in the founding group, Klein was a highly influential artist whose radical techniques and conceptual gestures laid the groundwork for much of the art of the 1960s and ’70s. His media were pure pigments, gold leaf, fire, water, live nude models (his “living brushes”), actions, and events.
Although Klein had no formal training in art, both his parents were artists, so he early on understood the power of the imagination as made manifest through idea, form, and particularly colour. In his early 20s Klein began his study of Rosicrucianism, a set of esoteric spiritual teachings, which would play a key role in his evolving mystical beliefs. In 1955 Klein settled in Paris after a stay in London and travels to Ireland, Spain, and Japan. While in Japan, Klein studied judo, achieving the black belt (master) level. He taught classes in that system of unarmed combat for several years.
