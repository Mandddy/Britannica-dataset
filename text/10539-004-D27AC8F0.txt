Nora Kaye, original name Nora Koreff  (born Jan. 17, 1920, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Feb. 28, 1987, Los Angeles, Calif.) American dramatic ballerina, called the “Duse of the Dance.”
Nora Koreff began taking dance lessons at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School at the age of eight. At age 15 she joined the Met’s corps de ballet, and, after further training under Michel Fokine and George Balanchine, she joined the Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre) at its formation in 1939. By then she had altered her surname to Kaye. For a time in the later 1930s she became interested in Broadway and danced in a number of musical productions, including Virginia (1937), Great Lady (1938), and Stars in Your Eyes (1939).
