Huon River, river in southern Tasmania, Australia, rising on the slopes of Mounts Wedge, Bowen, and Anne. It flows south and then, blocked by the Arthur Range, east to be joined by its tributaries, the Weld and Picton rivers, below Huon Gorge. Turning southeast, it passes Huonville at the limit of navigation and enters a wide estuary after a course of 105 miles (170 km). At Geeveston the estuary bends eastward to flow into the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. The river was named in 1792 by the French admiral Bruni d’Entrecasteaux for his second-in-command, Huon de Kermadec. Although only about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Hobart, the river’s lower valley was settled only sparsely until the 1850s because of its heavily wooded and swampy character. The area, encompassing the Huon Peninsula, later became intensively cultivated, with some of the highest rural population densities in Tasmania. The apple industry especially flourished, and fruit production continues to be of some importance. The valley is accessible from Hobart via the Huon and Channel highways and is a popular tourist region attracting many who seek an artistic retreat from urban life.
