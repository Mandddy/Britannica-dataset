Triglyceride, any one of an important group of naturally occurring lipids (fat-soluble components of living cells). Triglycerides are esters in which three molecules of one or more different fatty acids are linked to the alcohol glycerol; they are named according to the fatty acid components; e.g., tristearin contains three molecules of stearic acid, and oleodistearin, one of oleic acid and two of stearic acid. The types of triglycerides in animals vary with the species and the composition of fats in the food.
Triglycerides in animals and probably in plant seeds function as depots of energy. In mammals they are stored in adipose tissue until needed, at which time they are broken down to a molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acid. The latter combine with albumin, a protein in blood plasma, and are carried in the bloodstream to sites of utilization. Triglycerides also serve as insulation and padding for organs in animals.
