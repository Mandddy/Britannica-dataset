Agent, also called softbot (“software robot”),  a computer program that performs various actions continuously and autonomously on behalf of an individual or an organization. For example, an agent may archive various computer files or retrieve electronic messages on a regular schedule. Such simple tasks barely begin to tap the potential uses of agents, however. This is because an intelligent agent can observe the behaviour patterns of its users and learn to anticipate their needs or at least their repetitive actions. Such intelligent agents frequently rely on techniques from other fields of artificial intelligence, such as expert systems and neural networks, and aim to achieve complex goals.
Intelligent agents possess, to varying degrees, autonomy, mobility, a symbolic model of reality, a capacity to learn from experience, and an ability to cooperate with other agents and systems. An intelligent agent is most frequently classified by the role that it performs. For example, Web spiders that continually traverse the Web and index its sites are often built as agents. Thus far, the most-useful agents have been developed for Internet assistance. Chatterbots, another type of Internet agent, provide assistance to Web site visitors by conducting a dialogue with them to determine their needs and to service their more routine requests. In malicious or criminal uses, agents are deployed in botnets in order to attack computer systems by a barrage of messages in denial-of-service attacks.
