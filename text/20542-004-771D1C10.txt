DVD, in full digital video disc or digital versatile disc,  type of optical disc used for data storage and as a platform for multimedia. Its most prominent commercial application is for playing back recorded motion pictures and television programs (hence the designation “digital video disc”), though read-only, recordable, and even erasable and rewritable versions can be used on personal computers to store large quantities of almost any kind of data (hence “digital versatile disc”).
The DVD represents the second generation of compact disc (CD) technology, and, in fact, soon after the release of the first audio CDs by the Sony Corporation and Philips Electronics NV in 1982, research was under way on storing high-quality video on the same 120-mm (4.75-inch) disc. In 1994–95 two competing formats were introduced, the Multimedia CD (MMCD) of Sony and Philips and the Super Density (SD) disc of a group led by the Toshiba Corporation and Time Warner Inc. By the end of 1995 the competing groups had agreed on a common format, to be known as DVD, that combined elements of both proposals, and in 1996 the first DVD players went on sale in Japan.
