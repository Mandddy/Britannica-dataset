Edmund Waller,  (born March 3, 1606, Coleshill, Hertfordshire, Eng.—died  Oct. 21, 1687, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire) English poet whose adoption of smooth, regular versification prepared the way for the heroic couplet’s emergence by the end of the century as the dominant form of poetic expression. His importance was fully recognized by his age. “Mr. Waller reformed our numbers,” said John Dryden, who, with Alexander Pope, followed him and raised the couplet to its most concentrated form.
Waller was educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge and entered Parliament while still a young man. In 1631 he married the heiress of a wealthy London merchant, but she died three years later. He then paid unsuccessful court to Lady Dorothy Sidney (whom he addressed in poetry as Sacharissa) and in 1644 married Mary Bracey.
