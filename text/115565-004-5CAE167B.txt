George Herbert,  (born April 3, 1593, Montgomery Castle, Wales—died  March 1, 1633, Bemerton, Wiltshire, Eng.) English religious poet, a major metaphysical poet, notable for the purity and effectiveness of his choice of words.
A younger brother of Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury, a notable secular metaphysical poet, George in 1610 sent his mother for New Year’s two sonnets on the theme that the love of God is a fitter subject for verse than the love of woman, a foreshadowing of his poetic and vocational bent.
