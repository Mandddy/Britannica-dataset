Isabella Valancy Crawford,  (born Dec. 25, 1850, Dublin, Ire.—died  Feb. 12, 1887, Toronto, Ont., Can.) major 19th-century Canadian poet and one of the first important woman poets in Canada. She is especially noted for her vivid descriptions of the Canadian landscape.
Details of Crawford’s life are sketchy. The daughter of a physician who emigrated to Canada in 1858, she spent most of her girlhood in the picturesque Kawartha Lakes district of Ontario. She received an excellent education at home and was widely read in the classics and in French and Italian literature. From 1875 until her death, she and her widowed mother lived in Toronto, meagrely sustained by the sale of her stories and poems to Toronto newspapers and to magazines in the United States.
