Mary Ann Lamb,  (born December 3, 1764, London, England—died May 20, 1847, London) English writer, known for Tales from Shakespear, written with her brother Charles.
Born into a poor family, Mary Lamb received little formal education. From an early age she helped support the family by doing needlework. Her mother was an invalid, and for many years she was entirely dependent on Mary’s care. On September 22, 1796, in a fit of madness, Mary stabbed and killed her mother. It is believed that there was a hereditary strain of mental illness in the family and that Mary’s illness was precipitated by overwork. She was declared temporarily insane and placed under the guardianship of her brother Charles. For the rest of her life Mary was subject to recurrent bouts of mental illness.
