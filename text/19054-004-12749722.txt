A. Mitchell Palmer, in full Alexander Mitchell Palmer   (born May 4, 1872, Moosehead, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 11, 1936, Washington, D.C.) American lawyer, legislator, and U.S. attorney general (1919–21) whose highly publicized campaigns against suspected radicals touched off the so-called Red Scare of 1919–20.
A devout Quaker from his youth, Palmer—later nicknamed the “Fighting Quaker”—was educated at Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1893, practiced law at Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and became active in state Democratic Party affairs. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1909–15) and played a prominent role in securing the Democratic presidential nomination for Woodrow Wilson in 1912. He ran for the Senate in 1914 but was defeated. Upon U.S. entry into World War I, Palmer was appointed alien-property custodian. In 1919 he was named U.S. attorney general by President Wilson. During his two years at that post, he used the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 as a basis for launching an unprecedented campaign against political radicals, suspected dissidents, left-wing organizations, and aliens. He deported the self-avowed anarchist Emma Goldman and others suspected of subversive activities. On January 2, 1920, government agents in 33 cities rounded up thousands of persons, many of whom were detained without charge for long periods. The disregard of basic civil liberties during the “Palmer raids,” as they came to be known, drew widespread protest and ultimately discredited Palmer, who nevertheless justified his program as the only practical means of combating what he believed was a Bolshevik conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government. Although he lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 1920, Palmer remained active in the Democratic Party until his death, campaigning for, among others, presidential candidates Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
