Lizardfish, any of about 57 species of marine fish of the family Synodontidae, found primarily in the tropics. Lizardfish are elongated with rounded bodies and scaly heads. They grow to a maximum length of about 50 centimetres (20 inches) and are characteristically mottled or blotched to blend with their surroundings. Most lizardfish live in shallow water. They tend to frequent sandy or muddy areas, and sometimes lie partly buried in the bottom. They are carnivorous and prey on fish, holding the catch with their many sharp teeth. They are sometimes taken by fishermen but are not generally considered good to eat.
