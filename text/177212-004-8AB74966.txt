A Face in the Crowd, American film drama, released in 1957, that was especially noted for the performance by Andy Griffith in his movie debut.
Griffith portrayed the charismatic, but manipulative, country singer Larry (“Lonesome”) Rhodes, who is idolized by the very masses he disdains in private. Patricia Neal and Lee Remick (also in her film debut) are among the women he uses and discards. The film builds to a shattering conclusion when Rhodes’s true feelings are revealed to his fans.
