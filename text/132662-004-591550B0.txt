Graham Chapman,  (born Jan. 8, 1941, Leicester, Leicestershire, Eng.—died Oct. 4, 1989, Maidstone, Kent) British comedian and writer, founding member of the Monty Python troupe, which set a standard during the 1970s for its quirky parodies and wacky humour on television and later in films.
After graduating from Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1962), and from St. Bartholomew’s Hospital Medical School (1966), Chapman practiced medicine briefly before turning to the entertainment industry. He wrote for The [David] Frost Report and other television shows and performed in the 1967 series At Last the 1948 Show. First airing on Oct. 5, 1969, Monty Python’s Flying Circus startled viewers with its send-ups of standard television fare such as celebrity interviews. Chapman, often shown wearing a tweed jacket and smoking a pipe, perfected absurd characters, notably the Army Colonel and Raymond Luxury-Yacht. Along with Python member John Cleese, he was the coauthor of most of the troupe’s works, including the films Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) and Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979). Chapman recounted his successful battle with alcoholism and his life as a homosexual in A Liar’s Autobiography: Volume VII (1980).
