Gaucho, the nomadic and colourful horseman and cowhand of the Argentine and Uruguayan Pampas (grasslands), who flourished from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century and has remained a folk hero similar to the cowboy in western North America. The term also has been used to refer to cowhands and other people of Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil.
Gauchos were usually mestizos (persons of mixed European and Indian ancestry) but sometimes were white, black, or mulatto (of mixed black and white ancestry). From their own ballads and legends a literature of the gaucho—la literatura gauchesca—grew and became an important part of the Argentine cultural tradition. Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, Argentine writers celebrated them. Examples include José Hernández’s epic poem El gaucho Martín Fierro (1872) and Ricardo Güiraldes’ novel Don Segundo Sombra (1926).
