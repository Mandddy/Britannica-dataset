Tamale, Spanish Tamal, plural Tamales,  in Mexican cuisine, small steamed cake of dough made from corn (maize). In the preparation of tamales, masa harina, fine-ground corn treated with unslaked lime, is made into a thick paste. For each tamale the masa dough is spread on a corn husk, a small amount of filling added, and the whole wrapped into a package and tied with a strip of husk. The tamales are steamed until cooked through.
There are dozens of local variations in the dough and filling for tamales. Banana leaves form the wrappers on the Gulf Coast and in the Yucatán. The uchepos of Morelia and tamales dulces of Jalisco employ fresh rather than dried corn. Fillings may contain meat, cheese, chilis, herbs, fish, and vegetables in savoury or sweet combinations; some tamales are even cooked “blind,” with no filling.
