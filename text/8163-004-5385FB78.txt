Old English sheepdog, shaggy working dog developed in early 18th-century England and used primarily in driving sheep and cattle to market. A compact dog with a shuffling, bearlike gait, the dog stands 21 to 26 inches (53 to 66 cm) and generally weighs over 55 pounds (25 kg). Its dense coat is weather-resistant and long enough to cover the eyes, though it does not obscure vision. The coat may be gray or blue-gray, with or without white markings. The dog is often called “bobtail” because its tail is usually removed soon after birth.
