Julius Rosenwald,  (born August 12, 1862, Springfield, Illinois, U.S.—died January 6, 1932, Chicago) American merchant and unorthodox philanthropist who opposed the idea of perpetual endowments and frequently offered large philanthropic gifts on condition that they be matched by other donations. He was especially noted for his aid to the education of blacks.
After moderate success in the clothing business in New York City (1879–85) and Chicago (1885–95), Rosenwald bought a one-fourth interest in Sears, Roebuck and Co., which became the world’s largest mail-order house and chain of retail stores. In 1910 he succeeded Richard Warren Sears as president, and in 1925 he was named chairman of the Sears board of directors. Rosenwald and A.H. Loeb, treasurer of the company, established an exemplary savings and profit-sharing program for employees. Under Rosenwald’s leadership, Sears began to manufacture its own merchandise and instituted the policy of guaranteeing full refunds to dissatisfied customers.
