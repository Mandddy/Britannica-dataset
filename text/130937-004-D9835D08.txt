James E. Clyburn, in full James Enos Clyburn  (born July 21, 1940, Sumter, S.C., U.S.) American politician who served as a Democratic congressman from South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives (from 1993). He was the second African American and the first South Carolinian to serve as majority whip (2006–11). He later served as assistant leader of the Democrats (2011– ).
Growing up in South Carolina during a time of intense racial discrimination and segregation, Clyburn became an active participant in the civil rights movement, as did other members of his family. He served as president of the local youth chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and participated in many demonstrations, including a 1961 march on the South Carolina State House, for which he was jailed. He graduated from South Carolina State College the same year. While living in Charleston, S.C., Clyburn worked as a public school history teacher, an employment counselor, and a director of two local youth programs and a farmworkers’ program before running a failed bid for the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1970. After his loss he was invited to work as an adviser to South Carolina Gov. John Carl West, and four years later he was appointed the state’s human affairs commissioner (1974–92). In 1992 he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first African American since 1897 to serve as a U.S. representative from his state.
