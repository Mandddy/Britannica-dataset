Rosie O’Donnell, byname of Roseanne O’Donnell  (born March 21, 1962, Commack, New York, U.S.) American actress of film, television, and stage who was perhaps best known for her hosting duties on the talk shows The Rosie O’Donnell Show (1996–2002) and The View (2006–07).
At age 10 O’Donnell’s mother died, and she used humour to deal with her emotions. Throughout her youth her sense of humour also gained her popularity, and she was elected homecoming queen, senior class president, and prom queen while in high school. In 1980 O’Donnell was a prelaw student at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and a year later she studied drama at Boston University. During this time she sporadically toured comedy clubs throughout the United States, and she eventually left college in order to develop her professional stand-up comedy career. After touring in less-than-extravagant circumstances, she finally earned enough as a five-time comedy champion on the television show Star Search to pursue a movie career in Los Angeles.
