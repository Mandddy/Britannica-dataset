Military police,  disciplinary force, composed of soldiers, that exercises police and related functions in armies. Generally, their principal duty is to maintain law and order, prevent and investigate crime within the army, and operate confinement facilities. They also engage in combat as infantry when required.
In the United States, military police constitute a separate branch of the army known as the Military Police Corps. Although it had a long, irregular history dating back to 1776, the corps as a unified, centrally directed organization developed only with the rapid expansion of the army during and after World War II. Its responsibilities extend wherever U.S. troops are stationed. The head of the corps, the provost marshal general, is the chief law-enforcement authority on the staff of the Department of the Army.
