Felix de Andreis, in full Andrew James Felix Bartholomew De Andreis   (born Dec. 13, 1778, Demonte, Piedmont [Italy]â€”died  Oct. 15, 1820, St. Louis, Missouri territory [U.S.]) Vincentian priest and pioneer missionary to the American West.
Ordained at Piacenza (Italy) in 1802, Andreis was transferred (1806) to Rome, where he served as preacher, professor of theology, and apostle to the poor. While on a visit to Rome in 1815, William Du Bourg, the bishop of Louisiana, arranged for Andreis to serve his diocese. Andreis was appointed temporary vicar-general and superior of a band of missionaries who embarked for the American missions. After a long delay at the Seminary of St. Thomas in Kentucky, where he taught theology, Andreis arrived in St. Louis in 1817 and was appointed vicar-general. He was professor and administrator of two colleges, one for seminarians and one for laymen, and supervised the erection of a novitiate at the Barrens, 80 miles (130 km) south of St. Louis. During his lifetime he gained a reputation for sanctity, and several miracles were attributed to his intercession after his death.
