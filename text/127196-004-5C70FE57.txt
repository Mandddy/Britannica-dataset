Kay Ryan,  (born September 27, 1945, San Jose, California, U.S.) American poet laureate (2008–10) who wrote punchy, wry verses about commonplace things with consummate craft, humour, and intelligence.
Ryan grew up in a succession of small towns in California’s Central Valley, where her father worked at a variety of jobs (including oil well driller, chromium miner, and Christmas tree salesman), and her mother was a part-time elementary-school teacher. Ryan enrolled at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, California, but soon transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she earned a B.A. (1967) and an M.A. (1968) in English. She moved to northern California in 1971 and took a part-time job teaching remedial English at the College of Marin in Kentfield, a course she still taught at the beginning of the 21st century. Having written poetry since age 19 but still unsure of her true calling, in 1976 Ryan embarked on a cross-country bicycle trip. While in the Colorado Rockies, it came to her that she could pursue a career as a writer. For the next 20 years she laboured in virtual literary isolation, but she gradually began attracting notice from readers, critics, and the mainstream poetry establishment.
