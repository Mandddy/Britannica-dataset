Luigi Cadorna,  (born Sept. 4, 1850, Pallanza, Piedmont, Kingdom of Sardinia [Italy]—died  Dec. 21, 1928, Bordighera, Italy) general who completely reorganized Italy’s ill-prepared army on the eve of World War I and who was chief of staff during the first 30 months of that conflict.
Cadorna was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Italian army in 1868. Rising through the ranks, he was appointed chief of the Italian general staff in July 1914. When Italy entered World War I by declaring war on Austria-Hungary in May 1915, Cadorna was given command on the Austro-Italian frontier. While maintaining a defensive posture in the Trentino, he mounted a series of offensives along the Isonzo River that incurred heavy casualties and gained little ground. His principal military successes were the blunting of the Austrian offensive in the Trentino (spring 1916), the capture of Gorizia (August 1916), and the victory at Baensezza (1917).
