Anne Donovan,  (born November 1, 1961, Ridgewood, New Jersey, U.S.) American basketball player who is often credited with revolutionizing the centre position in women’s basketball. She later had a successful coaching career.
As a 6-foot 8-inch (2.03-metre) college freshman, Donovan faced high expectations when she entered Old Dominion University (ODU), home of one of the country’s most successful women’s basketball programs, immediately following the conclusion of future Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman’s career. Donovan did not disappoint. She helped the Monarchs to a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) national championship in her first season and went on to establish a storied collegiate career (1979–83), culminating with her selection as national player of the year in 1983. Donovan was a three-time All-American (1981–83), led the country in rebounding in 1982, and set school records in scoring (2,719 points), rebounding (1,976), and blocked shots (801). Her total of 801 blocks is the highest in NCAA history but technically not a record, because the NCAA did not officially keep that statistic until 1987–88.
