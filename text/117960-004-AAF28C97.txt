James River, river in central Virginia, U.S., formed by the junction of the Jackson and Cowpasture rivers and cutting across the Great Appalachian Valley in northern Botetourt county. It flows in an easterly direction, crossing the Blue Ridge Mountains through a series of gorges near Lynchburg and continuing past Richmond, which marks the fall line and head of tidewater, 105 miles (169 km) above its mouth. The river then meanders in a southeasterly direction to enter Hampton Roads through an estuary 5 miles (8 km) wide at Newport News after a course of 340 miles (550 km). As the James River flows through one of the gorges in the Blue Ridge Mountains, it drops in the Balcony Falls and again in a 3-mile (5-km) series of rapids (a total drop of 84 feet [26 metres]) above Richmond, where the river has been impounded by the Boshers Dam. The Appomattox and Chickahominy rivers are the chief tributaries.
The James is navigable for deep drafts to Richmond. A bridge 4.5 miles (7 km) long spans the river above Newport News. Jamestown Island, on the riverâ€™s lower course, was the site of the first permanent English settlement (1607) in America. During the American Civil War, Union troops used the James in their attempt to capture Richmond and dug the Dutch Gap Canal during their siege.
