Agnostus,  genus of trilobites (an extinct group of aquatic arthropods) found as fossils in rocks of Early Cambrian to Late Ordovician age (those deposited from 540 to 438 million years ago). The agnostids were generally small, with only two thoracic segments and a large tail segment. Agnostus itself was only about 6 millimetres (0.25 inch) long and lacked eyes. The similarity of the anterior and posterior regions frequently makes the agnostids difficult to differentiate.
