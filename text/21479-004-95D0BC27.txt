Katherine Augusta Westcott Tingley, née Katherine Augusta Westcott  (born July 6, 1847, Newbury, Mass., U.S.—died July 11, 1929, Visingsö, Swed.) American theosophist, a woman of forceful personality, who introduced charitable works and educational endeavours into the mission of the Theosophical Society in America during her leadership of that group.
Katherine Westcott was educated in public schools and briefly in a convent school in Montreal. In 1888 in New York City she married her third husband, Philo B. Tingley. She was interested in various charitable activities as well as in spiritualism, and in her mission work on the Lower East Side she often attempted to combine the two. In the winter of 1892–93 she met William Quan Judge, who in 1875 had helped Helena Blavatsky form the Theosophical Society.
