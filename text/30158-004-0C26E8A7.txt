James Brindley,  (born 1716, Tunstead, near Buxton, Derbyshire, Eng.—died  Sept. 30, 1772, Turnhurst, Staffordshire) pioneer canal builder, who constructed the first English canal of major economic importance.
Beginning as a millwright, Brindley designed and built an engine for draining coalpits at Clifton, Lancashire, in 1752. In 1759 the Duke of Bridgewater hired him to build a 10-mile (16-kilometre) canal to transport coal from the duke’s mines at Worsley to the textile-manufacturing centre at Manchester. Brindley’s solution to the problem included a subterranean channel, extending from the barge basin at the head of the canal into the mines, and the Barton Aqueduct, which carried the canal over the River Irwell.
