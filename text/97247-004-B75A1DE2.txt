Bono, byname of Paul David Hewson   (born May 10, 1960, Dublin, Ire.) lead singer for the popular Irish rock band U2 and prominent human rights activist.
He was born of a Roman Catholic father and a Protestant mother (who died when he was just age 14). In Dublin in 1977, he and school friends David Evans (later “the Edge”), Larry Mullen, Jr., and Adam Clayton formed a band that would become U2. They shared a commitment not only to ambitious rock music but also to a deeply spiritual Christianity. Indeed, one of the few genuine threats to U2’s extraordinary longevity (a collaboration—with the manager, Paul McGuinness—of more than 30 years) occurred extremely early in the band’s life when three of its members, including Bono, considered joining a Christian fellowship. Throughout U2’s career, religiosity has infused the group’s songwriting and performance.
