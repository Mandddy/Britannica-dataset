John Oxley, in full John Joseph William Molesworth Oxley  (born 1783/85?, near Westow, Yorkshire, England—died May 26, 1828, Kirkham, Australia) surveyor-general and explorer who played an important part in the exploration of eastern Australia and also helped open up Van Diemen’s Land (later Tasmania).
Oxley joined the British navy as a midshipman in 1799 and arrived in Australia as a master’s mate in 1802. He worked on coastal surveys and in 1805 was put in command of the Buffalo by Governor Philip King, and in 1806 he commanded another ship to Van Diemen’s Land. Commissioned a lieutenant in England in 1807, he returned to Sydney (1808) with a land grant of 600 acres (240 hectares), bringing goods as an investment. In 1809 he wrote a report on the settling of Van Diemen’s Land and returned to England.
