Sade, byname of Helen Folasade Adu  (born Jan. 16, 1959, Ibadan, Nigeria) Nigerian-born British singer known for her sophisticated blend of soul, funk, jazz, and Afro-Cuban rhythms.
Adu, who was born to a Nigerian economics professor and an English nurse, was never addressed by people in her community by her English first name, Helen. Her parents began calling her Sade, a shortened form of her Yoruba middle name, Folasade. When she was age four, her parents separated, and she moved with her mother and younger brother to Essex, Eng. At 17 Sade began a three-year program in fashion and design at Central St. Martinâ€™s College of Art and Design in London. After graduating, she modeled and worked as a menswear designer. Her foray into music began when she agreed to fill in temporarily as lead singer for Arriva, a funk band that had been put together by her friends. Sade later sang with another funk band, Pride, before breaking away with fellow Pride members Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and Paul Spencer Denman to form the band that would eventually bear her own name.
