Jacob Pontusson, count de la Gardie,  (born June 20, 1583, Reval, Swedish Estonia [now Tallinn, Estonia]—died August 16, 1652, Stockholm, Sweden) Swedish statesman and soldier who was mainly responsible for introducing advanced Dutch military methods into Sweden. He commanded the Swedish forces in Russia and against Poland and later served as one of the five regents jointly ruling Sweden during the minority of Queen Christina.
From 1606 to 1608 De la Gardie served under the Dutch military leader Maurice of Nassau, prince of Orange, and on his return acquainted the Swedish army with Maurice’s progressive military concepts. Commissioned by King Charles IX to command his country’s forces in Russia (1608–13), De la Gardie captured Moscow (1610) and large areas in northwestern Russia but was disastrously defeated at Klushino in 1610 and failed in his efforts to place Charles IX’s second son, Charles Philip, on the Russian throne. De la Gardie overcame these setbacks as the chief Swedish negotiator in the Peace of Stolbova with Russia (1617). He gained for Sweden a continuous territorial base extending from Finland to Estonia, which protected the Finnish frontier and blocked Russia from access to the Baltic Sea.
