Martin V, original name Oddo, or Oddone, Colonna   (born 1368, Genazzano, Papal States [Italy]—died  Feb. 20, 1431, Rome) pope from 1417 to 1431.
A cardinal subdeacon who had helped organize the Council of Pisa in 1409, he was unanimously elected pope on Nov. 11, 1417, in a conclave held during the Council of Constance (1414–18), which had been called to end the Great Schism (1378–1417), a split in the Western church caused by multiple claimants to the papacy.
