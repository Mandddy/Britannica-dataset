West Sussex, administrative county of southern England, bordering the English Channel. West Sussex lies within the historic county of Sussex, except for a small area in the north around Gatwick Airport, which belongs to the historic county of Surrey. It comprises seven districts: Adur, Arun, Chichester, Horsham, and Mid Sussex and the boroughs of Crawley and Worthing. The administrative centre is Chichester.
A ridge of chalk hills, the South Downs, runs across the county from east to west. The northern slopes of the Downs are abrupt, where the chalk gives way to the heavy clays and sands of The Weald. To the south the Downs slope more gently toward the English Channel. South of Chichester a fertile coastal plain broadens out into the flat headland of Selsey Bill. Coastal erosion, especially around Selsey Bill, has produced continual changes in the shoreline.
