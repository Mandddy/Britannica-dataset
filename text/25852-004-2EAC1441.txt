Edmond Rostand,  (born April 1, 1868, Marseille, France—died  Dec. 2, 1918, Paris) French dramatist of the period just before World War I whose plays provide a final, very belated example of Romantic drama in France.
Rostand’s name is indissolubly linked with that of his most popular and enduring play, Cyrano de Bergerac. First performed in Paris in 1897, with the famous actor Constant Coquelin playing the lead, Cyrano made a great impression in France and all over Europe and the United States. The plot revolves around the emotional problems of Cyrano, who, despite his many gifts, feels that no woman can ever love him because he has an enormous nose. The connection between the Cyrano of the play and the 17th-century nobleman and writer of the same name is purely nominal. But Rostand’s stirring and colourful historical play, with its dazzling versification, skillful blend of comedy and pathos, and fast-moving plot, provided welcome relief from the grim dramas that emerged from the naturalist and Symbolist movements.
