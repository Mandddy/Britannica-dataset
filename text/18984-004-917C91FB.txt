Clara Barton, in full Clarissa Harlowe Barton   (born Dec. 25, 1821, Oxford, Mass., U.S.—died April 12, 1912, Glen Echo, Md.) founder of the American Red Cross.
Barton was educated at home and began teaching at age 15. She attended the Liberal Institute at Clinton, N.Y. (1850–51). In 1852 in Bordentown, N.J., she established a free school that soon became so large that the townsmen would no longer allow a woman to run it. Rather than subordinate herself to a male principal, Barton resigned. She was then employed by the U.S. Patent Office in Washington, D.C., from 1854 to 1857 and again in 1860.
