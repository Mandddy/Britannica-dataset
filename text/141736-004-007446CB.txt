Goiás, town, central Goiás estado (state), central Brazil. It lies on the Vermelho River, a tributary of the Araguaia River. After the explorer Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva discovered gold in the Vermelho in 1682, a settlement called Santa Anna was established on the site of what is now Goiás. The town of Goiás was established in 1727 and flourished during the colonial-era gold rush period. It was the state capital until 1937, when it was superseded by Goiânia, 70 miles (112 km) to the southeast. The town’s historic centre remains intact and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001. Pop. (2010) 24,745.
