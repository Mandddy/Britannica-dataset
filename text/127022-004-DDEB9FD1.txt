Building construction, the techniques and industry involved in the assembly and erection of structures, primarily those used to provide shelter.
Building construction is an ancient human activity. It began with the purely functional need for a controlled environment to moderate the effects of climate. Constructed shelters were one means by which human beings were able to adapt themselves to a wide variety of climates and become a global species.
