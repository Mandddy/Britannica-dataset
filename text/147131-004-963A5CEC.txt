Royal Victorian Order, British order of knighthood instituted by Queen Victoria in 1896 to reward personal services rendered the monarch. As it is a family order, conferment of this honour is solely at the discretion of the British sovereign.
Unlike other British orders, there is no limit on the number of members. During the brief reign of Edward VIII, in 1936, the order’s statutes were amended to admit ladies. This was the first British order to consist of more than three classes, which, listed in descending order, are Knight or Dame Grand Cross (GCVO), Knight or Dame Commander (KCVO or DCVO, respectively), Commander (CVO), Lieutenant (LVO), and Member (MVO). Conferment of the two highest classes entails admission into knighthood if the candidate is not already a knight or dame, and the right to the title of “Sir” or “Dame” as appropriate. (Knights and Dames Grand Cross may be granted the use of supporters with their arms.) Foreigners can be admitted as honorary members.
