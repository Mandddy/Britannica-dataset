Frederick William Faber,  (born June 28, 1814, Calverly, Yorkshire, Eng.â€”died  Sept. 26, 1863, London) British theologian, noted hymnist, and founder of the Wilfridians, a religious society living in common without vows.
Faber was elected fellow of University College, Oxford, in 1837. Originally a Calvinist, he became a disciple of John Henry Newman (later cardinal) and, in 1843, was appointed rector of Elton, Huntingdonshire. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1845 and soon after founded the Wilfridians, a community at Birmingham, Warwickshire, which was merged in the Oratory of St. Philip Neri, with Newman as superior. In 1849 a branch of the community was established in London, over which Faber presided until his death.
