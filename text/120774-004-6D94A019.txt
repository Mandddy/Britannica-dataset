Thresher shark,  (genus Alopias), any of three species of sharks of the family Alopiidae noted for their long, scythelike tails that may constitute almost one-half their total length. Thresher sharks are found in tropical and temperate seas throughout the world. They feed on squid and schooling fishes, attacking after circling and herding their prey into small groups. They sometimes use their tails to stun their prey or, by thrashing the water, to frighten it. They are not generally considered dangerous to man. The best-known species is the long-tailed thresher, or fox shark (A. vulpinus), a big, dark fish that grows about 6 m (20 feet) long and is found in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans. The long-tailed thresher is also a common food fish.
