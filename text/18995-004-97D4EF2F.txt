Charles Carroll,  (born Sept. 19, 1737, Annapolis, Md. [U.S.]—died Nov. 14, 1832, Baltimore, Md., U.S.) American patriot leader, the longest- surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence, and the only Roman Catholic to sign that document.
Until 1765 Carroll attended Jesuit colleges in Maryland and France and studied law in France and England. Before and during the American Revolution, he served on committees of correspondence and in the Continental Congress (1776–78), where he was an important member of the Board of War. In 1776, with Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase, and his cousin, the Rev. John Carroll, he was sent to Canada in a fruitless effort to persuade Canadians to join the cause of the 13 colonies. He was elected again to the Continental Congress in 1780, but he decided not to serve.
