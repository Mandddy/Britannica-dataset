Populations I and II, in astronomy, two broad classes of stars and stellar assemblages defined in the early 1950s by the German-born astronomer Walter Baade. The members of these stellar populations differ from each other in various ways, most notably in age, chemical composition, and location within galactic systems.
Since the 1970s, astronomers have recognized that some stars do not fall easily into either category; these stars have been subclassified as “extreme” Population I or II objects.
