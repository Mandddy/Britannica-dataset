George William Frederick Villiers, 4th earl of Clarendon,  (born Jan. 12, 1800, London—died  June 27, 1870, London) British foreign secretary under four prime ministers at various times from 1853, including the Crimean War period; he was known as “the great Lord Clarendon.”
After serving as a customs commissioner in Dublin and Paris, Villiers was British ambassador to Spain in 1833. Inheriting the earldom of Clarendon in 1838, he returned to England the next year and served as lord privy seal (1839–41) and then as president of the Board of Trade (1846–47). As lord lieutenant (viceroy) of Ireland (1847–52) during the disastrous Irish famine, he resorted to coercive legislation to prevent a general outbreak of violence and sponsored ineffective relief projects. His agrarian reform measures only encouraged English speculation in Irish land.
