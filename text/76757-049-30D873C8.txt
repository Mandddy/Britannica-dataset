Long jump, also called broad jump,  sport in athletics (track-and-field) consisting of a horizontal jump for distance. It was formerly performed from both standing and running starts, as separate events, but the standing long jump is no longer included in major competitions. It was discontinued from the Olympic Games after 1912. The running long jump was an event in the Olympic Games of 708 bce and in the modern Games from 1896.
The standard venue for the long jump includes a runway at least 40 metres (131 feet) in length with no outer limit, a takeoff board planted level with the surface at least 1 metre (3.3 feet) from the end of the runway, and a sand-filled landing area at least 2.75 metres (9 feet) and no more than 3 metres (9.8 feet) wide.
