Gunther Schuller,  (born November 22, 1925, New York, New York, U.S.â€”died June 21, 2015, Boston, Massachusetts) American composer, performer, conductor, teacher, and writer noted for his wide range of activity in both jazz and classical music and for his works embracing both jazz and advanced 12-tone elements.
Schuller was born into a family of musicians. His grandfather was a conductor in Germany, and his father was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic for 41 years. Schuller, whose early education was in specialized music schools, began playing the French horn with the New York Philharmonic at age 15 and became principal hornist at the Cincinnati (Ohio) Symphony (1943) and Metropolitan Opera (1945) orchestras. His interest in jazz developed early when he became a fan of Duke Ellington; he made symphonic adaptations of several Ellington pieces and in 1955 composed Symphonic Tribute to Duke Ellington. He often collaborated with John Lewis, notably with the Modern Jazz Quartet and the Modern Jazz Society.
