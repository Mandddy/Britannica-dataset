Menzies Campbell, Baron Campbell of Pittenweem, also called Ming  (born May 22, 1941, Glasgow, Scotland) Scottish politician who served as leader of the Liberal Democrats (2006–07).
As a young man, Campbell was one of Britain’s top sprinters. He competed in the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo as well as the 1966 Commonwealth Games, and from 1967 until 1974 he held the national 100-metre record. Campbell studied law at the University of Glasgow (M.A., 1962; L.L.B., 1965) and international law at Stanford University (1966–67). He was called to the bar in 1968 and advanced to queen’s counsel in 1982. While a student, he became friends with the future national Labour Party leader John Smith as well as Donald Dewar, who in 1999 became first minister of Scotland, following the establishment of Scotland’s first Parliament in almost 300 years. Unlike Smith and Dewar, Campbell joined the Scottish Liberal Party, rising to become chairman in 1975 at age 34. After three unsuccessful bids for Parliament, in 1987 he was elected MP for North East Fife, north of Edinburgh, and in 1988 the Liberal Party merged with the Social Democratic Party to become the Liberal Democrats.
