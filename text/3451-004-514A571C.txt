Luciano Laurana,  (born c. 1420, Zadar, Dalmatia [now in Croatia]—died  1479, Pesaro, Papal States [Italy]) principal designer of the Palazzo Ducale at Urbino and one of the main figures in 15th-century Italian architecture.
Nothing is known of Laurana’s training. Because the triumphal arch of Alfonso of Aragon in Naples has much in common with Laurana’s later works at Urbino, some speculate that he may have begun his career in Naples. He is known to have been at Mantua in 1465, when Leon Battista Alberti was directing the construction of the Church of San Sebastiano.
