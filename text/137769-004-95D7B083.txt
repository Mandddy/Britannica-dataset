SATA, in full serial advanced technology attachment, also called serial ATA ,  an interface for transferring data between a computerâ€™s central circuit board and storage devices. SATA was designed to replace the long-standing PATA (parallel ATA) interface.
Serial communication transfers data one bit at a time, rather than in several parallel streams. Despite the apparent advantage of the parallel model, in practice serial transmission is less susceptible to interference, allowing SATA to operate at significantly higher speeds than PATA. The serial model also allows for simpler and slimmer cabling.
