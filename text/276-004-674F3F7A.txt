Electromagnetic spectrum, the entire distribution of electromagnetic radiation according to frequency or wavelength. All electromagnetic waves travel with the same velocity in a vacuumâ€”at the speed of light, which is 299,792,458 metres, or about 186,282 miles, per second. However, the entire distribution covers a wide range of frequencies and wavelengths, and it consists of many subranges, commonly referred to as portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The various portions bear different names based on differences in behaviour in the emission, transmission, and absorption of the corresponding waves and also based on their different practical applications. There are no precise accepted boundaries between any of these contiguous portions, so the ranges tend to overlap.
The entire electromagnetic spectrum, from the lowest to the highest frequency (longest to shortest wavelength), includes all radio waves (e.g., commercial radio and television, microwaves, radar), infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.
