Dame’s rocket (Hesperis matronalis), also called dame’s violet,  herbaceous plant of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Native to Eurasia, dame’s rocket is often cultivated as an ornamental and has naturalized in North America, where it is now considered an invasive species. The plant is a biennial or short-lived perennial and reaches about 90 cm (3 feet) in height. It has narrow, toothed leaves. The four-petaled flowers are borne in loose clusters and have a violet-like fragrance. They are often distinctly veined and are usually lilac, purple, or sometimes white in colour. Dame’s rocket readily reseeds itself. Each plant is capable of producing hundreds of seeds borne in narrow fruits known as siliques.
