Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O), first steam-operated railway in the United States to be chartered as a common carrier of freight and passengers (1827). The B&amp;O Railroad Company was established by Baltimore (Md.) merchants to compete with New York merchants and their newly opened Erie Canal for the trade to the west. A driving force in its early years was the Baltimore banker George Brown, who served as treasurer from 1827 until 1834 and had Ross Winans build the first real railroad car.
The first stone for the line was laid on July 4, 1828, by Charles Carroll, the American Revolutionary leader and last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. The first 13 miles (21 km) of line, from Baltimore to Ellicott’s Mills, Md. (now Ellicott City), opened in 1830. Peter Cooper’s steam locomotive, the Tom Thumb, ran over this line and demonstrated to doubters that steam traction was feasible on the steep, winding grades.
