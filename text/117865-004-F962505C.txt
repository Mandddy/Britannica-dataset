University of Minnesota, state university system in Minnesota consisting of four coeducational campuses. The main branch, the Twin Cities campus, occupies both banks of the Mississippi River at Minneapolis and St. Paul. There are also campuses in Duluth, Morris, Crookston, and Rochester.
The founding of the University of Minnesota as a preparatory school in 1851 predates the creation of the state itself in 1858. Students (both male and female) were taught on a sporadic basis until the closing of the school during the American Civil War. The school received land-grant status following the Morrill Act of 1862, reopened in 1867, and reorganized as a university in 1869. Medicine and law were taught from 1888. In 1915 brothers William James and Charles Horace Mayo (see Mayo family) helped establish the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research at Rochester as part of the University of Minnesota Graduate School. The Duluth campus was founded as a normal (teacher-training) school in 1895 and joined the university system in 1947; its medical school opened in 1972. The campus at Morris originated in 1887 as a boarding school for Native Americans and later became an agricultural school; it joined the state university system in 1960. The Crookston campus, founded as a residential agricultural high school in 1905, joined the system in 1966. The Rochester campus became a satellite site of the university in 1966 but did not formally join the system until 2006.
