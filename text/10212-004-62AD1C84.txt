Loganberry (Rubus loganobaccus), species of bramble of the rose family (Rosaceae) that originated in Santa Cruz, California, in 1881. Raised from seed by James Harvey Logan, a lawyer and amateur horticulturist, the plant is thought to be a hybrid between the wild blackberry (Rubus ursinus) of the Pacific coast and the red raspberry (Rubus idaeus), a cosmopolitan species. It is grown in large quantities in Oregon and Washington and is also cultivated in England and Australia, among other places. The fruit is canned, frozen for preserve or pie stock, or made into wine.
The loganberry is a vigorous, nearly trailing plant with compound leaves of three to five leaflets and prickly canes. Its deep wine-red, tart, high-flavoured fruit is technically an aggregate of druplets and is hollow like a blackberry. Although the plants are hardy and fairly resistent to disease and frost, commercial production is limited, because the harvest is considered labour-intensive and the fruits have a short shelf-life. Hybrids without prickles have been developed.
