Sir Michael Redgrave, in full Sir Michael Scudamore Redgrave  (born March 20, 1908, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England—died March 21, 1985, Denham, Buckinghamshire) premier British stage and film actor, noted for his intellectual performances.
Following a short tenure as a schoolmaster, Redgrave began his stage career in 1934 with the Liverpool Playhouse. He went on to the Old Vic, Stratford-upon-Avon, and the National Theatre, establishing himself as a leading Shakespearean actor with his intense performances of Hamlet, Lear, and Macbeth, among others. He also played classic roles from the works of Ibsen and Chekhov, as well as starring in such modern works as Family Reunion (1939) and Tiger at the Gates (1955). Redgrave used his refined good looks and resonant, expressive voice to good effect in his highly cerebral, technically perfect interpretations of introverted or reserved characters on both stage and screen. His film career began in 1938 with Hitchcock’s The Lady Vanishes and continued with roles in Dead of Night (1945) and The Browning Version (1951). One of Redgrave’s most highly acclaimed roles was as Orin Mannon in Eugene O’Neill’s Mourning Becomes Electra (1947). Other of his films include The Importance of Being Earnest (1952), Goodbye Mr. Chips (1969), and Nicholas and Alexandra (1971). Redgrave, who originally wanted to be a writer, was the author of plays, theoretical works about the acting profession, an autobiography, In My Mind’s Eye (also published as In My Mind’s I, 1983), and a novel, The Mountebank’s Tale (1959). He also directed several plays and operas, and he was knighted in 1959 for his services to the theatre.
