Electronic role-playing game, electronic game genre in which players advance through a story quest, and often many side quests, for which their character or party of characters gain experience that improves various attributes and abilities. The genre is almost entirely rooted in TSR, Inc.’s Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D; 1974), a role-playing game (RPG) for small groups in which each player takes some role, such as a healer, warrior, or wizard, to help his party battle evil as directed by the group’s Dungeon Master, or assigned storyteller. While fantasy settings remain popular, electronic RPGs have also explored the realms of science fiction and the cloak-and-dagger world of espionage.
Early electronic RPG games generally kept some or all of the original aspects of D&amp;D, including its fantasy world of elves, dwarfs, trolls, goblins, and dragons and its character attributes—constitution, strength, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. The first effort to produce an electronic version of D&amp;D was Dungeon (1975), which was an unauthorized adaptation for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-10 minicomputer. Although basically a text-based implementation, it included overhead maps of the dungeon that showed where players had explored.
