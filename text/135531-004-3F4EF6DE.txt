Talat Paşa,  in full Mehmed Talat Paşa  (born 1874, Edirne, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died March 15, 1921, Berlin, Ger.) leader of the Young Turks, Ottoman statesman, grand vizier (1917–18), and leading member of the Ottoman government from 1913 to 1918.
The son of a minor Ottoman official, Talat joined the staff of the telegraph company in Edirne, but he was soon arrested (1893) for subversive political activity. Released two years later, he was appointed chief secretary of posts and telegraphs in Salonika (modern Thessaloníki, Greece) and rendered important services to the Young Turk cause. In 1908 he was dismissed for being a member of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the conspiratorial nucleus of the Young Turk movement. After the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, however, he became deputy for Edirne in the Ottoman Parliament, and in 1909 he was appointed minister of the interior. He became minister of post and then the secretary-general of the CUP (1912).
