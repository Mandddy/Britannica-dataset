Sebastian Vettel,  (born July 3, 1987, Heppenheim, West Germany [now in Germany]) German race-car driver who in 2010, at age 23, became the youngest Formula One (F1) Grand Prix champion in the sport’s history.
Vettel grew up idolizing German racing icon Michael Schumacher, and he took up karting in 1995. He proved to have great talent and soon drew the attention of Gerhard Noack, a track owner who had shepherded Schumacher through his own youth-karting career. Noack’s support (as well as that of Red Bull Racing, which sponsored Vettel’s karting career from age 12) helped Vettel win numerous karting titles before he switched to open-wheel racing in 2003. Vettel finished second in the overall standings in his first season of driving in the junior Formula BMW series and won the series championship handily in 2004, posting 18 victories in his 20 races. He subsequently moved to the Formula Three Euro Series (placing second in 2006) and the World Series by Renault before making his Formula One race debut in 2007 after having served as an F1 test driver for two seasons.
