Perpetual calendar, type of dating system that makes it possible to find the correct day of the week for any date over a wide range of years. Aspects of the perpetual calendar can be found in the Jewish calendar and the Julian calendar, and some form of it has appeared in proposed calendar reforms. The 19th-century French philosopher Auguste Comte, for example, proposed a calendar of 13 months of 28 days each, with an extra day (Year Day) inserted between December 28 and January 1 each year and with an additional leap-year day periodically. More recently, reformers promoted the World Calendar, consisting of 12 months divided into 30 and 31 days, with an annual “year-end” day and a periodic leap-year day.
To find the day of the week for any Gregorian or Julian date in the perpetual calendar provided in the table, first find the proper dominical letter (one of the letters A through G) for the year in the upper table. Leap years have two dominical letters, the first applicable to dates in January and February, the second to dates in the remaining months. Then find the same dominical letter in the lower table, in whichever column it appears opposite the month in question. The days then fall as given in the lowest section of the column.              month dominical letter   January, October A B C D E F G   February, March, November D E F G A B C   April, July G A B C D E F   May B C D E F G A   June E F G A B C D   August C D E F G A B   September, December F G A B C D E   1 8 15 22 29 Sunday Saturday Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday Monday   2 9 16 23 30 Monday Sunday Saturday Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday   3 10 17 24 31 Tuesday Monday Sunday Saturday Friday Thursday Wednesday   4 11 18 25 Wednesday Tuesday Monday Sunday Saturday Friday Thursday   5 12 19 26 Thursday Wednesday Tuesday Monday Sunday Saturday Friday   6 13 20 27 Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday Monday Sunday Saturday   7 14 21 28 Saturday Friday Thursday Wednesday Tuesday Monday Sunday   *On and before 1582, October 4 only. **On and after 1582, October 15 only.
