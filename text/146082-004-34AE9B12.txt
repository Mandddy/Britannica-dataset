Pecos River,  river in the southwestern United States, rising in Mora County, north-central New Mexico, in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and flowing about 926 miles (1,490 km) through eastern New Mexico and western Texas. It drains about 38,300 square miles (99,200 square km) before emptying into the Rio Grande at the Amistad National Recreation Area. After leaving the mountains, the Pecos flows over desertlike land, and its channel is dry much of the year. Near Roswell, N.M., the river widens into a basin, which closes somewhat to a broad, shallow valley at the Texasâ€“New Mexico border. In the last 125 miles (201 km) of its course, the river has cut a narrow canyon more than 1,000 feet (300 m) deep. Dams controlling the river and providing water for irrigation include: Alamogordo Dam (1937), Avalon Dam (1907), McMillan Dam (1908), part of the Carlsbad Reclamation Project, and Red Bluff Dam (1936). Santa Rosa, Fort Sumner, Roswell, and Carlsbad, N.M., and Pecos, Texas, are important towns on or near the river.
