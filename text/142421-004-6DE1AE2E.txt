Pressed glass,  glassware produced by mechanically pressing molten glass into a plain or engraved mold by means of a plunger. Pressed glass can generally be distinguished from hand-cut glass because of its blunt-edged facets, mold seams (which are often removed by polishing, however), and precise, regular faceting.
Glass was cast in open molds by the Egyptians as early as 5 bc, but it was not until the 19th century that glassmakers learned how to shape glass by pressing. The use of a plunger enabled glassmakers to spread the thick, molten glass quickly throughout the mold before it solidified and thereby made it possible for them to shape the glass into intricate forms with elaborate designs. The first commercial glass-pressing machine was developed in 1825 by John P. Bakewell of the United States. The invention of this device quickly led to the mass production of glassware and greatly reduced its cost. The pressing process became the single most important factor in making glassware affordable for everyday use.
