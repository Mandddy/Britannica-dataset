Königsberg bridge problem, a recreational mathematical puzzle, set in the old Prussian city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), that led to the development of the branches of mathematics known as topology and graph theory. In the early 18th century, the citizens of Königsberg spent their days walking on the intricate arrangement of bridges across the waters of the Pregel (Pregolya) River, which surrounded two central landmasses connected by a bridge (3). Additionally, the first landmass (an island) was connected by two bridges (5 and 6) to the lower bank of the Pregel and also by two bridges (1 and 2) to the upper bank, while the other landmass (which split the Pregel into two branches) was connected to the lower bank by one bridge (7) and to the upper bank by one bridge (4), for a total of seven bridges. According to folklore, the question arose of whether a citizen could take a walk through the town in such a way that each bridge would be crossed exactly once.
In 1735 the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler presented a solution to this problem, concluding that such a walk was impossible. To confirm this, suppose that such a walk is possible. In a single encounter with a specific landmass, other than the initial or terminal one, two different bridges must be accounted for: one for entering the landmass and one for leaving it. Thus, each such landmass must serve as an endpoint of a number of bridges equaling twice the number of times it is encountered during the walk. Therefore, each landmass, with the possible exception of the initial and terminal ones if they are not identical, must serve as an endpoint of an even number of bridges. However, for the landmasses of Königsberg, A is an endpoint of five bridges, and B, C, and D are endpoints of three bridges. The walk is therefore impossible.
