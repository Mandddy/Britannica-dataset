Blister beetle (family Meloidae), any of approximately 2,500 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) that secrete an irritating substance, cantharidin, which is collected mainly from Mylabris and the European species Lytta vesicatoria, commonly called Spanish fly. Cantharidin is used medically as a topical skin irritant to remove warts. In the past, when inducing blisters was a common remedy for many ailments, cantharidin was commonly used for this purpose. It was also a major ingredient in so-called love potions. Blister beetles are both helpful and harmful to humans. The larvae eat grasshopper eggs, and, if abundant, adults can destroy crops.
Adult blister beetles are often brightly coloured, the need for camouflage being eliminated by their ability to secrete cantharidin. They range between 3 and 20 mm (0.1 to 0.8 inch) in length, with the majority between 10 and 15 mm (0.4 and 0.6 inch). Their long, slender, leathery bodies are covered by metallic green or blue wing covers, often marked with bands or stripes.
