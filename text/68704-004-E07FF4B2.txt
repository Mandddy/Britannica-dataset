Clément Ader,  (born Feb. 4, 1841, Muret, France—died March 5, 1926, Toulouse) self-taught French engineer, inventor, and aeronautical pioneer.
Ader constructed a balloon at his own expense in 1870. By 1873 he had turned his attention to heavier-than-air flight, constructing a winged “bird” on which he is said to have made tethered flights. Ader resigned his position with the Administration of Bridges and Roads in 1876, determined to make a fortune and pursue the dream of mechanical flight. He built his early reputation as a pioneer of telephony and an inventor of communications devices, which ranged from a microphone to a public address system.
