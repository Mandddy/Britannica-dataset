Mary J. Blige , in full Mary Jane Blige  (born January 11, 1971, Bronx, New York, U.S.) American singer-songwriter who has been called the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul.
Blige’s childhood was divided between Savannah, Georgia, and a housing project in Yonkers, New York. Her early musical influences included singing in a Pentecostal church and listening to her mother’s collection of soul records. When a recording of the 17-year-old Blige singing Anita Baker’s “Caught Up in the Rapture” (made in a karaoke booth in a local shopping mall) came to the attention of Uptown Records in 1988, the rhythm-and-blues label put Blige, who had dropped out of high school, under contract. She sang backup for various artists until the 1992 release of her first solo album, What’s the 411?, produced primarily by rapper Sean “Puffy” Combs (Diddy).
