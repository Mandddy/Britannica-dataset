Koishikawa Botanical Garden, Japanese Koishikawa Shokubutsuen,  botanical garden and arboretum maintained by the University of Tokyo. It has some 4,000 different plant species under cultivation on its 40-acre (16-hectare) site in Tokyo. Among its most notable outdoor collections are camellias, cherries, maples, Japanese primroses, bonsai trees, and alpine plants. A major feature of the garden is the arboretum, which abounds in coniferous and broad-leaved tree species from East Asia as well as in many exotic varieties from other regions of the world. It also maintains the University of Tokyo’s large herbarium (much of it now housed in the university museum), consisting of about 1.7 million dried reference specimens. Established in 1684 by the Tokugawa shogunate to grow medicinal herbs, the garden was reorganized into its present form in 1873 and was taken over by the university’s faculty of science four years later.
Koishikawa Botanical Garden has a branch garden, 26 acres (10.5 hectares) in size, in Nikko, Tochigi prefecture. The Nikko garden, established in 1902 and moved to its present location in 1911, specializes in alpine plants but also has excellent collections of Japanese species and such varieties as cherries and rhododendrons.
