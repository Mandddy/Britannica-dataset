George Buchanan,  (born February 1506, Killearn, Stirlingshire, Scot.—died  Sept. 29, 1582, Edinburgh) Scottish Humanist, educator, and man of letters, who was an eloquent critic of corruption and inefficiency in church and state during the period of the Reformation in Scotland. He was also known throughout Europe as a scholar and a Latin poet.
After attending the University of Paris and the University of St. Andrews, Buchanan became a teacher in the Collège de Sainte-Barbe in Paris. There he taught Latin according to the new method of Thomas Linacre, whose book in English on Latin grammar he translated into Latin (1533). Because of Buchanan’s two bitter attacks on the Franciscans—Somnium (1535) and Franciscanus et fratres (1527)—he was jailed as a heretic. He escaped and accepted a position as teacher at the Collège de Guyenne in Bordeaux, Fr. There Montaigne was one of his pupils. Buchanan found diversion in translating Euripides’ Medea and Alcestis into Latin and in writing original dramas—e.g., Baptistes (1534) and Jepthes (1578)—attacking tyranny.
