Stag beetle (family Lucanidae), also called pinching bug,  any of some 900 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) in which the mandibles (jaws) are greatly developed in the male and resemble the antlers of a stag. In many species the elaborately branched and toothed mandibles may be as long as the beetle itself. If handled carelessly, their pinch can draw blood from a person. In some cases, however, the mandibles are large enough to be a handicap to the beetleâ€™s movement.
Most stag beetles are robust and black or brown. However, a few are brightly coloured. Paintings of Chaisognathus granti from Chile, which is metallic green and iridescent red, and Phalacrognathus muelleri from Australia, which is metallic carmine and edged with green, have been used on postage stamps.
