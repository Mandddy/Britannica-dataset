Akal Takht, (
        Punjabi: “Throne of the Timeless One”) the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism. It is located in the city of Amritsar in Punjab state, northwestern India. Similar seats of authority (takhts) are located at Anandpur and Talwando Sabo (near Bathinda) in Punjab, Patna in Bihar state, and Nanded in Maharashtra state.
The Akal Takht is part of the complex of religious buildings centred on the Harmandir Sahib, or Golden Temple, the principal Sikh house of worship. It is situated just beyond a large gateway at the entrance to the causeway across the tank (pool) that leads to the Golden Temple. The building was badly damaged during the assault on the Golden Temple by the Indian army in June 1984. It was subsequently rebuilt.
