Black Eyed Peas, American musical group with a multiracial lineup and an eclectic range of styles encompassing hip-hop, dance, and pop. The Black Eyed Peas originated in the underground hip-hop movement of the 1990s. After the dissolution of their group Atban Klann, rappers will.i.am (byname of William James Adams, Jr.; b. March 15, 1975, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.) and apl.de.ap (byname of Allan Pineda Lindo; b. Nov. 28, 1974, Angeles City, Pampanga, Phil.) recruited MC and dancer Taboo (byname of Jaime Luis Gomez; b. July 14, 1975, East Los Angeles, Calif.) to form the Black Eyed Peas. The group’s debut recording, Behind the Front (1998), gained attention for its positive socially conscious lyrics and musical dexterity.
Bridging the Gap (2000), boasting guest appearances by hip-hop performers Mos Def, De La Soul, and Wyclef Jean, continued in a similar vein. With the addition of vocalist Fergie (byname of Stacy Ann Ferguson; b. March 27, 1975, Hacienda Heights, Calif.) in 2001, however, the group abandoned the hip-hop underground for the pop mainstream. Elephunk (2003) yielded the upbeat club-friendly hit singles “Where Is the Love?” (a collaboration with Justin Timberlake), “Hey Mama,” and “Let’s Get It Started” (titled “Let’s Get Retarded” on the album) and went on to sell more than two million copies. Its follow-up, Monkey Business (2005), featuring the exuberant top-five hits “Don’t Phunk with My Heart” and “My Humps,” was even more commercially successful.
