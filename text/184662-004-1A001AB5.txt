Laurel,  any of several evergreen shrubs and small trees of the genus Laurus within the family Lauraceae; the name is chiefly applied to L. nobilis (also called bay, sweet bay, bay laurel, and bay tree), native to the Mediterranean region but now widely cultivated in other regions of the world. The plant is the source of bay leaf, a cooking herb. In ancient Greece the wreath of honour placed upon the heads of heroes was made from the leaves and branches of laurel.
Laurus nobilis grows 6–18 m (20–60 feet) tall. The stiff, alternate, oval leaves are dull and leathery and about 7.5–10 cm (3–4 inches) long; the leaf edges are smooth and often wavy. The small and inconspicuous flowers are yellowish or greenish white. The fruit, a green, purple, or blackish berry, contains one seed.
