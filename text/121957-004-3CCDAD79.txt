Rio de Janeiro, estado (state) of southeastern Brazil, bounded by the states of Espírito Santo (north), Minas Gerais (west), and São Paulo (southwest), while to the east lies the Atlantic Ocean. It is named for the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state capital, which was the capital of Brazil from 1763 to 1960 and remains the nation’s main centre for cultural events, leisure, and tourism. It is Brazil’s second largest urban centre (after São Paulo city), and it accounts for the bulk of the population of the highly urbanized state. Area 16,871 square miles (43,696 square km). Pop. (2010) 15,989,929.
The state’s relief has three distinct features: the plain, or coastal lowland; the mountainous highland; and the plateau of the interior. The coastal lowland—which is broken by occasional massifs or rocks that sometimes extend far into the sea—is narrower to the west, where the Serra do Mar compresses it against the sea. The mountainous highland comprises part of the Serra do Mar and, farther inland, part of the Serra da Mantiqueira, both of which run parallel to the coast in a roughly southwest-to-northeast direction. Some important tourist and holiday resorts—Petrópolis, Teresópolis, and Nova Friburgo—lie in this region. At 9,144 feet (2,787 metres) Agulhas Negras (Itatiaia) Peak is the highest point in the state.
