Iowa, also called Ioway,  North American Indian people of Siouan linguistic stock who migrated southwestward from north of the Great Lakes to the general area of what is now the state of Iowa, U.S., before European settlement of the so-called New World. The Iowa are related to the Oto and the Missouri.
Living at the transition point between the territories of the Northeast Indians and the Plains Indians, the Iowa had a traditional tribal economy that combined hunting with agriculture. The people were semisedentary, living in villages, raising corn (maize) and other crops, and later trading pelts for European manufactured goods. Iowa houses were domed structures, and the people used tepees when hunting or engaging in other mobile activities. Like the Osage and the Kansa, Iowa warriors wore their hair in a scalp lock decorated with deer hair. They recognized three grades of battle exploits: participating in a victorious skirmish, killing an enemy, and decapitating an enemy.
