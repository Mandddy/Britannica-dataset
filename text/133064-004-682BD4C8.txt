Ner tamid,  (Hebrew: “eternal light”), lamp that burns perpetually in Jewish synagogues before or near the ark of the Law (aron ha-qodesh). It reminds the congregation of the holiness of the Torah scrolls that are stored within the ark and calls to mind God’s abiding presence and his providential care of the Jewish people. The ner tamid also represents the light that burned continuously in the western section of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem.
