Antonia Novello, née Antonia Coello  (born August 23, 1944, Fajardo, Puerto Rico) Puerto Rican-born physician and public official, the first woman and the first Hispanic to serve as surgeon general of the United States (1990–93).
Antonia Coello suffered from a painful colon condition from birth until she underwent corrective surgery at age 18. This experience influenced her to train as a physician in order to help minimize suffering in others. After completing both her undergraduate work (1965) and her medical training (1970) at the University of Puerto Rico, she married Joseph R. Novello, then a navy flight surgeon and later a psychiatrist, author, and medical journalist. The couple moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she did her internship and residency in pediatrics, followed by a fellowship in pediatric nephrology, at the University of Michigan Medical Center. She then completed a fellowship at Georgetown University Hospital in 1974–75 (and later joined the teaching staff) and earned a master’s degree in public health from Johns Hopkins University in 1982.
