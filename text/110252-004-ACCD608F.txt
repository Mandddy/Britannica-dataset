American Folk Art Museum, art museum in Manhattan, New York, U.S., dedicated to the collection and exhibition of American folk and outsider art.
Since its first incarnation in 1963—when it was known as the Museum of Early American Folk Arts—the museum has focused on collecting and displaying important works in a variety of media created by self-taught American artists and artisans. This it carried out to critical acclaim under difficult circumstances and at changing venues. It was renamed the Museum of American Folk Art in 1966 and the American Folk Art Museum in 2001, when it moved to a new purpose-built location. From 2001 to 2011 the museum occupied that facility, but the building later was sold and the collection returned to the location it had occupied in 1989–2001.
