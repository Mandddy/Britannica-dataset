Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Fadeyev,  Fadeyev also spelled Fadeev   (born Dec. 11 [Dec. 24, New Style], 1901, Kimry, near Tver, Russia—died  May 13, 1956, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian novelist who was a leading exponent and theoretician of proletarian literature and a high Communist Party functionary influential in literary politics.
Fadeyev passed his youth in the Ural Mountains and in eastern Siberia, receiving his schooling in Vladivostok. He joined the Communist Party in 1918 and fought in Siberia against both the White armies and the Japanese. Drawing on this experience he wrote his first important novel, Razgrom (1927; The Nineteen), which deals with a ragged band of 19 Red guerrilla fighters trapped between the Whites and the Japanese. Each of the 19 characters is treated in the round. Especially notable is the portrait of their leader, the positive hero Levinson, a disciplined communist who conceals his own fears and weaknesses and leads his unlikely army to a successful escape. Siberia also is the setting of the long, unfinished multivolume novel Posledny iz Udege (1929–41; “The Last of the Udege”).
