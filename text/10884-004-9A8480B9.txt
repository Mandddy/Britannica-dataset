Human louse (Pediculus humanus), also called body louse,  a common species of sucking louse in the family Pediculidae (suborder Anoplura, order Phthiraptera; see sucking louse) that is found wherever human beings live, feeds on blood, and can be an important carrier of epidemic typhus and other louse-borne human diseases such as trench fever and relapsing fever. There are two subspecies, Pediculus humanus capitis, the head louse, and P. humanus humanus, the body louse, or cootie.
Smaller and tougher than the body louse, the head louse attaches itself to the hair or scalp by means of claws on its legs. Young lice are sometimes called red backs because of their blood-red colour after feeding. They are called black backs, or gray backs, after digestion has taken place. Head lice pass from host to host by direct contact. The easiest way to get rid of them is to keep the hair and scalp clean and to use a fine-tooth comb frequently. In earlier times, when hygiene was not commonly practiced, heads were shaved and wigs worn in an effort to get rid of head lice.
