Hot rod,  privately designed and built automobile constructed along individualistic lines to provide maximum starting acceleration; it is most popular in the United States. Hot-rod competition is largely confined to acceleration contests (see drag racing), but hot rods may also compete in various classes against time or distance in speed and endurance attempts. Many national and international records, some previously held by large manufacturers, fell to hot-rod builders and drivers in the period following World War II. A wide range of automobiles may be called hot rods, and no definition of the term is universally accepted. The cars may be constructed of components from many makes of old or new automobiles. Many are intended primarily for exhibition rather than for racing or everyday driving.
