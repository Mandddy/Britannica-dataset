Ernesto Sábato, in full Ernesto Roque Sábato  (born June 24, 1911, Rojas, Argentina—died April 30, 2011, Buenos Aires) Argentine novelist, journalist, and essayist whose novels are notable for their concern with philosophical and psychological issues and whose political and social studies were highly influential in Argentina in the latter half of the 20th century.
Educated as a physicist and mathematician, Sábato attended the National University of La Plata (1929–36), where he received a doctorate in physics in 1937. He did postdoctoral work at the Curie Laboratory in Paris in 1938 and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1939 and returned to Argentina in 1940. From 1940 to 1945 he taught theoretical physics at the National University of La Plata and at a teachers college in Buenos Aires. He began to contribute to the literary section of La Nación, one of Argentina’s leading newspapers, articles that stated his opposition to the Juan Perón government, and as a result he was removed from his teaching posts in 1945.
