Claribel Alegría,  (born May 12, 1924, Estelí. Nicaragua) poet, essayist, and journalist who was a major voice in the literature of contemporary Central America. Noted for her testimonio (testament) concerning the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, she was best known in the United States for the bilingual edition of her volume of poetry, Flores del volcán/Flowers from the Volcano (1982), translated by the poet Carolyn Forché.
Alegría spent her childhood in exile in El Salvador and considered herself Salvadoran. A graduate of George Washington University (B.A., 1948), she lived in the United States, Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay and on the island of Majorca, Spain, before returning to Nicaragua in 1979. She collaborated with her husband, writer Darwin Flakoll, on such works as Nuevas voces de Norteamérica (1962; New Voices of Hispanic America; coeditor and cotranslator), Cenizas de Izalco (1966; Ashes of Izalco; coauthor), and No me agarran viva (1983; They Won’t Take Me Alive; coauthor).
