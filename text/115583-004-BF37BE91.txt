Hedin Brú, original name Hans Jakob Jacobsen  (born Aug. 17, 1901, Ska̡levig, Faroe Islands, Den.—died May 18, 1987, Tórshavn, Faroe Islands) Faroese writer who helped to establish Faroese as a literary language.
At the age of 14 Brú worked as a fisherman. He spent much of the 1920s studying agriculture in Denmark, and from 1928 he was an agricultural adviser to the Faroese government. His first two novels, Longbrá (1930; “Mirage”) and Fastatøkur (1937; “Firm Grip”), dramatize the changing face of Faroese life as subsistence agriculture gave way to the fishing industry. A similar contrast between old and new is the main theme of his best work, Fedgar á ferd (1940; The Old Man and His Sons). Brú played a central role in cultural life as coeditor of the literary periodical Vardin and as a member of the Faroese Scientific Society and began to acquire an international reputation. He also produced Faroese translations of Hamlet and The Tempest and wrote a volume of memoirs.
