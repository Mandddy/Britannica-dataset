Fondant, confection of sugar, syrup, and water, and sometimes milk, cream, or butter, that is cooked and beaten so as to render the sugar crystals imperceptible to the tongue. The candy is characteristically glossy white in colour, velvety in texture, and plastic in consistency.
Usually, as a first step in making fondant, sugar, corn syrup, and invert sugar, or sugar broken down by heat and graining retardants, are dissolved in water. The resulting mass is heated and beaten or agitated vigorously to dissolve the sugar further.
