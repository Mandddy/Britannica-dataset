What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, American psychological thriller film, released in 1962, that was a late-career triumph for both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.
Baby Jane Hudson (played by Davis) is a former child star of the vaudeville era whose fame was so widespread that there was even a “Baby Jane” doll made in her likeness. Her older sister, Blanche (Crawford), watched with envy as their father doted on Jane and spoiled her with toys and attention. Years later, in the 1930s, both sisters are actresses—but the roles have switched. Blanche is now the more successful of the two sisters, which has left Jane bitter and jealous. After a suspicious automobile accident leaves Blanche confined to a wheelchair, Jane spends her subsequent years giving reluctant care to her disabled sister. As Jane descends into madness, Blanche becomes her prisoner and is subject to various psychological tortures.
