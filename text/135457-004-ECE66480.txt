Pyotr Andreyevich, Count Shuvalov,  (born June 15 [June 27, New Style], 1827, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  March 10 [March 22], 1889, St. Petersburg) diplomat and political-police director who became one of Alexander II’s advisers and used his extensive power to oppose the enactment of liberal reforms in Russia.
Having entered the Russian army in 1845, Shuvalov served in the Crimean War (1853–56) and began his diplomatic career as a member of the Russian delegation to the Paris peace conference of 1856. The following year he was put in charge of the St. Petersburg police. His success there brought him the post of director of political police in the Ministry of the Interior (1860–61). There he became known as an opponent of the emancipation of the serfs. In 1866 he became chief of staff of the gendarmerie corps and head of the political police, or “3rd section” of the imperial chancery. While serving in this capacity he became a close adviser to Alexander II and used his influence to retard the carrying out of existing reforms and to appoint persons of reactionary views to important positions. Sent to London on a special diplomatic mission in 1873, Shuvalov was appointed ambassador to London in 1874 and served there effectively until 1879, when, because of his involvement in Russia’s diplomatic failure following the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), he was recalled and forced to retire.
