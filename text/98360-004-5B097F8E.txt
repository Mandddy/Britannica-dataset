Jackie McLean, byname of John Lenwood McLean, Jr.  (born May 17, 1931, New York City, New York, U.S.—died March 31, 2006, Hartford, Connecticut) African American jazz musician noted for the emotional intensity of his alto saxophone improvising.
From a musical family, McLean became known as a fine altoist in his teens and first recorded in 1951, with Miles Davis, playing “Dig” (also called “Donna”), a McLean theme song that became a jazz standard. McLean played in Charles Mingus’s and Art Blakey’s groups, then won acclaim for his playing and his acting when he appeared with the Freddie Redd Quartet in the Off-Broadway hit The Connection (1959–60). Narcotics addiction interrupted his early career, but in the mid-1960s he toured internationally and then became a music teacher and drug counselor. In 1970 McLean joined the Hartt School of Music (now Hartt School) at the University of Hartford. He helped found the school’s department of African American music in 1980 and served as its first director; the department was renamed the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz in 2000. In addition to teaching, he toured and recorded occasionally.
