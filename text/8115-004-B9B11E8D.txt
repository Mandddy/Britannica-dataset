Bloodhound, also called St. Hubert hound,  breed of dog unsurpassed by any other in scenting ability and from which most of the scent-hunting hounds have been derived. It was known, although not in its present form, in the Mediterranean area in pre-Christian times. The breed’s name derives from its “blooded,” or purebred, ancestry.
Typically calm and affectionate, it has been used in tracking animals and in trailing persons for law enforcement or rescue operations. A large, strong dog, it stands 23 to 27 inches (58 to 68.5 cm) and weighs 80 to 110 pounds (36 to 50 kg). It has short hair and long ears; its loose skin falls into folds and wrinkles about the head and neck. The coat is black-and-tan, red-brown and tan, or tawny.
