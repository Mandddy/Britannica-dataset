Napster, file-sharing computer service created by American college student Shawn Fanning in 1999. Napster allowed users to share, over the Internet, electronic copies of music stored on their personal computers. The file sharing that resulted set in motion a legal battle over digital rights and the development of digital rights management software to prevent computer copyright piracy.
The arrival of Napster in 1999 marked the emergence of decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing of music over the Internet. At its peak in 2001 there were as many as 1.5 million people simultaneously sharing files worldwide by using Napster’s software to find and connect with one another, and Napster had embedded in the consciousness of consumers the idea of downloading songs from the Internet—bypassing the purchase of established distribution forms, such as records, tapes, or compact discs (CDs).
