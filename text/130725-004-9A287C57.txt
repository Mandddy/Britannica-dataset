Tipitaka, (
        Pali: “Triple Basket”) Sanskrit Tripitaka, often called the Pali Canon,  the complete canon, composed in Pali, of the Theravada (“Way of the Elders”) branch of Buddhism. The schools of the Mahayana (“Greater Vehicle”) branch also revere it yet hold as scripture additional writings (in Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, and other languages) that are not accepted as canonical by Theravada Buddhists. The books of this Pali canon were nearly all written in India within 500 years of the time of the Buddha (between about 500 bce and the beginning of the Common Era). They appeared not only in Pali within the Theravada communities that now predominate in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia but also in Sanskrit among the Sarvastivada (“Doctrine That All Is Real”), Mahasanghika (“Great Community”), and other schools that did not survive the demise of Buddhism in India. The Pali texts constitute the entire surviving body of literature in that language.
Each school had its own canonical collection that differed somewhat from others in the contents of particular texts, which texts it included, and the ordering of texts within the canon. There was more agreement on the first two sections, the Vinaya Pitaka (“Basket of Discipline”) and the Sutta Pitaka (“Basket of Discourse”; Sutra Pitaka) than on the third, the Abhidhamma Pitaka (“Basket of Special [or Further] Doctrine”; Abhidharma Pitaka).
