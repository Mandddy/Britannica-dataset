Van Wyck Brooks,  (born Feb. 16, 1886, Plainfield, N.J., U.S.—died May 2, 1963, Bridgewater, Conn.) American critic, biographer, and literary historian, whose “Finders and Makers” series traces American literary history in rich biographical detail from 1800 to 1915.
Brooks grew up in the wealthy suburb of Plainfield. Graduating from Harvard in 1907, Brooks went to England, where, while working as a journalist, he published his first book, The Wine of the Puritans (1908), in which he blamed the Puritan heritage for America’s cultural shortcomings. He explored this theme more thoroughly in his first major work, America’s Coming-of-Age (1915), which made a strong impact with its thesis that the Puritan duality that separated spiritual and money matters had resulted in a corresponding split in contemporary American culture between “highbrow” and “lowbrow” publics, neither of which was helpful to the writer.
