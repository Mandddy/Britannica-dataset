A Night at the Opera, American screwball comedy film, released in 1935, that is widely considered the Marx Brothers’ greatest production. It was their first film after leaving Paramount Pictures for MGM and the first Marx Brothers’ movie not to include Zeppo Marx.
The madcap film takes aim at stuffy opera lovers and the nouveau riche with equal aplomb. Otis B. Driftwood, a theatrical agent of dubious morals (played by Groucho Marx), is hired by social climber Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) to help her break into high society. He suggests she invest in an opera company, the success of which is contingent on his signing the famous Italian tenor Lassparri (Walter Woolf King). After mistakenly hiring Baroni (Allan Jones), Driftwood sails back to New York and is unexpectedly joined by stowaways—Baroni and his manager (Chico Marx) and Lassaparri’s former dresser (Harpo Marx). During the trip they become entangled with the charming young opera singer Rosa (Kitty Carlisle). After the ship docks, further comic mishaps ensue as the men try to help the careers of Rosa and Baroni.
