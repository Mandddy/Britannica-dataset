Stan Musial, in full Stanley Frank Musial, byname Stan the Man  (born November 21, 1920, Donora, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 19, 2013, Ladue, Missouri) American professional baseball player who, in his 22-year playing career with the St. Louis Cardinals, won seven National League (NL) batting championships and established himself as one of the game’s greatest hitters.
Musial was a phenomenal schoolboy athlete in both baseball and basketball, and he signed his first professional baseball contract while in high school. A left-handed batter and thrower, Musial began his career as a pitcher but developed a sore arm and switched to the outfield while still in the minor leagues. He quickly worked his way up through the Cardinals’ minor league system and made his major league debut in 1941. The following year Musial became a full-time player for St. Louis, where he teamed with Terry Moore and Enos Slaughter to form what would become one of the finest offensive and defensive outfield combinations in baseball history and played a significant role in the team’s 1942 World Series victory.
