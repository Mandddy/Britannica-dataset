Blindman’s buff, children’s game played as early as 2,000 years ago in Greece. The game is variously known in Europe: Italy, mosca cieca (“blind fly”); Germany, Blindekuh (“blind cow”); Sweden, blindbock (“blind buck”); Spain, gallina ciega (“blind hen”); and France, colin-maillard (named for a medieval fight between a French lord of Louvain [Leuven] and a man named Colin who fought with a mallet and was blinded in the battle). The game blindman’s buff is played in many areas other than Europe, however. For instance, in Papua New Guinea the game is known as kamu namu.
Among the Igbo in Nigeria, a version of the game is called Kola onye tara gi okpo? (“Can you find the person who knocked you on the head?”). In this version one child covers another child’s eyes with his hands, then a third child hits the “blind” child on the head and goes back to the circle of children. When the child who was struck is allowed to look, he must guess correctly who hit him. If he guesses correctly, the child who hit him must take his place as the next to be “blinded.”
