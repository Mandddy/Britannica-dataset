North Yorkshire, administrative and geographic county in northern England, part of the historic county of Yorkshire. The administrative county of North Yorkshire comprises seven districts: Craven, Hambleton, Richmondshire, Ryedale, Selby, and the boroughs of Harrogate and Scarborough. The geographic county comprises the entire administrative county; the unitary authorities of Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland, and York; and the part of the unitary authority of Stockton-on-Tees that lies south of the River Tees. The town of Northallerton, in north-central North Yorkshire, is the county seat.
The geographic county has two distinctive upland regions. The one in the west comprises the Pennines, the major uplands of northern England; they reach elevations higher than 2,200 feet (670 metres) in the northwest at Pen-y-Ghent, Whernside, Ingleborough, and Mickle Fell and are deeply dissected by the valleys (dales) of the Rivers Swale, Ure, Nidd, and Wharfe. In the east is a region of limestones and sandstones forming the upland mass of the North York Moors and Cleveland Hills. Separating those two regions is the Vale of York, a lowland with glacial clay soils. To the north the Cleveland Hills drop to the North Sea coast and the Tees valley in a dramatic escarpment.
