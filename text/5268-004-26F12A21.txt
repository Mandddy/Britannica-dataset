Sir Basil Zaharoff, original name Basileios Zacharias   (born Oct. 6, 1849, Muğla, Tur.—died  Nov. 27, 1936, Monte Carlo) international armaments dealer and financier. Reputedly one of the richest men in the world, he was described as a “merchant of death” and the “mystery man of Europe.”
He was the son of poor Greek parents who had Russified the family name during years spent in exile in Russia. As a young man he worked for his uncle in the cloth trade in Istanbul. In 1866 he was sent to England for further schooling, and in 1870 he became the representative in London for his uncle’s firm. Two years later his uncle accused him of embezzlement, but he was acquitted of the charge.
