Xavier Herbert, in full Alfred Francis Xavier Herbert   (born May 15, 1901, Port Hedland, W.Aus., Austl.â€”died Nov. 10, 1984, Alice Springs, Northern Territory) Australian novelist and short-story writer best known for his voluble novel Capricornia (1938), a comic chronicle about life in the Northern Territory of Australia and the inhumane treatment suffered by the Aborigines there at the hands of white men.
The son of a railroad engineer, Herbert knew many Aborigines as a child and learned their language. He studied pharmacy at the University of Melbourne but then turned to journalism, traveling over northern Australia and also working as a sailor, miner, aviator, deep-sea diver, and stock rider. In 1935 he became superintendent of Aborigines at Darwin, a position that led to the writing of Capricornia. He also spent two years in England and served as a sergeant during World War II.
