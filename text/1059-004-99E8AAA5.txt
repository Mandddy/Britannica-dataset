George Grenville,  (born October 14, 1712—died November 13, 1770, London, England) English politician whose policy of taxing the American colonies, initiated by his Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765, started the train of events leading to the American Revolution.
He entered Parliament in 1741, one of the “cousinhood” of men interrelated by blood or marriage and further united in their opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, who held power from 1721 to 1742 and practiced a policy of salutary neglect toward the American colonies. After holding a number of ministerial appointments, Grenville was recommended to George III by Lord Bute to be his successor as first lord of the Treasury (prime minister).
