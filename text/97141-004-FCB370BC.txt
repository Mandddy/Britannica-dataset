John Paul Stevens,  (born April 20, 1920, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1975 to 2010.
Stevens, who traced his American ancestry to the mid-17th century, attended the University of Chicago, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1941. During World War II he served in the navy, winning a Bronze Star. After the war, he attended the Northwestern University School of Law, graduating in 1947. He clerked for Wiley B. Rutledge (1947â€“48), an associate justice of the Supreme Court, before joining a Chicago law firm to specialize in antitrust law. He also taught law part-time at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University and served on various public commissions, including as counsel for a House of Representatives subcommittee that investigated the power of monopolies. In 1970 President Richard M. Nixon appointed Stevens circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh circuit, where he gained a reputation for his scholarly acumen and well-written decisions. After Justice William O. Douglas retired in 1975, Stevens was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Gerald R. Ford, winning unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate.
