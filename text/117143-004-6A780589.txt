John Sandfield Macdonald,  (born December 12, 1812, St. Raphael, Upper Canada [now Ontario]—died June 1, 1872, Cornwall, Ontario, Canada) joint premier of the Province of Canada as the attorney general of Canada West (1862–64) and first premier of Ontario (1867–71).
Macdonald was called to the bar in 1840, and the next year he was elected to the Canadian Parliament for Glengarry, a seat he held for 16 years. He supported constitutional government and in 1849–51 served as solicitor general. He was called by Governor-General Lord Monck to form a ministry in 1862 and, while serving as the attorney general of Canada West, he acted as joint premier of the Province of Canada for two years. Macdonald was critical of Canadian confederation, but after the Dominion of Canada was created in 1867, he accepted the post of first premier of Ontario and helped settle the relationship of provincial to federal government. When his government was defeated in 1871, Macdonald resigned.
