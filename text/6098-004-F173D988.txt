Kiva, subterranean ceremonial and social chamber built by the Pueblo Indians of the southwestern United States, particularly notable for the colourful mural paintings decorating the walls.
The traditional round shape of the earliest kivas contrasts with square and rectangular forms common in residential Pueblo architecture. The circular shape recalls the round pit houses of the prehistoric Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) from whom the Pueblo tribes are thought to have descended.
