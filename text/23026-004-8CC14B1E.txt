Roy Orbison,  (born April 23, 1936, Vernon, Texas, U.S.—died Dec. 6, 1988, Hendersonville, Tenn.) American singer-songwriter best remembered for his soaring voice, one of the most operatic in all rock music, and for his carefully crafted ballads of loneliness and heartache.
Raised in West Texas, Orbison formed his first musical group at age 13. He dropped out of college to pursue music, and as a member of the Teen-Kings he recorded “Ooby Dooby” in 1955 at Norman Petty’s studio in Clovis, New Mexico. When he rerecorded the song for Sam Phillips at Sun Records, it became his first hit. Phillips’s efforts to make Orbison a rockabilly star were unsuccessful, however, and the shy Texan (whose trademark sunglasses masked eyes the singer feared looked beady) moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he concentrated on writing songs for others, notably “Claudette” for the Everly Brothers.
