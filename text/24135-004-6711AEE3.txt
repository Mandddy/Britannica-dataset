Walter Brennan,  (born July 25, 1894, Lynn or Swampscott, Mass., U.S.â€”died September 21, 1974, Oxnard, Calif.) American character actor, best known for his portrayals of western sidekicks and lovable or irascible old codgers.
During his lifetime Brennan offered so many different versions of his early years that it is virtually impossible to separate fact from fancy. He may have left home at age 11, or perhaps he remained home until he graduated from high school. He may have trained to be an engineer like his father, but whether he attended college for this purpose is open to speculation. It is very likely that he worked as a lumberjack, ditchdigger, and bank messenger but less likely that he raised pineapples in Guatemala. While he undoubtedly served with the 101st Field Artillery in World War I, the assertion that he lost his teeth and acquired his grating high-pitched voice in a gas attack is probably apocryphal.
