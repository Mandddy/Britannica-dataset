Bitcoin, digital currency created by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Owners of Bitcoins can use various Web sites to trade them for physical currencies, such as U.S. dollars or euros, or can exchange them for goods and services from a number of vendors.
Nakamoto was concerned that traditional currencies were too reliant on the trustworthiness of banks to work properly. Nakamoto proposed a digital currency, Bitcoin, that could serve as a medium of exchange without relying on any financial institutions or governments. The proposal was made in October 2008 in a paper published on the Bitcoin Web site, which had been founded in August 2008.
