Artificial life, also called A-life or alife,  computer simulation of life, often used to study essential properties of living systems (such as evolution and adaptive behaviour). Artificial life became a recognized discipline in the 1980s, in part through the impetus of American computer scientist Christopher Langton, who named the field and in 1987 organized the first International Conference on the Synthesis and Simulation of Living Systems, or Artificial Life 1, at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Langton characterized artificial life as “locating life-as-we-know-it within the larger picture of life-as-it-could-be,” a concept that brought together people interested in computer models of adaptive and self-organizing systems, not just in biology but also in economics, social science, and physical chemistry.
Life on Earth is incredibly complex. Millions of species, constructed from a vast array of different chemicals, interact in innumerable ways. It is difficult to extract any general principles of biological design from among life’s messy details or to distinguish what is fundamental to life as a general phenomenon from what is merely an accident of how life evolved on Earth. The evolutionary clock cannot be turned back to see which features always appear, nor are any alien ecosystems available for comparison. A-life seeks to illuminate this problem by simulating lifelike processes within computers. By creating highly simplified artificial “aliens” and comparing their development and behaviour to real biology, it is often possible to discover something of life’s essential character.
