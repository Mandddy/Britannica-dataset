Downhill skiing, ski race for speed on an adjusted downhill course that is marked by gates formed by paired poles, set at least 8 metres (26 feet) apart, through which the racer must pass. Contestants make at least one timed practice run, then compete singly in an order set by previous performance and starting at one-minute intervals. The one who completes the course in the shortest time, without missing any gates, is the winner.
Downhill was, with the slalom, one of the original Alpine disciplines. In 1930 it was recognized by the world governing body of skiing, the Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS), as an official sport; the first downhill world championships were held the following year. Downhill debuted at the Olympics in a combined event (featuring both a downhill and a slalom race) in 1936 at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. It was first held as an Olympic medal event in 1948 at St. Moritz, Switzerland.
