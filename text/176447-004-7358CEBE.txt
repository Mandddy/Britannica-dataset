Harper, American detective-mystery film, released in 1966, that starred Paul Newman in one of his most popular antihero roles. The film was based on the novel The Moving Target (1949) by Ross Macdonald, and the screenplay was written by William Goldman.
Lew Harper (played by Newman) is a hip, hard-drinking, down-and-out private detective who takes more beatings than he dishes out. He is a loner in a long line of classic loners played by Newman as well as a wise-cracking cynic in the best tradition of Humphrey Bogart’s Sam Spade (from The Maltese Falcon) and Philip Marlowe (The Big Sleep). Aggravating Harper is his estranged wife (Janet Leigh), who serves him with divorce papers. At the recommendation of friend Albert Graves (Arthur Hill), he takes on a case to find a missing millionaire; the missing man’s wife is played by Lauren Bacall, in obvious homage to her first husband, Bogart. During the investigation he encounters frumpy former actress and alcoholic Fay Estabrook (Shelley Winters) and heroin-addicted singer Betty Fraley (Julie Harris). When Harper attempts to pay a ransom for the missing man, Fraley intercepts the cash. Harper later forces her to lead him and Graves to the place where the millionaire is being held and discovers the man has been murdered. Fraley is subsequently killed when she tries to escape, and Harper discovers on the ride home that Graves is the murderer. Graves confesses that he murdered the man out of hatred and because he was in love with the man’s daughter. He pulls a gun on Harper but finds himself unable to shoot his friend.
