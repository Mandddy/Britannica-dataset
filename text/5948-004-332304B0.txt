Indus River, Tibetan and Sanskrit Sindhu, Sindhi Sindhu, or Mehran,  great trans-Himalayan river of South Asia. It is one of the longest rivers in the world, with a length of some 2,000 miles (3,200 km). Its total drainage area is about 450,000 square miles (1,165,000 square km), of which 175,000 square miles (453,000 square km) lie in the ranges and foothills of the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush, and the Karakoram Range; the rest is in the semiarid plains of Pakistan. The river’s annual flow is about 58 cubic miles (243 cubic km)—twice that of the Nile River and three times that of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers combined. The river’s conventional name derives from the Tibetan and Sanskrit name Sindhu. The earliest chronicles and hymns of the Aryan peoples of ancient India, the Rigveda, composed about 1500 bce, mention the river, which is the source of the country’s name.
The river rises in the southwestern Tibet Autonomous Region of China near Lake Mapam at an elevation of about 18,000 feet (5,500 metres). For about 200 miles (320 km) it flows northwest, crossing the southeastern boundary of the disputed Kashmir region at about 15,000 feet (4,600 metres). A short way beyond Leh, in Ladakh (in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir), it is joined on its left by its first major tributary, the Zaskar River. Continuing for 150 miles (240 km) in the same direction into the Pakistani-administered areas of the Kashmir region, the Indus is joined by its notable tributary the Shyok River on the right bank. Below its confluence with the Shyok, as far as the Kohistan region of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, it is fed by mighty glaciers on the slopes of the Karakoram Range, the Nanga Parbat massif, and the Kohistan highlands. The Shyok, Shigar, Gilgit, and other streams carry glacial meltwater into the Indus.
