James Stewart, in full James Maitland Stewart, byname Jimmy Stewart   (born May 20, 1908, Indiana, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died July 2, 1997, Beverly Hills, California) major American motion-picture star known for his portrayals of diffident but morally resolute characters.
Stewart graduated from Princeton University with a degree in architecture and became part of the University Players at Falmouth, Massachusetts, joining such future film actors as Henry Fonda and Margaret Sullavan. During the years 1932–33, Stewart appeared in a few unsuccessful Broadway plays in which he was usually singled out for praise by New York critics. These positive reviews led to a motion-picture contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1934; after a couple of uncredited bit parts, he made his film debut in The Murder Man (1935) with Spencer Tracy. At first, Stewart’s slow, halting line delivery (perhaps his most readily identifiable trademark) and angular features made him difficult to typecast. His naive, engaging manner, however, led to quick acceptance by the moviegoing public. Stewart was loaned to Columbia for two Frank Capra films that proved pivotal in his career: You Can’t Take It with You (1938) and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), which brought him his first Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a shy, idealistic young senator fighting corruption in Congress. He won an Oscar the following year for another film classic, The Philadelphia Story (1940).
