William Conyngham Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket,  (born July 1, 1764, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ire.—died  Jan. 4, 1854, near Bray, County Wicklow) Anglo-Irish lawyer, parliamentary orator, successor to Henry Grattan (died 1820) as chief spokesman for Roman Catholic emancipation—i.e., admission of Catholics to the British House of Commons, a goal that was achieved in 1829.
Called to the Irish bar in 1787, Plunket was highly successful as an equity lawyer. Entering the Irish Parliament in 1798, he found that the British prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, was planning an Anglo-Irish legislative union that would abolish the Irish Parliament. During Grattan’s temporary retirement from politics (1797–1800), Plunket was the most vehement opponent of Pitt’s design, speaking often in the Irish legislature and writing articles for the newspaper Anti-Union (1798–99). On the passage of the Act of Union (Aug. 1, 1800), he returned to his law practice. In 1803 he acted for the crown in prosecuting the Irish nationalist Robert Emmet for his futile rising in Dublin. Emmet was executed, and later in the year Pitt appointed Plunket solicitor general of Ireland. Charged with disloyalty to the Irish cause by a writer in the Weekly Register, Plunket in 1804 recovered damages for libel from that periodical’s editor, the English radical William Cobbett.
