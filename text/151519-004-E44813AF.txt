Kevin Costner, in full Kevin Michael Costner  (born January 18, 1955, Lynwood, California, U.S.) American film actor and director, known for his portrayal of rugged individualists with sensitive streaks.
After graduating from business school at California State University, Fullerton (B.A., 1978), Costner began taking acting lessons following an encouraging encounter onboard an airplane with actor Richard Burton. Costner’s scenes were famously cut from The Big Chill (1983), the motion picture that provided the breakthrough for several other young actors, but its director, Lawrence Kasdan, later cast Costner in the western Silverado (1985). Costner’s first starring role was as Eliot Ness in The Untouchables (1987). His further success in the baseball movies Bull Durham (1988) and Field of Dreams (1989) made him a popular leading man, and he formed his own production company in 1989.
