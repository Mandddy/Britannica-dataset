New National Gallery, German Neue Nationalgalerie,  art museum in Berlin, Ger., featuring 20th-century European painting and sculpture.
The New National Gallery is one of the museums that make up the National Museums of Berlin. The name “New” refers both to the relatively new building and the age of its collection. The gallery places particular emphasis on work from the early 20th century through the 1960s. Built in 1968, the New National Gallery was the first building completed as a part of Berlin’s Kulturforum, a cluster of buildings dedicated to culture and the fine arts. Like the neighbouring Kulturforum structures, it is an example of imaginative Modernist architecture. Designed by celebrated modernist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, it is known popularly as the “temple of light and glass.”
