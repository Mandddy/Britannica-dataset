Cod-liver oil, pale yellow oil obtained primarily from the liver of the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, and other species of the family Gadidae. Cod-liver oil is a source of vitamins A and D. It was widely used in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries to treat and prevent rickets, a disease characterized by defective bone growth that is caused by a lack of vitamin D. Widespread fortification of milk with vitamin D in the United States and Europe beginning in the 1930s eliminated rickets as a significant public health problem, and with that physicians stopped recommending the use of cod-liver oil. It is still sold in health food stores as a vitamin supplement, as a remedy for joint pain caused by arthritis, and as a preventive of cardiovascular diseaseâ€”although these last benefits have not been proved scientifically. Cod-liver oil is also used in feeds for poultry and other animals.
Chemically, cod-liver oil is a typical fish oil. It is high in omega-3 fatty acids, a valuable aspect in nutrition but one that makes it subject to oxidation, rancidification, and destruction of vitamin A when it is exposed to air. Cod-liver oil is a mixture of glycerides of many fatty acids, predominantly oleic acid, gadoleic acid, and palmitoleic acid. Both vitamin A and vitamin D toxicity can result from the consumption of large amounts of cod-liver oil.
