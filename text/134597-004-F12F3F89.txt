Gioseffo Zarlino,  (born March 22, 1517, Chioggia, Rep. of Venice [Italy]—died  February 14, 1590, Venice) Venetian composer and writer on music, the most celebrated music theorist of the mid-16th century.
Zarlino took deacon’s orders in 1541 and studied music under Adriaan Willaert at St. Mark’s in Venice, where in 1565 he became music director. Although he was esteemed as a composer, few of his works survive. He was offered the bishopric of Chioggia in 1583, but the Venetian senate persuaded him to remain in Venice.
