Johnny Hodges, in full John Cornelius Hodges, bynames Jeep and Rabbit  (born July 25, 1906, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.—died  May 11, 1970, New York, N.Y.) American jazz saxophonist who was a featured soloist in Duke Ellington’s orchestra. Renowned for the beauty of his tone and his mastery of ballads, Hodges was among the most influential sax players in the history of jazz.
Initially Hodges was a self-taught musician, playing drums and piano before taking up the soprano saxophone at age 14. He then received instruction from the legendary Sidney Bechet, one of the first important jazz soloists and perhaps Hodges’s only major influence. He worked in Boston and New York during the mid-1920s, playing in bands led by Lloyd Scott, Chick Webb, Bobby Sawyer, Luckey Roberts, and Bechet. He joined Duke Ellington’s orchestra in 1928 and was the band’s most-featured soloist for the next four decades.
