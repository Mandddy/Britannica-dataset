Crocoite,  mineral consisting of lead chromate, PbCrO4, that is identical in composition to chrome yellow, the artificial product used in paint. The element chromium was discovered in this mineral in 1797. Crocoite occurs as long, well-developed, prismatic crystals; the most beautiful specimens are from Dundas, Tasmania. Other localities include the Urals, Brazil, and the southwestern United States. Crocoite has a bright hyacinth-red to orange colour and an adamantine to vitreous lustre that dulls on exposure to sunlight.
