Milk glass, opaque white glass (as opposed to white, or clear, glass) that was originally made in Venice before 1500 and in Florence between 1575 and 1587, where it was intended to simulate porcelain. In northern Europe it was made only to a very limited extent, with rare 17th-century examples coming from Germany or Bohemia. In the 18th century, milk glass became a substitute for the Chinese porcelain that was admired in Europe but that had proved difficult to reproduce. This milk glass was produced in England, Germany, and especially in Venice.
