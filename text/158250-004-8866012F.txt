James Garner, original name James Scott Bumgarner  (born April 7, 1928, Norman, Oklahoma, U.S.—died July 19, 2014, Brentwood, California) American actor who was noted for his portrayal of good-natured characters and reluctant heroes. He was perhaps best known for his roles in the television series Maverick and The Rockford Files.
After serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, Garner pursued an acting career. He made several television commercials before making his film debut in 1956, appearing in Mervyn LeRoy’s Toward the Unknown and the comedy The Girl He Left Behind. In 1957 he acted opposite Marlon Brando in the war drama Sayonara. That year Garner also began playing the gambler Bret Maverick on the television series Maverick. The western show, which was noted for its humour, was extremely popular, and it brought Garner national attention. A dispute with the studio, however, resulted in his leaving Maverick in 1960. Garner remained a sought-after performer, and his subsequent films included The Great Escape (1963), which starred Steve McQueen; The Americanization of Emily (1964), a comedy-drama about a coward who becomes a hero during World War II; and the western Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969).
