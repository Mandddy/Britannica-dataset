Sandra Bullock, in full Sandra Annette Bullock  (born July 26, 1964, Arlington, Virginia, U.S.) American actress and film producer known for her charismatic energy and wit on-screen, especially as girl-next-door characters in romantic comedies.
Bullock spent most of her childhood in Nürnberg, Germany, though she often traveled with her mother, who was a German opera singer, and occasionally performed in her mother’s productions. Bullock attended high school in Virginia, and she later studied drama at East Carolina University. In 1986 she moved to New York, where she studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. After receiving positive attention for the Off-Broadway play No Time Flat, Bullock made her motion-picture debut in Hangman (1987) and took supporting roles in such films as Religion, Inc. (1989) and the television movie Bionic Showdown: The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman (1989). Her first leading role was in Who Shot Pat? (1989), a romantic coming-of-age film that examines racial tensions in the 1950s. In 1990 Bullock starred in the short-lived TV series Working Girl, playing an ambitious New York City executive.
