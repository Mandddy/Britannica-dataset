Saint Peter Martyr, also called Peter of Verona, Italian San Pietro Martire or San Pietro da Verona   (born 1205?, Verona [Italy]—died April 6, 1252, near Milan; canonized 1253; feast day April 29) inquisitor, vigorous preacher, and religious founder who, for his militant reformation, was assassinated by a neo-Manichaean sect, the Cathari (heretical Christians who held unorthodox views on the nature of good and evil).
Peter’s parents were members of the Cathari, and there was some family opposition to Peter’s studying at the University of Bologna. There he befriended Dominic (Domingo de Guzmán), whose religious order, the Order of Friars Preachers, he entered about 1221.
