Minstrel, (
        Latin ministerium, "service"
            ) between the 12th and 17th centuries, a professional entertainer of any kind, including juggler, acrobat, and storyteller; more specifically, a secular musician, usually an instrumentalist. In some contexts, “minstrel” more particularly denoted a player of wind instruments, and in the 15th century it was sometimes even used for an instrument that he played, the shawm (an early form of oboe). The word minstrel—derived from the Old French and Provençal menestral—replaced the earlier jongleur (Provençal: joglar) about the 14th century.
The minstrel profession antedates its name. In the 4th century the gléoman is heard of among the Angles, and in the 6th century the Germanic scop is referred to. The Old English poem “Widsith” describes the role of a fictitious scop in Germanic society. In the 12th century there emerges a clearer picture of the performance and social situation of the minstrel. Many were attached to courts, some as musicians. Others, the great majority, traveled widely, staying for short times at places of potential patronage. Most minstrels were unable to write their music down; their art was one of memory and improvisation. Consequently, little of their music survives, but it is not unlikely that the best minstrels, some of whom commanded large salaries, performed music equal in sophistication to surviving examples of the 12th- and 13th-century polyphony (part music) that was composed by clerics (those who could write).
