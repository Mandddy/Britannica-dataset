Al Jolson, byname of Asa Yoelson   (born May 26, 1886, Srednike, Russia—died  Oct. 23, 1950, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.) popular U.S. singer and blackface comedian of the musical stage and motion pictures, from before World War I to 1940. His unique singing style and personal magnetism established an immediate rapport with audiences.
Taken to the United States when he was seven years old, Jolson was reared in Washington, D.C., where he made his first stage appearance in 1899. He performed with his brother and others in vaudeville before joining Lew Dockstader’s minstrel troupe in 1909. He became a popular New York entertainer and singer, being featured in the musicals La Belle Paree (1911), Honeymoon Express (1913), Bombo (1921), and Big Boy (1925). In Sinbad (1918) he transformed an unsuccessful Gershwin song, “Swanee,” into his trademark number. And in Bombo he introduced “My Mammy.” The same show included three Jolson favourites: “Toot, Toot, Tootsie,” “California, Here I Come,” and “April Showers.” Some of his biggest successes were achieved at the New York Winter Garden.
