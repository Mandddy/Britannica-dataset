Giant star, any star having a relatively large radius for its mass and temperature; because the radiating area is correspondingly large, the brightness of such stars is high. Subclasses of giants are supergiants, with even larger radii and brightness for their masses and temperatures (see supergiant star); red giants, which have low temperatures but are of great brightness; and subgiants, which have slightly reduced radii and brightness.
Some giants have luminosities hundreds of thousands of times that of the Sun. Their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is above the main sequence, in which the majority of stars, called dwarf stars in contrast, fall. Masses of giants and supergiants may be 10 to 30 times that of the Sun, but their volumes are often 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 times greater. Thus, they are low-density “diffuse” stars.
