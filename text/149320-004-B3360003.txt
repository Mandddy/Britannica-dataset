Defibrillation, the administration of electric shocks to the heart in order to reset normal heart rhythm in persons who are experiencing cardiac arrest or whose heart function is endangered because of severe arrhythmia (abnormality of heart rhythm).
There are several different kinds of defibrillation devices. The two major types are automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). AEDs are used in emergency situations involving cardiac arrest. They are portable and often can be found in places where large numbers of people circulate, such as airports. Immediate emergency response that enables early defibrillation is central to the successful restoration of heart rhythm during cardiac arrest. Emergency personnel are trained in the use of AEDs; however, AEDs are designed to be used by members of the general public as well, regardless of training. Many countries that supply AEDs in public areas offer training courses, often in conjunction with training in CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation).
