Speedway racing, automobile or motorcycle racing on a racecourse or track, usually oval and flat. Both speedway racing and Grand Prix racing, which is done on closed highways or other courses partly simulating road conditions, began in 1906. Speedway racing became the dominant kind of automobile racing in the United States. For the position of speedway racing in the history of automobile racing, see automobile racing.
Speedway racing for motorcycles began much later, originating in Australia in the 1920s. It also became popular in Europe by the 1930s and remained so. The racing is done on small, flat, oval tracks with lightweight motorcycles that have small fuel tanks and no brakes. Tracks measure about 350 yards (320 metres) and have unpaved surfaces of dirt, cinders, grass, or sand. Competition ranges from local to international in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Attendance at such races in Great Britain during the 1980s was said to be second only to that for football (soccer). World championships under the supervision of the Fédération Internationale Motocycliste were held from 1937.
