Kurt Warner, in full Kurtis Eugene Warner  (born June 22, 1971, Burlington, Iowa, U.S.) American professional gridiron football quarterback who won two National Football League (NFL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (1999, 2001) and a Super Bowl title (2000) as a player for the St. Louis Rams. He also guided the Arizona Cardinals to the franchise’s first Super Bowl berth (2009).
Unable to land a football scholarship to a Division I-A (now known as Football Bowl Subdivision) college, Warner attended the University of Northern Iowa, where he did not become a starter until his fifth and final year. After an unsuccessful tryout with the NFL’s Green Bay Packers in 1994, he played football in the Arena Football League with the Iowa Barnstormers from 1995 to 1997. In December 1997 Warner signed with the St. Louis Rams, and he was sent to play for the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe the following spring. Starting all 10 games for the Admirals that season, he led the league in passing with 2,101 yards.
