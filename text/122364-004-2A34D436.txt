Lassen Peak, also called Mount Lassen,  volcanic peak in northern California, U.S., the principal attraction of Lassen Volcanic National Park. The peak stands at the southern end of the Cascade Range, some 50 miles (80 km) east of Redding, and rises above the surrounding area to an elevation of 10,457 feet (3,187 metres). It is classified as a volcanic dome, formed when lava is too viscous to flow away and accumulates around its vent.
The volcano lies on the northern edge of an ancient caldera created when the top of Mount Tehama exploded and collapsed about 350,000 years ago. Lassen Peak was thought to be extinct when it erupted without warning on May 30, 1914. Minor eruptions continued for the following year, until May 19, 1915, when larger and more spectacular explosions propelled a stream of molten lava 1,000 feet (300 metres) down the mountain, melting snow and causing mudflows. Three days later a blast of hot gases felled many trees and produced a mushroom-shaped cloud that rose some 7 miles (11 km) above the summit. The eruptions ceased in 1921, but evidence has suggested the possibility of a periodic cycle for volcanic activity in the area.
