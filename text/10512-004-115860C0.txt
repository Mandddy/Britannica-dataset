James Kent,  (born July 31, 1763, Fredericksburgh, Putnam County, N.Y.—died Dec. 12, 1847, New York City) jurist whose decisions and written commentaries shaped the inchoate common law in the formative years of the United States and also influenced jurisprudence in England and other common-law countries. As chancellor of the New York Court of Chancery (1814–23), he is said to have made equity jurisprudence effective for the first time in U.S. legal history.
A lawyer at Poughkeepsie, N.Y., from 1785 and a New York state legislator from 1790, Kent moved to New York City in 1793, when he was appointed the first professor of law at Columbia University. He became a justice of the New York Supreme Court in 1798, chief justice of that tribunal in 1804, and chancellor of the state Court of Chancery (then the highest judicial office in New York) in 1814.
