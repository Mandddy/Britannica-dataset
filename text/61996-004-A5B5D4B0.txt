Dorothy Leib Harrison Wood Eustis, née Dorothy Leib Harrison  (born May 30, 1886, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died Sept. 8, 1946, New York, N.Y.)  American philanthropist and dog breeder whose work with German shepherds led her to establish and endow The Seeing Eye, Inc., and other groups for the training of guide dogs and their blind owners.
Dorothy Harrison in 1906 married Walter A. Wood, a businessman who operated an experimental farm for the selective breeding of dairy cattle. The remarkable intelligence and loyalty of her German shepherd dog, Hans, further stimulated her thinking about practical genetics. In 1917, two years after her husband’s death, she moved to Radnor, Pennsylvania, and in 1921 she moved to Vevey, Switzerland, where she established a kennel and began experimenting in the selective breeding of dogs.
