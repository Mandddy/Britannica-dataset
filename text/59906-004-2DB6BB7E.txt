Marionette, also called string puppet ,  any of several types of puppet figures manipulated from above by strings or threads attached to a control. In a simple marionette, the strings are attached in nine places: to each leg, hand, shoulder, and ear and at the base of the spine. By adding strings, more sensitive control of movement is achieved. Among European puppets, marionettes are considered the most delicate and difficult to master; some are capable of imitating almost every human and animal action.
Although this type of puppet was not fully developed until the mid-19th century, examples of marionettes controlled by an iron rod instead of strings still survive in Sicily and elsewhere. In the 18th century marionette operas, acting out the works of well-known composers, were extremely popular.
