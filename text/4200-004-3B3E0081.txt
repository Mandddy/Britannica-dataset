Darter, also called anhinga or snakebird,  any of two to four species of bird of the family Anhingidae (order Pelecaniformes or Suliformes). The American species, Anhinga anhinga, is widely acknowledged as distinct, but there is debate regarding whether the darters that appear in Africa, Asia, and Oceania constitute one species (A. melanogaster) or whether they should be separated into three (A. melanogaster, A. novaehollandiae, and A. rufa).
Darters are large (about 90 cm [35 inches] long), slender, long-necked water birds. Their backs are mostly black or dark brown, and their breasts are varying shades of brown and white, depending on the species. They have silvery wing markings. Males, glossed with green, develop pale head plumes and a dark “mane” in breeding season. The coloration of females is more muted. The snakebird is found in tropical to warm temperate regions except in Europe and lives in small colonies along lakes and rivers. It swims nearly submerged, with its head and neck showing above water and darting snakelike from side to side. The bird spears fish, which it carries ashore in its serrated bill.
