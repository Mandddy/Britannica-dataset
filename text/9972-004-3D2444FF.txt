Minesweeper,  naval vessel used to clear an area of mines (see mine). The earliest sweeping system, devised to clear anchored contact mines, consisted of two ships steaming across a minefield towing a wire rope between them; mine mooring lines were cut by sawlike projections on the sweep wire or by cutting jaws. When the released mine rose to the surface, it was destroyed by gunfire.
In naval warfare, minesweepers have two primary tactical functions: to clear mines from sea lanes in order to protect the minesweeping nation’s warships and merchant shipping; and to clear a path through minefields so that other warships can engage in battle or launch an amphibious landing (such as those in the Pacific theatre during World War II). Minesweepers can be just as vitally needed after a war has ended; hundreds of minesweepers were used to clear the tens of thousands of mines left floating in the world’s sea lanes after the end of World War II.
