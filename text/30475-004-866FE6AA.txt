Jean-Baptiste Biot,  (born April 21, 1774, Paris, France—died  Feb. 3, 1862, Paris) French physicist who helped formulate the Biot-Savart law, which concerns magnetic fields, and laid the basis for saccharimetry, a useful technique of analyzing sugar solutions.
Educated at the École Polytechnique, Biot was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Beauvais in 1797, became professor of mathematical physics at the Collège de France in 1800, and was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1803. He accompanied J.-L. Gay-Lussac in 1804 on the first balloon flight undertaken for scientific purposes. The men showed that the Earth’s magnetic field does not vary noticeably with altitude, and they tested upper atmospheric composition. Biot also collaborated with the noted physicist D.F.J. Arago in investigating the refractive properties of gases.
