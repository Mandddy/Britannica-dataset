Edward FitzGerald,  (born March 31, 1809, Bredfield, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Eng.—died  June 14, 1883, Merton, Norfolk) English writer, best known for his Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám, which, though it is a very free adaptation and selection from the Persian poet’s verses, stands on its own as a classic of English literature. It is one of the most frequently quoted of lyric poems, and many of its phrases, such as “A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou” and “The moving finger writes,” passed into common currency.
FitzGerald was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he formed a lifelong friendship with William Makepeace Thackeray. Soon after graduating in 1830, he retired to the life of a country gentleman in Woodbridge. Though he lived chiefly in seclusion, he had many intimate friends, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Thomas Carlyle, with whom he kept up a steady correspondence.
