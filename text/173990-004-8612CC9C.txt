Walkingstick (order Phasmida, or Phasmatodea), also called stick insect,  any of about 3,000 species of slow-moving insects that are green or brown in colour and bear a resemblance to twigs as a protective device. Some species also have sharp spines, an offensive odour, or the ability to force their blood, which contains toxic, distasteful chemicals, through special joints in the exoskeleton. In many species the eggs closely resemble seeds.
Walkingsticks are unusual among the insects in that they have the ability to regenerate legs and antennae. The front wings of some species are short and leathery, whereas others have large, colourful hind wings that are kept folded over the abdomen. Walkingsticks found in the tropics are the largest and most abundant. The longest specimen collected, belonging to the species Phryganistria chinensis, measured 62.4 cm (about 2 feet). Other large specimens—measuring more than 30 cm (12 inches) in body length—belong to the species Phobaeticus chani and Phobaeticus kirbyi, which are native to Borneo. The North American species Diapheromera femorata may defoliate oak trees during heavy infestations.
