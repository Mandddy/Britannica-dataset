Apprenticed to a stocking weaver, Dodsley ran away and went into domestic service as a footman; during this period he published a poem, Servitude (1729), which was later reissued as The Muse in Livery: or, the Footman’s Miscellany (1732). His other early works included a satirical farce, The Toy-Shop (1735). Financed by his friends, who included Alexander Pope, he established himself as a publisher in 1735, publishing Johnson’s poem London (1738) and suggesting and backing his Dictionary of the English Language.
