Ribosome, particle that is present in large numbers in all living cells and serves as the site of protein synthesis. Ribosomes occur both as free particles in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and as particles attached to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells. The small particles that came to be known as ribosomes were first described in 1955 by Romanian-born American cell biologist George E. Palade, who found them to be frequently associated with the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotic cells.
Ribosomes are remarkably abundant in cells. A single actively replicating eukaryotic cell, for example, may contain as many as 10 million ribosomes. In the bacterium Escherichia coli (a prokaryote), ribosomes may number as many as 15,000, constituting as much as one-quarter of the cellâ€™s total mass. The size of the ribosomes within cells varies, depending on the cell type and on factors such as whether the cell is resting or replicating. The average ribosome of E. coli, the best-characterized example, measures about 200 angstroms (about 20 nm) in diameter.
