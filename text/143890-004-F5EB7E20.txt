Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution museum located on the Mall in Washington, D.C., noted for its collection of Asian art.
The foundation of the gallery’s collection was a donation of approximately 1,000 works owned by Arthur M. Sackler, a New York City psychiatrist who also contributed $4 million toward the construction of the building. The Sackler Gallery was opened in 1987 and, along with the Freer Gallery, houses the Smithsonian Institution’s Asian art. The Sackler features extensive collections of Chinese jade figures, dating from Neolithic times to the 19th century, and bronze sculpture from the Shang through Han dynasties. It also contains a collection of 19th- and 20th-century Japanese art, and the Vever Collection of Persian and Indian manuscripts, books, and paintings. It includes as well artworks from rural India, contemporary Chinese ceramics, and paintings from China (including Tibet), Japan, India, and Korea. The gallery frequently displays international exhibitions on loan from other museums. The Sackler publishes the journal Artibus Asiae in cooperation with the Rietberg Museum in Zürich and sponsors scholarly lectures and symposia on specialized topics in Asian art. It shares a research library with the Freer Gallery.
