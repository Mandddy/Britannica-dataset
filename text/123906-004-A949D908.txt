Dan Marino, in full Daniel Constantine Marino, Jr.  (born September 15, 1961, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.) American gridiron football quarterback who was one of the most prolific passers in National Football League (NFL) history.
Marino was a high school All-American in Pittsburgh, where he established himself as another of the great quarterbacks to hail from western Pennsylvania, alongside such luminaries as Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana, and Joe Namath. Unlike those quarterbacks, Marino stayed home to play at the University of Pittsburgh, earning All-American honours in his junior year. After a disappointing senior season by Marinoâ€™s standards, his professional stock dropped, and he was chosen by the Miami Dolphins toward the end of the first round of the 1983 NFL draft.
