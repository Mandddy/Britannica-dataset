Forsythia, also called Golden Bell,  any member of a genus (Forsythia) of plants in the olive family (Oleaceae), containing seven species of ornamental shrubs native to eastern Europe and East Asia. In some species the yellow flowers borne along the stems appear before the leaves in early spring. The narrow leaves occasionally have three parts; the star-shaped flowers have four.
Green-stem forsythia (F. viridissima), native to China, may grow to 3 m (10 feet); it bears greenish yellow flowers. Weeping forsythia (F. suspensa), also from China, has hollow, pendulous stems about 3 m long and golden-yellow flowers. Common forsythia (F. intermedia), a hybrid between green-stem forsythia and weeping forsythia, has arching stems to 6 m and bright yellow flowers. There also are variegated, dwarf, and many-flowered varieties.
