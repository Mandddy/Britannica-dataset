Heinrich Schliemann, in full Johann Ludwig Heinrich Julius Schliemann  (born January 6, 1822, Neubukow, Mecklenburg-Schwerin [Germany]—died December 26, 1890, Naples, Italy) German archaeologist and excavator of Troy, Mycenae, and Tiryns. He is sometimes considered to be the modern discoverer of prehistoric Greece, though scholarship in the late 20th and early 21st centuries revealed that much self-mythologizing was involved in establishing his reputation.
Schliemann was the son of a poor pastor. By one of his autobiographical accounts, it was a picture of Troy in flames in a history book his father had given him when he was seven years old that remained in his memory throughout his life and sustained his fervent belief in the historical foundations of the Homeric poems. At age 14 he was apprenticed to a grocer, and—again, according to Schliemann—it was in the grocer’s shop that he heard Homer declaimed in the original Greek. He worked for several years at the grocery and then determined to emigrate. In order to do so, he became a cabin boy on a ship bound from Hamburg to Venezuela. After the vessel was wrecked off the Dutch coast, he became an office boy and then a bookkeeper for a trading firm in Amsterdam. He had a passion and a flair for languages, as well as a remarkable memory, and those factors, combined with great energy and determination, enabled him to learn to read and write several languages fluently. Accounts vary, but his competence certainly included Russian and both ancient and modern Greek.
