Anna Karina, original name Hanne Karin Blarke Bayer  (born September 22, 1940, Copenhagen, Denmark) Danish beauty prominently featured in French films of the 1960s, notably in those directed by her husband Jean-Luc Godard.
After finishing high school, Anna Karina studied dance and worked as a model for fashion magazines. She appeared in several industrial and independent films, including the noted short film Pigin og skoene (1959; The Girl and the Shoes), which was presented at the Cannes film festival. She moved to Paris that same year, where her meeting with French New Wave director Godard proved fortuitous for both. Although she turned down a role in his masterpiece Breathless (1960), she made Le Petit Soldat (1960, banned until 1963; The Little Soldier) with him shortly thereafter. The two were married in 1961; their six-year marriage was not as successful as their professional union. They produced a total of seven feature films together, including some of the most influential films of the 1960s.
