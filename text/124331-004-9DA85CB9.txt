Montreal Botanical Garden, French Jardin Botanique De Montréal,  botanical garden in Montreal founded in 1936 by Frère Marie-Victorin, one of the greatest of Canadian botanists. It has approximately 20,000 plant species under cultivation and maintains a herbarium consisting of nearly 100,000 reference specimens. Of the garden’s many greenhouses, 9 are for public display and 23 for service functions and research collections. Its significant collections and special gardens contain commercially important plants, medicinal herbs, alpine plants, woodland plants, ferns, bonsai, cacti and other succulents, begonias, aroids, bromeliads, gesneriads, and orchids. Other notable features include water gardens, a rock garden arranged by geographic region, a collection of cultivated perennial herbaceous plants for home gardeners, and an arboretum. The Botanical Institute of the University of Montreal uses some of the garden’s facilities, and, together, the two institutions form an important botanical research centre. The garden publishes the serial Mémoires du Jardin Botanique de Montréal.
