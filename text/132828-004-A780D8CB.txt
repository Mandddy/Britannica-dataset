Joseph Lieberman, in full Joseph Isadore Lieberman  (born February 24, 1942, Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.) American attorney and politician who was a longtime member of the U.S. Senate (1989–2013). Elected originally as a Democrat, he won reelection in 2006 as an independent after losing the Democratic Party primary. In 2000 he was the Democratic vice presidential nominee—the first Jewish candidate on a major party presidential ticket.
Lieberman studied at Yale University, where he earned both a B.A. (1964) and an LL.B. (1967). During the 1960s he was active in the civil rights movement and briefly practiced law. In 1970 (in a campaign in which future U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton, then a student at Yale, served as a volunteer) Lieberman was elected to the Connecticut Senate, and he was majority leader from 1975 to 1981. In 1980 he was defeated in a bid for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, but two years later he was elected Connecticut attorney general. In 1988 he won election to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first Orthodox Jew to sit in that body, and he was reelected in 1994. Lieberman, who served as the chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, took a generally centrist stance. Although he supported Democratic positions on issues such as campaign finance reform, abortion rights, and gun control, he broke ranks with his party by advocating school vouchers, cuts in capital gains taxes, and limits on liability awards.
