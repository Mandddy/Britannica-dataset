Francisco Solano López,  (born July 24, 1826, Asunción, Para.—died March 1, 1870, Concepción province) dictator of Paraguay during the Paraguayan War (also known as the War of the Triple Alliance), in which Paraguay was practically destroyed by Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.
López, the eldest son of the dictator Carlos Antonio López, seized power upon his father’s death (Sept. 10, 1862) and quickly established his own supremacy with the help of the army. Showing little understanding of his country’s need to remain neutral in squabbles between the two South American giants, Brazil and Argentina, early in 1863 he allowed himself to be drawn into boundary disputes with both countries and to become entangled in a civil war raging in Uruguay in which Brazil and Argentina were involved. He evidently hoped to play the role of arbitrator in the dispute and thereby take centre stage in Latin American politics. As a result of complicated diplomatic intrigues, however, López found himself at war with Brazil in December 1864. By demanding the right to place troops in the Argentine province of Corrientes, he violated Argentina’s desire to remain neutral and provoked the alliance of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay against Paraguay on May 1, 1865.
