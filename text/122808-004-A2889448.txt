Carlo Gambino,  (born Sept. 1, 1902, Palermo, Sicily, Italy—died  Oct. 15, 1976, Massapequa, N.Y., U.S.) head of one of the Five Families of organized crime in New York City from 1957 to 1976, with major interests in Brooklyn, and reputedly the “boss of bosses” of the U.S. national crime syndicate.
Born in Sicily, Gambino immigrated to the United States in 1921 as a ship stowaway, settling in Brooklyn and becoming a gang member under, successively, Joe “the Boss” Masseria, Salvatore Maranzano, Philip and Vincent Mangano, and finally (in 1951) Albert Anastasia. When Anastasia was murdered in 1957 (allegedly by Gambino and another gunman and with Vito Genovese’s approval), Gambino inherited leadership of the family, whose operations included gambling, loansharking, hijacking, narcotics trafficking, and, notably, labour racketeering, with extensive controls over waterfront unions.
