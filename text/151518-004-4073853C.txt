Ernest Borgnine, original name Ermes Effron Borgnino  (born January 24, 1917, Hamden, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 8, 2012, Los Angeles, California) American actor whose portly physique and coarse features made him a commanding presence in scores of films and television productions, in which he skillfully portrayed characters ranging from brutish thugs to hapless everymen.
Borgnino was born to Italian immigrant parents. As a small child, he moved with his mother to northern Italy for several years before returning to Connecticut, at which point his family changed its surname. After graduating from high school in 1935, Borgnine served in the U.S. Navy for six years and then reenlisted once the United States entered World War II, rising to the rank of gunner’s mate first class by the time of his discharge in 1945. Initially ambivalent about his civilian career prospects, Borgnine pursued acting at the encouragement of his mother, taking advantage of the G.I. Bill to study for six months at the Randall School in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1946 he joined the Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, where he worked backstage before earning roles in more than a dozen productions.
