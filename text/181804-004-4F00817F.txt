Carrion beetle (family Silphidae), any of a group of beetles (insect order Coleoptera), most of which feed on the bodies of dead and decaying animals, thus playing a major role as decomposers. A few live in beehives as scavengers, and some eyeless ones live in caves and feed on bat droppings. Carrion beetles range in size from minute to 35 mm (1.4 inches), averaging around 12 mm (0.5 inch). Many have bright orange, yellow, or red markings on a dark background, while others are completely black. The flat, flexible body and wings allow these insects to crawl under dead animals. The long, flat larvae that emerge from eggs deposited in carrion have a triangular point at each tapering end. After they emerge from the eggs, the larvae feed for the first few days on a brown liquid regurgitated by the parents.
Because some carrion beetles dig the ground out from under a small carcass, such as that of a mouse or small bird, and bury it, they are also known as burying beetles.
