Fernán Caballero, pseudonym of Cecilia Böhl von Faber, or Cecilia Böhl de Faber   (born December 24, 1796, Morges, Switzerland—died April 7, 1877, Sevilla, Spain) Spanish writer whose novels and stories depict the language, customs, and folklore of rural Andalusia.
Her father was Johann Niklaus Böhl von Faber, a German businessman who converted to Roman Catholicism and became a well-known critic of Spanish literature. He moved the family in 1813 to Andalusia, which was the native region of his wife. In 1816 their daughter Cecilia married Antonio Planells, a Spanish infantry officer who was killed in action the following year. In 1822 the young widow married the marqués de Arco Hermoso, in whose homes in Sevilla (Seville) and the Andalusian countryside she collected much of the material for her books. Upon his death in 1835 Cecilia found herself in straitened circumstances, and in 1837 she married a much younger man, Antonio de Ayala, whose unfortunate business speculations eventually drove him to suicide in 1859.
