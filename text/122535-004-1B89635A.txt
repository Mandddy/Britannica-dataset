Edam,  semisoft cow’s-milk cheese of Holland, usually molded in 2 to 4 pound (0.9 to 1.8 kilogram) spheres and coated in red paraffin; Edam is also produced in red-coated rectangular loaves. Originally the rind was brushed with vermilion to distinguish it from other Dutch cheeses, a purpose now served by the red paraffin.
The smooth-textured interior of Edam is a rich yellow-gold, with a mild but savoury flavour that makes it popular as a snack cheese. Like Gouda, it is one of Europe’s oldest commercial cheeses, widely exported and imitated. True Edam bears the mark of “Holland” on its rind. Aging generally lasts for two months but may extend to a year. Prolonged aging imparts a much stronger flavour and a harder, somewhat flaky consistency.
