Korea, history of the Korean peninsula from prehistoric times to the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War (1950â€“53). For later developments, see North Korea: History; and South Korea: History.
Archaeological, linguistic, and legendary sources support the view that the Korean peninsula was settled by Tungusic-speaking peoples who migrated in waves from Manchuria and Siberia. They settled along the coasts and moved up the river valleys. These peoples formed the dominant ethnic foundation of the Korean people and developed the Korean language. There was a close relationship between Korean culture and that of neighbouring peoples during the Neolithic Period (New Stone Age) and the Bronze Age. For example, Korean comb pottery, widely used in the Neolithic Period, is commonly found in northeastern Asia; Korean bronze daggers, belt hooks, and knobbed mirrors also display the traits of bronze tools unearthed elsewhere in the region.
