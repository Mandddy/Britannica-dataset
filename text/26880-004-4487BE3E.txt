Walt Whitman, in full Walter Whitman   (born May 31, 1819, West Hills, Long Island, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  March 26, 1892, Camden, N.J.) American poet, journalist, and essayist whose verse collection Leaves of Grass is a landmark in the history of American literature.
Walt Whitman was born into a family that settled in North America in the first half of the 17th century. His ancestry was typical of the region: his mother, Louisa Van Velsor, was Dutch, and his father, Walter Whitman, was of English descent. They were simple farm people, with little formal education. The Whitman family had at one time owned a large tract of land, but it was so diminished by the time Walt was born that his father had taken up carpentering, though the family still lived on a small section of the ancestral estate. In 1823 Walter Whitman, Sr., moved his growing family to Brooklyn, which was enjoying a boom. There he speculated in real estate and built cheap houses for artisans, but he was a poor manager and had difficulty in providing for his family, which increased to nine children.
