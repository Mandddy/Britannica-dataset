Verrucaria, genus of lichens of the family Verrucariaceae, often found as a black crust covering seashore rocks. Along with the effects of weathering, Verrucaria helps break down limestone rocks by secreting acids that dissolve the cement holding together the rock particles. This produces an environment for the growth of mosses and higher plants.
