French Open, byname of French Championships, French in full Championnats Internationaux de France de Tennis (“France’s International Championships of Tennis”),  international tennis championship tournament established as a men’s interclub competition in 1891.
The first French national championships were held in the Stade Français. In 1897 women’s singles matches were added to tournament play. Women’s doubles matches were added in 1925, the same year that the championships were opened to non-French players. In 1968 the tournament was opened to professional as well as amateur players, as were a number of the most established championships. Play moved in 1928 to the Stade Roland-Garros, which contains clay courts. The French Open is generally held in late May–early June. It is a constituent tournament—with Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, and the Australian Open—in the “Grand Slam” of tennis.
