Ritz Brothers, American comedy team of three brothers, celebrated for their parodies and energetic slapstick humour. Their true surname was Joachim, and the three were known as Al (Alfred; b. August 27, 1901, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.—d. December 22, 1965, New Orleans, Louisiana), Jimmy (b. October 23, 1904, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.—d. November 17, 1985, Los Angeles, California), and Harry (Herschel May; b. May 28, 1907, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.—d. March 29, 1986, San Diego, California).
The three brothers grew up in Brooklyn, New York. As each graduated from high school he began a separate career as a dancer, and in 1925 they began performing together as a precision dance-comedy team. Popularity in vaudeville and Broadway revues was followed by fame in films, at first in such musicals as Sing Baby Sing (1936) and On the Avenue (1937), in which they supplied comic relief, and then in films in which they starred, such as Kentucky Moonshine (1938) and The Gorilla (1939). Altogether the antic trio made 16 films, most during 1936–43, after which they became a leading attraction in nightclubs. The Ritz Brothers’ act, on film and live, featured their singing in similar voices, complicated dance routines, and rowdy comedy centred on Harry Ritz, the most animated of the trio and the source of much of their material. (Later comedians such as Jerry Lewis, Mel Brooks, and Sid Caesar acknowledged Harry Ritz’s influence on their own work.) After Al collapsed onstage during a 1965 nightclub engagement, Jimmy and Harry continued to work together occasionally until 1978.
