Jimmie Foxx, in full James Emory Foxx, also called Double X and the Beast  (born October 22, 1907, Sudlersville, Maryland, U.S.—died July 21, 1967, Miami, Florida) American professional baseball player, the second man in major league history to hit 500 home runs. (Babe Ruth was the first.) A right-handed hitter who played mostly at first base, he finished with a total of 534 home runs. His career batting average was .325.
Foxx was a sensational schoolboy athlete, playing with a semiprofessional baseball team in the summer after his junior year of high school. He was so successful that the Philadelphia Athletics of the American League (AL) purchased his contract, and Foxx left high school during his senior year to join the team at spring training. He played sparingly from 1925 to 1927 before becoming a regular in the team’s lineup in 1928.
