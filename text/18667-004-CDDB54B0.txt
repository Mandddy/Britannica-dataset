Nassau, county, southeastern New York state, U.S., on central Long Island just east of the borough (and county) of Queens, New York City. It consists of a coastal lowland region bordered to the north by Long Island Sound and to the south by the Atlantic Ocean. Embayments along the north shore include Manhasset and Oyster bays, while a string of barrier islands on the Atlantic coast enclose such bodies of water as East and South Oyster bays. Parklands include Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge and Bethpage, Hempstead Lake, and Jones Beach state parks.
Delaware Indians occupied the area when Dutch and English settlers arrived in the first half of the 17th century. By the Treaty of Hartford (1650), the territory west of a line drawn from Oyster Bay southward to the Atlantic was given to the Dutch, only to become part of the English province of New York in 1664. The area was occupied by the British during the U.S. War of Independence and was again subject to British harassment during the War of 1812. The region grew rapidly with the coming of the railroad in the 1840s, as numerous (often fashionable) suburban residential communities developed. Nassau county was created from Queens county in 1899 and named for the family of William III of England. Mineola is the county seat.
