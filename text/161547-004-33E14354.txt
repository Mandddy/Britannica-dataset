João Guimarães Rosa,  (born June 27, 1908, Cordisburgo, Brazil—died November 19, 1967, Rio de Janeiro) novelist and short-story writer whose innovative prose style, derived from the oral tradition of the sertão (hinterland of Brazil), revitalized Brazilian fiction in the mid-20th century. His portrayal of the conflicts of the Brazilian backlanders in his native state of Minas Gerais reflects the problems of an isolated rural society in adjusting to a modern urban world.
Guimarães Rosa studied medicine at Belo Horizonte and became a physician. His urge to travel, however, soon led him into the Brazilian foreign service, and he became a diplomat in several world capitals, attaining ambassadorial rank in 1963.
