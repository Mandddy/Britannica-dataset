Ludwig Boltzmann, in full Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann  (born February 20, 1844, Vienna, Austriaâ€”died September 5, 1906, Duino, Italy) physicist whose greatest achievement was in the development of statistical mechanics, which explains and predicts how the properties of atoms (such as mass, charge, and structure) determine the visible properties of matter (such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion).
After receiving his doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1866, Boltzmann held professorships in mathematics and physics at Vienna, Graz, Munich, and Leipzig.
