Martha McChesney Berry,  (born Oct. 7, 1866, near Rome, Ga., U.S.—died Feb. 27, 1942, Atlanta, Ga.)  American educator whose personal efforts made education and work-study available to thousands of children in rural Georgia.
Born on a Georgia plantation, Berry was tutored at home and in 1882–83 attended a fashionable girls’ school in Baltimore, Maryland. On the death of her father in 1887, she inherited a considerable estate. Her career began largely by chance when, one Sunday in the late 1890s, while reading in a cabin retreat her father had built for her, she was approached by three mountain children. She entertained them with Bible stories, and on succeeding Sundays more and more children appeared. Struck by their lack of educational opportunity, she resolved to open a school for them. A conventional day school, open half the year, proved insufficient to break the bonds of apathy, however, and in January 1902 she opened the Boys’ Industrial School. Her plan was to eke out the school’s resources, which at first were entirely of her giving, by having the students, who were generally of high-school age, contribute labour for two hours a day in a pioneering work-study program; the experience of work would supplement their vocational training.
