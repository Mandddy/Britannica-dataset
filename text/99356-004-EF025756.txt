Henry George,  (born Sept. 2, 1839, Philadelphia—died Oct. 29, 1897, New York City) land reformer and economist who in Progress and Poverty (1879) proposed the single tax: that the state tax away all economic rent—the income from the use of the bare land, but not from improvements—and abolish all other taxes.
Leaving school before his 14th birthday, George worked for two years as a clerk in an importing house and then went to sea. Back in Philadelphia in 1856, he learned typesetting and in 1857 signed up as a steward on another ship, quitting it in San Francisco to join the gold rush in Canada, where, however, he arrived too late. In 1858 he returned to California, where he worked for newspapers and took part in Democratic Party politics until 1880. In 1871 he and two partners started the San Francisco Daily Evening Post, but credit difficulties forced them to close it in 1875. A political appointment as state gas-meter inspector enabled him to work on Progress and Poverty, which caught the spirit of discontent that had arisen from the economic depression of 1873–78. This popular book was translated into many languages. Its vogue was enhanced by George’s pamphlets, his frequent contributions to magazines, and his lecture tours in both the United States and the British Isles.
