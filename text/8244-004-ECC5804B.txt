Johan Ludvig Emil Dreyer,  (born Feb. 13, 1852, Copenhagen—died  Sept. 14, 1926, Oxford) Danish astronomer who compiled the New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, published in 1888, and its supplements, published in 1895 and 1908. This work, together with the supplements, was republished in 1953; it still remains one of the standard reference catalogs.
In 1874 Dreyer was appointed assistant at Lord Rosse’s observatory in Parsonstown (now Birr), County Offaly, Ire. Four years later he moved to Dunsink Observatory in Dublin. In 1882 he became director of the observatory at Armagh, Ire.; he retired from this post in 1916. That same year he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. He later served as the society’s president (1923–24).
