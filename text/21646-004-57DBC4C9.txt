Helen Gahagan attended Barnard College, New York City, for two years before seeking a career on the stage. After a Broadway debut in the short-lived Manhattan (1922), she appeared in a number of plays over the next several years, gaining a reputation as a competent actress and a stunningly beautiful woman. In 1928 she left the theatre to study operatic singing, and she made several successful appearances on European stages. In 1930 she returned to New York City and the theatre. In Tonight or Never, David Belasco’s last Broadway production, she met Melvyn Douglas, whom she married in 1931. Her notable stage appearances over the next few years included Moor Born (1934), Mary of Scotland (1934), Mother Lode (1934), and And Stars Remain (1936), and in 1935 she starred in a film version of She.
