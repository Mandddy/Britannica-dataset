Amado Nervo, original name Juan Crisóstomo Ruiz De Nervo   (born August 27, 1870, Tepic, Mexico—died May 24, 1919, Montevideo, Uruguay) poet and diplomat, generally considered the most distinguished Mexican poet of the late 19th- and early 20th-century literary movement known as Modernismo. Nervo’s introspective poetry, characterized by deep religious feeling and simple forms, reflects his struggle for self-understanding and inner peace in an uncertain world.
Nervo abandoned his studies for the priesthood in 1888 to begin a career as a newspaperman in Mazatlán. In 1894 he moved to Mexico City, where he wrote his first novel, El bachiller (1895; “The Baccalaureate”), and his first volume of poetry in the modernist idiom, Perlas negras (1898; “Black Pearls”). In 1898 he was one of the founders of the Revista moderna (“Modern Review”), which soon became one of the most influential journals of Modernismo.
