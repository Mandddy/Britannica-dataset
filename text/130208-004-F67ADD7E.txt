Chronic granulomatous disease, a group of rare inherited diseases characterized by the inability of certain white blood cells called phagocytes to destroy invading microorganisms.
Individuals born with this defect are vulnerable to many bacterial and fungal infections, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella species. Recurrent infections can result in the formation of tumourlike masses called granulomas. Although these masses are not cancerous, they can cause serious disruption of bodily functions depending on where they arise; e.g., they can obstruct urine flow or the passage of food through the digestive tract. Other effects of chronic infection include enlarged lymph nodes and gingivitis (inflamed and swollen gums). Symptoms and signs of chronic granulomatous disease appear during infancy, although less severe cases also occur in children, adolescents, and adults.
