Leiothrix,  genus of birds of the babbler family Timaliidae (order Passeriformes), with two species: the silver-eared mesia, or silver-ear (L. argentauris), and the red-billed leiothrix (L. lutea), which is known to cage-bird fanciers as the Pekin, or Chinese, robin (or nightingale). Both range from the Himalayas to Indochina; L. lutea has been introduced into Hawaii, where it is commonly called hill robin. The silver-ear has yellow, gray, red, and black markings; the “robin” has a golden throat, orange or red breast, yellow wings marked with blue (and red, in the male), and a blue-tipped tail that is forked and outcurved. Both species are 15 cm (6 inches) long and have brief, sweet songs.
