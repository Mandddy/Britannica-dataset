Saints Anne and Joachim,  (flourished 1st century bc, Palestine; Western feast day July 26, Eastern feast day July 25) the parents of the Virgin Mary, according to tradition derived from certain apocryphal writings. Information concerning their lives and names is found in the 2nd-century-ad Protevangelium of James (“First Gospel of James”) and the 3rd-century-ad Evangelium de nativitate Mariae (“Gospel of the Nativity of Mary”). According to these sources, Anne (Hebrew: Ḥannah) was born in Bethlehem, Judaea. She married Joachim, and, although they shared a wealthy and devout life at Nazareth, they eventually lamented their childlessness. Joachim, reproached at the Temple for his sterility, retreated into the countryside to pray, while Anne, grieved by his disappearance and by her barrenness, solemnly promised God that, if given a child, she would dedicate it to the Lord’s service. Both received the vision of an angel, who announced that Anne would conceive and bear a most wondrous child.
The couple rejoiced at the birth of their daughter, whom Anne named Mary. When the child was three years old, Joachim and Anne, in fulfillment of her divine promise, brought Mary to the Temple at Jerusalem, where they left her to be brought up. This event became so important in church doctrine that by 1585 Pope Sixtus V included in the Western church calendar the liturgical feast of the Presentation of the Virgin Mary (November 21). Although this festival originated early in the East, probably at Jerusalem in 543, its first Western observance was recorded in England in the 11th century.
