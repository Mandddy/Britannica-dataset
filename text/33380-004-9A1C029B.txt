Louis Ellies Dupin,  (born June 17, 1657, Paris—died  June 6, 1719, Paris) French church historian whose history of Christian literature, Nouvelle Bibliothèque des auteurs ecclésiastiques, 58 vol. (1686–1704; “New Library of Ecclesiastical Writers”), broke with scholastic tradition by treating biography, literary and doctrinal criticism, and bibliography in one work and by writing in a modern language. The opinions he expressed in this work were strongly opposed by the renowned French historian and orator Jacques Bossuet and others. The work was censured by the archbishop of Paris in 1691, and, although Dupin retracted, it was suppressed in 1696.
An apologist for Gallicanism (the ecclesiastical doctrine advocating restriction of papal power), Dupin was exiled to Châtellerault, Fr., in 1713, charged with Jansenism (a heretical doctrine de-emphasizing the freedom of the will and teaching that redemption through Christ’s death is limited to some) after he protested Pope Clement XI’s anti-Jansenistic bull Unigenitus. He was freed by again retracting. His later years were spent on projects for the reunion of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. While visiting France in 1717, Tsar Peter I the Great commissioned Dupin to draft a plan for the reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman churches. His works include a Bibliothèque universelle des historiens, 2 vol. (1707; “Universal Library of Historians”), and L’Histoire de l’église en abrégé, 4 vol. (1712; “A Brief History of the Church”). Nouvelle Bibliothèque was placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1757.
