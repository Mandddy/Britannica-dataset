Shadow play,  type of theatrical entertainment performed with puppets, probably originating in China and on the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali. Flat images are manipulated by the puppeteers between a bright light and a translucent screen, on the other side of which sits the audience. Shadow plays are also performed in Turkey and Greece. In the 18th and 19th centuries, shadow plays called ombres chinoises (“Chinese shadows”) achieved a limited degree of popularity, especially in France. See also Karagöz; ombres chinoises; wayang.
