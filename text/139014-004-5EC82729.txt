Xuzhou, Wade-Giles romanization Hsü-chou, conventional Süchow, formerly (1912–45) Tongshan,  city, northwestern Jiangsu sheng (province), eastern China. It is located in a gap in the southern portion of the Shandong Hills that constitutes a southwestern extension of the North China Plain. Through this gap flows the Feihuang River (in a former riverbed of the Huang He [Yellow River]), which joins the Si River and the Grand Canal, thus providing a water route southeastward to the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang). Situated at the junction of four neighbouring provinces (Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong), Xuzhou since ancient times has been both a transportation centre and a strategic point that has been repeatedly fought over by warring parties. Pop. (2002 est.) city, 1,210,841; (2007 est.) urban agglom., 2,091,000.
The gap in the Shandong Hills was first utilized by a canal built in the 2nd century bce during the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce) to connect Luoyang (in present-day Henan province) with the lower Huai River valley. The route, known as the Old Bian Canal, was replaced after the construction of the New Bian Canal (also known as the Tongji Canal) in 605, which took a route farther southward. Xuzhou nevertheless remained a route centre and a major commercial city until the 12th century.
