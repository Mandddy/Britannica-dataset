Stock (genus Matthiola), genus of about 50 species of plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae), native to Eurasia and southern Africa. Many stock species are well known for the spicy fragrance of their flowers, and some are grown as ornamentals and for cut flowers.
Gillyflowers, or common stock (Matthiola incana), are biennials native to southwestern Europe and western Asia. It is one of the most important species used by the floral and horticultural industries. The plants feature narrowly oval deep green leaves and produce 60- to 80-cm (25- to 30-inch) spikes of lilac to white four-petaled flowers, though many cultivars and garden varieties are red, crimson, yellow, and deep purple. Some varieties have double flowers.
