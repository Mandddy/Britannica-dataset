Jacques Prévert,  (born Feb. 4, 1900, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Fr.—died  April 11, 1977, Omonville-la-Petite) French poet who composed ballads of social hope and sentimental love; he also ranked among the foremost of screenwriters, especially during the 1930s and ’40s.
From 1925 to 1929 Prévert was associated with the Surrealists Robert Desnos, Yves Tanguy, Louis Aragon, and André Breton and renewed, in their style, the ancient tradition of oral poetry that led him to a highly popular form of “song poems,” which were collected in Paroles (1945; “Words”). Many were put to music by Josef Kosma and reached a vast audience of young people who liked Prévert’s anticlerical, anarchistic, iconoclastic tones, crackling with humour. He lashed out at stupidity, hypocrisy, and war, and he sang of lovers in the street and the metro and of simple hearts and children. Most popular is his Tentative de description d’un dîner de têtes à Paris-France (1931; “Attempt at a Description of a Masked Dinner at Paris, France”).
