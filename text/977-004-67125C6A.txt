Barry Goldwater, in full Barry Morris Goldwater   (born Jan. 1, 1909, Phoenix, Ariz., U.S.—died May 29, 1998, Paradise Valley, Ariz.) U.S. senator from Arizona (1953–64, 1969–87) and Republican presidential candidate in 1964.
Goldwater dropped out of college and began working in his family’s Phoenix department store, Goldwater’s, of which he was president from 1937 to 1953. He was elected to the Phoenix city council in 1949, and in 1952 he narrowly won election to the U.S. Senate. He was reelected in 1958 by a large majority. A conservative Republican, he called for a harsher diplomatic stance toward the Soviet Union, opposed arms-control negotiations with that country, and charged the Democrats with creating a quasi-socialist state at home.
