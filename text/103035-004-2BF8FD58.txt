Mayo, Irish Maigh Eo (“Plain of the Yew Trees”),  county in the province of Connaught, western Ireland. Mayo is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean (north and west) and by Counties Sligo (northeast), Roscommon (east), and Galway (southeast and south). Castlebar, in central Mayo, is the county town (seat). Other important towns include Ballina (the seat of the Roman Catholic bishop of Killala) and Westport.
Mayo’s extensive coastline is wild and broken, with many inlets from Killala Bay in the north to Killary Harbour in the southwest. Westport and Ballina are port towns, and there are numerous islands and inland lakes. Stretching east and north from Lough (Lake) Carrowmore is the largest expanse of bog in Ireland, 200 square miles (520 square km) in area. The principal rivers in Mayo are the Moy and the Errif. The low peaks of Nephin (2,646 feet [807 metres]) and Croagh Patrick (2,510 feet [765 metres]) dominate the landscape, and Mweelrea (2,688 feet [819 metres]), to the north of Killary Harbour, is the highest mountain in Connaught.
