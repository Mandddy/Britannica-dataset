Dennis Brutus, in full Dennis Vincent Brutus   (born November 28, 1924, Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia [now Harare, Zimbabwe]—died December 26, 2009, Cape Town, South Africa) poet whose works centre on his sufferings and those of his fellow blacks in South Africa.
For 14 years Brutus taught English and Afrikaans in South Africa. As the white minority government increased restrictions on the black population, he became involved in a series of antiapartheid-related activities, including efforts to end discrimination in sports. The government subsequently banned him from teaching, writing, publishing, attending social or political meetings, and pursuing his studies in law at the University of the Witwatersrand. In 1963 his refusal to abide by the ban resulted in an 18-month prison term. His campaigns eventually led to South Africa’s suspension from the 1964 Olympic Games. Due in part to Brutus’s continued pressure on the International Olympic Committee, South Africa was later officially expelled from the Olympics and did not compete again until 1992.
