Cy Young, byname of Denton True Young  (born March 29, 1867, Gilmore, Ohio, U.S.—died Nov. 4, 1955, Newcomerstown, Ohio) American professional baseball player, winner of more major league games (511) than any other pitcher.
Young grew up on a farm, and his formal education ended in sixth grade so he could help his family with their daily farming duties. He began playing baseball at this time and became so proficient at the sport that he joined two local semi-professional teams in the summer of 1884. In 1890 Young signed his first professional contract: with a Canton, Ohio, minor league team, with whom he acquired the nickname “Cyclone,” which was soon shortened to “Cy.” A big right-hander, standing 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 metres) tall and weighing 210 pounds (95 kg), he drew the attention of major league clubs, and his contract was purchased by the Cleveland Spiders of the National League (NL) after Young had played just half of a season in Canton.
