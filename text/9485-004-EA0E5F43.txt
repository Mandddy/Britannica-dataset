Sapsucker,  either of two species of North American woodpeckers of the family Picidae (order Piciformes), noted for drilling holes in neat close rows through the bark of trees to obtain sap and insects. They also catch insects in midair.
The yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), about 20 cm (8 inches) long, breeds in northern regions (south in mountains) and migrates as far as the West Indies and Central America; red-breasted and red-naped races occur west of the Rocky Mountains. Both sexes of varius have bold head-markings. The other species, Williamsonâ€™s sapsucker (S. thyroideus), is found in high pine forests of the western United States but is uncommon throughout its range.
