Suze Orman,  (born June 5, 1951, Chicago, Ill., U.S.) American financial adviser and author known for her unconventional approach to money, which combined personal finance with personal growth.
Orman was the daughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants and attended the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, where she earned a degree in social work (1976). She later moved to Berkeley, Calif., and became a waitress. Hoping to open her own restaurant, she collected money from friends and diners, but a stockbroker lost the funds in a series of bad investments. The experience piqued Orman’s interest in finance, and she entered Merrill Lynch’s stockbroker training program. As the first female stockbroker hired by the firm in northern California, she quickly displayed her unique style. At times using a crystal on her desk for guidance, Orman sought out ordinary people, such as small-business owners and truck drivers, rather than wealthy individuals, and before making any investments, she established a relationship with her clients in an effort to figure out “what made them click.” Her methods proved highly profitable, and by 1980 she was named account executive. In 1983 she joined Prudential Bache Securities as vice president of investments and four years later opened the Suze Orman Financial Group. After initial success, however, the firm was forced to close after a dispute over commissions with an employee.
