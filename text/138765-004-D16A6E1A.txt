Mitchell River,  river in northern Queensland, Australia. It rises near Rumula on the Atherton Plateau section of the Eastern Highlands, 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Cairns, and flows for 350 miles (560 km) northwest across Cape York Peninsula to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Although the stream, fed by the Palmer, Walsh, and Lynd rivers, has the state’s largest discharge, it is intermittent and may be dry for three months each year. The river was explored in 1845 by Ludwig Leichhardt and was named for Sir Thomas Mitchell, surveyor general for New South Wales. The river flows through country covered with wild scrub, and crocodiles abound along its banks. The Mitchell River Mission (Anglican) serves the Aboriginal reservation near the river’s mouth.
