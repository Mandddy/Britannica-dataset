Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard,  (born April 10, 1877, London—died May 29, 1971, London) lord chief justice of England from 1946 to 1958. Seldom lenient but always respectful of legal proprieties, he set a valuable example to the lower judiciary in controlling the crime wave that followed World War II in England.
From 1917 Goddard served successively as recorder (judge) of Poole (Dorset), Bath, and Plymouth until 1932, when he was made judge of the high court of justice, King’s Bench division. In 1938 he became a lord justice of appeal and in 1944 a lord of appeal in ordinary, and he was created a life peer as Baron Goddard of Aldbourne, Wiltshire. His work as lord chief justice was especially notable because he assumed the office at the age of 69.
