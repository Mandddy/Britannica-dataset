To Have and Have Not, American romantic adventure film, released in 1944, that was loosely based on Ernest Hemingway’s 1937 novel of the same name. The film is perhaps best known for the chemistry between Lauren Bacall, in her film debut, and Humphrey Bogart.
To Have and Have Not is set on the island of Martinique during World War II. Harry Morgan (played by Humphrey Bogart) is a charter-boat captain who takes wealthy clients on fishing trips. He initially turns down an offer to smuggle a French resistance leader onto the island but changes his mind after falling for the sultry Marie Browning (Bacall), an American pickpocket he has affectionately dubbed “Slim” (she calls him “Steve”). Browning needs money to return to the United States, and Morgan agrees to retrieve the underground leader and his wife in order to pay for her ticket and to recoup some monetary losses he recently suffered. After being paid in advance, he buys Browning a ticket for a plane leaving that afternoon. Morgan and his smuggled passengers narrowly escape being caught by a patrol boat, and when he returns, Morgan is surprised to find that Browning stayed behind to be with him. Later, the police capture Eddie (Walter Brennan), Morgan’s crewman, and threaten to force him to tell them about the boat’s cargo. Morgan, however, rescues Eddie, and with Marie, they escape the island.
