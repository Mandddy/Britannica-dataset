Sun Microsystems, Inc., former American manufacturer of computer workstations, servers, and software. In 2010 the company was purchased by Oracle Corporation, a leading provider of database management systems.
Andreas Bechtolsheim, William Joy, Vinod Khosla, and Scott McNealy founded Sun Microsystems, Inc., in 1982 for the purpose of selling low-cost high-performance desktop computers running the UNIX operating system. Those computer workstations found immediate acceptance among engineers, software developers, and scientists who benefited from having dedicated machines rather than sharing more expensive minicomputers or mainframe computer systems.
