Marion Davies, original name Marion Cecilia Douras  (born January 3, 1897, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died September 22, 1961, Los Angeles, California) American actor renowned more for her 34-year relationship with publishing giant William Randolph Hearst than for her performance career.
Marion’s father, Bernard J. Douras, was a lawyer who would serve as New York City magistrate from 1918 to 1930. Her three older sisters—Reine, Ethel, and Rose—also became actors, and, like Reine, Marion used the stage name Davies. At age 13, Davies made her Broadway debut as a chorus girl in The Blue Bird, and she continued to appear in shows until 1917, when 54-year-old publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst noticed her in the chorus line of The Ziegfeld Follies. Hearst was a married man, but he and Davies began a relationship that lasted until his death in 1951. Hearst proceeded to use his influence and his money to establish a film career for Davies. According to his obituary in The New York Times, Hearst spent $7 million promoting Davies’s career.
