International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), astronomical research satellite built in the 1970s as a cooperative project of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Science and Engineering Research Council of the United Kingdom, and the European Space Agency (ESA). Launched Jan. 26, 1978, the IUE functioned until it was shut down on September 30, 1996, and was one of the most productive astronomical instruments in history.
The cylindrical satellite measured 4.2 metres (13.8 feet) in length and weighed 644 kg (1,420 pounds) on launch. In addition to telemetry units, a computer, batteries, and a pair of solar panels for power, the IUE carried a 45-cm (17.7-inch) reflecting telescope equipped with two spectrographs linked to television cameras. The spectrographs covered a range of ultraviolet wavelengths that are prevented from reaching the ground by the Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
