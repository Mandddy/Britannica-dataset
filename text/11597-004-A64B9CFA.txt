Pont du Gard, (French: “Bridge of the Gard”), giant bridge-aqueduct, a notable ancient Roman engineering work constructed about 19 bc to carry water to the city of Nîmes over the Gard River in southern France. Augustus’ son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, is credited with its conception. Three tiers of arches rise to a height of 155 feet (47 m). The first tier is composed of 6 arches, from 51 to 80 feet (15 to 24 m) wide, the largest spanning the river; the second tier is composed of 11 arches of the same dimensions; the third, carrying the conduit, is composed of 35 smaller (15-foot) arches. Like many of the best Roman constructions, it was built without mortar. The structure was severely damaged in the 5th century but was restored in 1743. A highway bridge has since been added to the structure alongside its base.
