Interference fringe,  a bright or dark band caused by beams of light that are in phase or out of phase with one another. Light waves and similar wave propagation, when superimposed, will add their crests if they meet in the same phase (the waves are both increasing or both decreasing); or the troughs will cancel the crests if they are out of phase; these phenomena are called constructive and destructive interference, respectively. If a beam of monochromatic light (all waves having the same wavelength) is passed through two narrow slits (an experiment first performed in 1801 by Thomas Young, an English scientist, who inferred from the phenomenon the wavelike nature of light), the two resulting light beams can be directed to a flat screen on which, instead of forming two patches of overlapping light, they will form interference fringes, a pattern of evenly spaced alternating bright and dark bands. All optical interferometers function by virtue of the interference fringes that they produce.
