Environmental infrastructure, infrastructure that provides cities and towns with water supply, waste disposal, and pollution control services. They include extensive networks of aqueducts, reservoirs, water distribution pipes, sewer pipes, and pumping stations; treatment systems such as sedimentation tanks and aeration tanks, filters, septic tanks, desalination plants, and incinerators; and waste disposal facilities such as sanitary landfills and secure hazardous-waste storage impoundments. These municipal works serve two important purposes: they protect human health and safeguard environmental quality. Treatment of drinking water helps to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, and proper waste treatment and disposal practices prevent degradation of ecosystems and neighbourhoods. Similarly, cleaning the air of pollutant gases and particles as they are generated prevents adverse effects on both human health and the environment.
Steady population growth, urbanization, and industrial development place steadily increasing demands on existing infrastructure, and these demands in turn create a need for the planning, design, and construction of new environmental works. Because the provision, operation, and maintenance of these works require a major investment of public funds, concerned citizens as well as municipal officials and decision makers should be familiar with the basic concepts of environmental engineering.
