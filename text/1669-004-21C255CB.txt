Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), a general-purpose synthetic rubber, produced from a copolymer of styrene and butadiene. Exceeding all other synthetic rubbers in consumption, SBR is used in great quantities in automobile and truck tires, generally as an abrasion-resistant replacement for natural rubber (produced from polyisoprene).
SBR is a mixture of approximately 75 percent butadiene (CH2=CH-CH=CH2) and 25 percent styrene (CH2=CHC6H5). In most cases these two compounds are copolymerized (their single-unit molecules linked to form long, multiple-unit molecules) in an emulsion process, in which a soaplike surface-acting agent disperses, or emulsifies, the materials in a water solution. Other materials in the solution include free-radical initiators, which begin the polymerization process, and stabilizers, which prevent deterioration of the final product. Upon polymerization, the styrene and butadiene repeating units are arranged in a random manner along the polymer chain. The polymer chains are cross-linked in the vulcanization process.
