Constantine IX Monomachus,  (born c. 980â€”died  Jan. 11, 1055) Byzantine emperor from 1042 to 1055.
Constantine owed his elevation to Zoe, the empress of the Macedonian dynasty, who took him as her third husband. Constantine belonged to the civil party, the opponents of the military magnates, and he neglected the defenses of the empire and reduced the army. He spent extravagant sums on luxuries and magnificent buildings and seriously debased the coinage. Rebellions broke out at home and abroad; the Normans were overrunning the Byzantine possessions in south Italy; the Pechenegs (Patzinaks) crossed the Danube River and attacked Thrace and Macedonia; and the Seljuq Turks made their appearance on the Armenian frontier, which was directly exposed to attack, as the Armenian kingdom of Ani lapsed to Constantinople during this reign.
