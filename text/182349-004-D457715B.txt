James Chadwick, in full Sir James Chadwick  (born October 20, 1891, Manchester, England—died July 24, 1974, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire) English physicist who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1935 for the discovery of the neutron.
Chadwick was educated at the University of Manchester, where he worked under Ernest Rutherford and earned a master’s degree in 1913. He then studied under Hans Geiger at the Technische Hochschule, Berlin. When World War I broke out, he was imprisoned in a camp for civilians at Ruhleben. He spent the entire war there but nevertheless was able to accomplish some scientific work. After the war ended, Chadwick returned to England to study under Rutherford at the University of Cambridge. He received a doctorate in 1921, and in 1923 he was appointed assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. There he and Rutherford studied the transmutation of elements by bombarding them with alpha particles and investigated the nature of the atomic nucleus, identifying the proton, the nucleus of the hydrogen atom, as a constituent of the nuclei of other atoms.
