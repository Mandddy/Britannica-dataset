Saki, any of seven species of arboreal South American monkeys having long nonprehensile furred tails. The “true” sakis of the genus Pithecia are approximately 30–50 cm (12–20 inches) long, not including the bushy, tapering tail of 25–55 cm. Females generally weigh less than 2 kg (4.4 pounds) and males more than 2 kg. These sakis are covered with long, coarse hair that falls like a hood on the head and a cape over the shoulders.
The male pale-headed saki (P. pithecia) is black with a whitish face surrounding the dark muzzle, but the female is grizzled gray with a gray face and a white line on either side of the muzzle. The other four species, including the monk saki (P. monachus), are grizzled gray with less difference between the sexes. Sakis are active by day (diurnal) and live in monogamous pairs. They feed on fruit, leaves, and especially seeds, which they grind in their powerful jaws. Births are single; the young at first cling to the female’s belly and later are carried on her back until they are able to travel independently. They are gentle in captivity but nervous and difficult to keep.
