Olivier de La Marche,  (born c. 1425, Villegaudin, Burgundy—died  Feb. 1, 1502, Brussels) Burgundian chronicler and poet who, as historian of the ducal court, was an eloquent spokesman of the chivalrous tradition.
After serving as a page to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, La Marche entered the service of the Duke’s son, the count of Charolais (later called Charles the Bold). He became Charles’s secretary and remained in Burgundian service all his life, representing Charles on many diplomatic missions throughout Europe. After Charles was killed at Nancy in 1477, La Marche continued to serve the Duke’s heiress, Mary, and her husband, the Austrian archduke Maximilian.
