Helmet shell,  any marine snail of the family Cassidae (subclass Prosobranchia, class Gastropoda), characterized by a large, thick shell with a shieldlike inner lip. An example is the 18-centimetre (7-inch) king helmet (Cassis tuberosa) of the Caribbean.
Cameos are carved from helmet shells. Smaller, more rounded cassids (Phalium) are called bonnet shells.
