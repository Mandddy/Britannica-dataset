Teide Peak, Spanish Pico del Teide,  volcanic peak at the centre of the island of Tenerife, in the Santa Cruz de Tenerife provincia (province) of the Canary Islands comunidad aut칩noma (autonomous community), Spain. At 12,198 feet (3,718 metres), it is the highest point on Spanish soil. Teide is the peak atop El Pil칩n, a 492-foot- (150-metre-) high volcanic cone that rises from a crater on the upper reaches of the mountain El Teide, which is itself a conglomeration of several volcanoes rising within a 10-mile- (16-km-) wide caldera called Las Ca침adas. Snow covers the summit only in winter. Teide Peak has a crater about 260 feet (80 metres) in diameter. Hot gases are ejected from vents within the crater and on the slopes. The last eruption of the mountain El Teide was in 1909, on the northwestern flank of the volcano. El Teide dominates Teide National Park (established 1954), in which it is located. The park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007. An international solar observatory is located at Iza침a, about 4 miles (6 km) northeast of the park.
