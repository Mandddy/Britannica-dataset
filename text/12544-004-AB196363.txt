Cueca, in full zamacueca, also called marinera,  folk dance of northern Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. A courtship dance known since the period of Spanish colonization, it is danced to the rapid, rhythmic music of guitars. The dancing couple pursue and retreat, pass and circle about each other, twirling handkerchiefs as they dance. Chilean sailors took the dance to Mexico (where it is called chilena).
