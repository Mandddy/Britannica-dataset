Olav Duun,  (born November 21, 1876, Fosnes, Jøa Island, Norway—died September 13, 1939, Tønsberg) novelist who is one of the outstanding writers of 20th-century Norwegian fiction.
Duun, a former cattle herder and fisherman, entered a teacher’s college at age 26. He worked as a teacher in Holmestrand on the Oslo Fjord until 1927, when he retired to devote himself to writing. His many novels analyze the psychological and spiritual characteristics of peasant life. His masterpiece is a series of six novels, collectively entitled Juvikfolke (1918–23; The People of Juvik), describing the development of a peasant family through several generations (from 1814 to 1920) and symbolically tracing the development of the Norwegian people from a state of unself-conscious primitivism to one of civilized humanism complicated by throwbacks to their earlier violent heritage. The novels in the series, all of which have been translated into English, are Juvikingar (1918; Trough of the Waves), I blinda (1919; The Blind Man), Storbrylloppe (1920; The Big Wedding), I eventyre (1921; “In Fairyland”; Eng. trans. Odin in Fairyland), I ungdommen (1921; “In Youth”; Eng. trans. Odin Grows Up), and I stormen (1923; The Storm).
