Filarete, original name Antonio di Pietro Averlino or Averulino   (born c. 1400, Florence?—died c. 1469, Rome) architect, sculptor, and writer, who is chiefly important for his Trattato d’architettura (“Treatise on Architecture”), which described plans for an ideal Renaissance city.
Filarete is thought to have been trained under Lorenzo Ghiberti in Florence. From 1433 to 1445 he was employed by Pope Eugenius IV to execute the bronze central doors of Old St. Peter’s in Rome (installed in the new St. Peter’s in 1619). By comparison with the contemporary bronze doors of Ghiberti and Donatello in Florence, Filarete’s door is less accomplished in composition and technique but is important for its hieratic classicizing style. The first Renaissance monument of a specifically Roman type, it influenced the work of Isaia da Pisa and later Roman sculptors of the 15th century. In 1448 he returned to Florence, entering in 1451 the service of Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan. In Milan he was active principally as an architect and designed the Ospedale Maggiore (1457–65, finished in the 18th century), among the first Renaissance buildings in Lombardy.
