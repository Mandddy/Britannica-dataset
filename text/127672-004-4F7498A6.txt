Extrasolar planet, also called exoplanet,  any planetary body that is outside the solar system and that usually orbits a star other than the Sun. The first extrasolar planets were discovered in 1992. More than 3,000 are known, and more than 1,000 await further confirmation.
Because planets are much fainter than the stars they orbit, extrasolar planets are extremely difficult to detect directly. By far the most successful technique for finding and studying extrasolar planets has been the radial velocity method, which measures the motion of host stars in response to gravitational tugs by their planets. The first planet discovered with this technique was 51 Pegasi b in 1995. Radial velocity measurements determine the sizes and shapes of the orbits of extrasolar planets as well as the lower limits of the masses of these planets. (They provide only lower limits on planetary mass because they measure just the portion of the starâ€™s motion toward and away from Earth.)
