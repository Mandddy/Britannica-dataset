The U.S. Congress granted a charter for the university in 1821. It was then known as the Columbian College. The original impetus for a university in the District of Columbia had come from George Washington, who felt the capital city should have a national university. The school attained university status in 1873; the current name was adopted in 1904. Past students of the university have included F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover and U.S. senator J. William Fulbright. Edward Teller and George Gamow conducted important research in nuclear physics while on the faculty of George Washington University.
