Fanny Cerrito, in full Francesca Teresa Giuseppa Raffaela Cerrito  (born May 11, 1817, Naples, Italy—died May 6, 1909, Paris, France) ballerina noted for the brilliance, strength, and vivacity of her dancing, and one of the few women in the 19th century to achieve distinction as a choreographer.
The daughter of an officer in the Neapolitan army, Cerrito was trained in the ballet school of the San Carlo opera house, latterly under the supervision of Salvatore Taglioni. She made her first stage appearance in 1832 and quickly established a reputation in Italy as a future star of the ballet. In 1836–37 her fame began to spread beyond Italy when she appeared in Vienna, where she revealed a creative side to her talent by arranging some of her own dances. Between 1838 and 1840, engaged as principal ballerina at La Scala in Milan, she attracted still wider attention. The French writer Alfred de Musset worked her into one of his poems, and the director of the Paris Opéra hurried to see her, only to be forestalled by a rival impresario from London.
