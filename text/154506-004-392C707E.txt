Temple Grandin,  (born August 29, 1947, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.) American scientist and industrial designer whose own experience with autism funded her professional work in creating systems to counter stress in certain human and animal populations.
Grandin was unable to talk at age three and exhibited many behavioral problems; she was later diagnosed with autism. Her parents, rejecting a doctor’s advice to place her in an institution, instead sent their daughter to a series of private schools where her high IQ was nurtured. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree (1970) in psychology from Franklin Pierce College (now Franklin Pierce University) in New Hampshire, she earned a master’s degree (1975) and a doctorate (1989) in animal science from Arizona State University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, respectively. From 1990 she taught animal science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, where she also managed Grandin Livestock Systems.
