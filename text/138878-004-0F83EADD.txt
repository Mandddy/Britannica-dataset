Rai, also called Khambu,  a people indigenous to eastern Nepal, living west of the Arun River in the area drained by the Sun Kosi River, at elevations of 5,500–7,700 feet (1,700–2,300 m), and also in southwestern Bhutan. The most populous group of the Kiranti people, the Rai numbered about 635,000 at the turn of the 21st century. They speak several dialects of Kiranti, a Tibeto-Burman language. With the Limbu and Magar peoples, they supplied the bulk of the Gurkha contingent to the British-Indian armies. The Rai are subsistence farmers and stock raisers, depending primarily on crops of rice, corn (maize), and millet. They terrace the mountains for wet rice paddies and build their stone houses in the dry rice fields. They are also expert weavers. In the past the Rai traded grains and buffalo hides for salt and other goods with the Sherpas. Their basic economic and political unit is the kinship group, which contains several endogamous subdivisions. Although influenced by both Buddhism and Hinduism, the Rai retain their traditional religion, a worship of local deities and common ancestors.
