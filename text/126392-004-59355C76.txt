The Southern Conference had been organized in 1921 to promote and govern intercollegiate athletics. By 1953 some of the member schools felt the conference had grown too large and unwieldy for competitive athletic scheduling. At the conferenceâ€™s spring meeting, seven schools withdrew and formed the ACC. Virginia, which had not been a member of the Southern Conference, eventually joined the new organization, while the University of South Carolina, an original member, withdrew in 1971.
