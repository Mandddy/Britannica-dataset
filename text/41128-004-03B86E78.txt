William Murdock,  (born Aug. 21, 1754, Old Cumnock, Ayr, Scot.—died  Nov. 15, 1839, Birmingham, Warwickshire, Eng.) Scottish inventor, the first to make extensive use of coal gas for illumination and a pioneer in the development of steam power.
In 1777 Murdock entered the engineering firm of Matthew Boulton and James Watt in their Soho works at Birmingham and about two years later was sent to Cornwall to superintend the fitting of Watt’s steam engines. At his home in Redruth, Cornwall, he experimented in distilling coal and in 1792 lighted his cottage and offices with coal gas. After returning to Birmingham about 1799, he perfected further practical methods for making, storing, and purifying gas.
