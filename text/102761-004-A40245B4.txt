Rugby Union World Cup, also called Rugby World Cup,  quadrennial union-rules rugby competition that is the sport’s premier international contest.
The first Rugby World Cup competition organized by the International Rugby Board (IRB) was held in 1987 in New Zealand and Australia and was a popular and financial success. It was staged four years after a failed attempt to launch a global “rebel” (that is, outside the control of the IRB) professional championship. The 1991 World Cup, held in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France and won by Australia, had confirmed its place as a major international sporting festival. By the early 21st century, the Rugby World Cup could claim to be the third largest international televised sporting event as the tournament reached over 200 countries and some 4 billion viewers.
