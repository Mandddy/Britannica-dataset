Günther,  (born 1304, Blankenburg, Harz—died  June 14, 1349, Frankfurt am Main) count of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg and rival king of Germany (1349), who claimed the throne as successor to the Holy Roman emperor Louis IV the Bavarian (died 1347) in opposition to Charles of Luxembourg.
The younger son of Henry VII, count of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg (died 1323), Günther inherited Blankenburg and Saalfeld in 1330. He served as a diplomat and military commander for Louis IV from 1334 to 1339. After Louis IV’s death, the electors of Brandenburg, Saxe-Lauenburg, Frankfurt, and the archbishopric of Mainz, who were partisans of the Wittelsbach house, of which Louis IV had been a member, offered the throne to Edward III, king of England. When Edward declined (1348), they offered it to Günther; he was elected king at Frankfurt on January 30 and crowned on Feb. 6, 1349.
