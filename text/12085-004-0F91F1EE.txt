Rabbe Enckell, in full Rabbe Arnfinn Enckell  (born March 3, 1903, Tammela, Finland—died June 17, 1974, Helsinki) Finnish poet, playwright, and critic, a leading representative of the Swedo-Finnish poetic revival that began in the 1920s.
Enckell studied art in France and Italy. His first collection of impressionistic nature poems, Dikter, appeared in 1923. In this collection and a sequel, Flöjtblåsarlycka (1925; “The Flutist’s Happiness”), Enckell describes with a painter’s eye the exquisite nuances in the phenomena of nature. A modernist, he was associated with the avant-garde journal Quosego in 1928–29. After writing a few semiautobiographical novels, including Ljusdunkel (1930; “Chiaroscuro”), Enckell returned to poetry with Vårens cistern (1931; “The Cistern of Spring”), followed by Tonbrädet (1935; “The Sounding Board”). His poetic diction became more modern and contained reminiscences of the work of T.S. Eliot. Valvet (“The Vault”), another collection of his poems, appeared in 1937.
