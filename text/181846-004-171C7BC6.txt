Michael Jan de Goeje,  (born August 13, 1836, Dronrijp, Netherlands—died  May 17, 1909, Leiden) Dutch scholar who edited many Arabic works, most important of which was the medieval history Annals of Tabari, 13 vol. (1879–1901).
Attracted to Oriental languages during childhood, Goeje became proficient in Arabic. During his postdoctoral studies at the University of Oxford, he collated the Bodleian Library manuscripts of the important medieval Arabic geographer Idrīsī and published a part of this work with R.P. Dozy under the title Description de l’Afrique et de l’Espagne (1866; “Description of Africa and Spain”). About the same time he wrote Mémoires d’histoire et de géographie orientales (1866; “Memoirs of Oriental History and Geography”). He became professor of Arabic at Leiden (1883–1906) and was also chief editor of the first three volumes of the Encyclopaedia of Islam (1908).
