Dow Jones average, stock price average computed by Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. The averages are among the most commonly used indicators of general trends in the prices of stocks and bonds in the United States. Dow Jones &amp; Company, a financial news publisher founded by Charles Henry Dow and Edward D. Jones, began computing a daily industrials average in 1896, using a list of 12 stocks and dividing their total price by 12. The list of stocks has since been broadened, and the divisor has been adjusted to compensate for stock splits, stock substitutions, and significant dividend changes. Thus, the averages are not arithmetical means but averages meant to indicate general market price trends. The most commonly quoted is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is based on the prices of 30 industrial stocks. Other Dow Jones averages include one based on 20 transportation stocks, one based on 15 utility stocks, a composite based on 65 stocks, and several bond averages. Other popular gauges of the American securities markets are the S&amp;P 500 and the Russell 2000 indexes.
