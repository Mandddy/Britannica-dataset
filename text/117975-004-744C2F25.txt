Alexander Jackson Davis,  (born July 24, 1803, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Jan. 14, 1892, West Orange, N.J.) American architect, designer, draftsman, and illustrator who was best known for his innovative, picturesque country houses. He helped establish the familiar type of American rural house in the “carpenter Gothic” style of the mid-19th century.
Davis became a skilled architectural draftsman and came to know the architect Ithiel Town, whose partner he became in 1829. The firm of Town and Davis designed many public buildings in the Greek Revival style, including the Indiana State Capitol (1831–35) in Indianapolis, the North Carolina State Capitol (1833–40) in Raleigh, and the West Presbyterian Church (1831–32) and the Custom House (1833–42) in New York City. One of the original elements that Davis evolved at this time was a window type he later called Davisean—vertically unified, multistoried, and often recessed windows.
