Sir Kenneth Branagh, in full Sir Kenneth Charles Branagh   (born December 10, 1960, Belfast, Northern Ireland) Irish-born English stage and motion-picture actor, director, and writer who is best known for his film adaptations of Shakespearean plays.
At age nine Branagh moved with his family from Northern Ireland to London. He began acting in school plays and graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1981. Six weeks later he made his professional stage debut. In 1984 he joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), where he received acclaim for his performances in Hamlet and Henry V. Often compared to Laurence Olivier (whom he would later portray), Branagh was noted for his magnetic and often whimsical performances. In 1987 he left the RSC to cofound the Renaissance Theatre Company, for which he served as actor, writer, and director.
