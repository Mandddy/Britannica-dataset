Electric catfish, any of about 18 widely distributed freshwater catfish species native to tropical Africa belonging to two genera (Malapterurus and Paradoxoglanis) of the family Malapteruridae. The best known of this group is M. electricus, a thickset fish with six mouth barbels and a single fin (the adipose fin) on its back, just anterior to the rounded tail fin. It is brownish or grayish, irregularly spotted with black, and attains a length and weight of about 1.2 metres (4 feet) and 23 kilograms (51 pounds).
M. electricus is capable of generating and controlling the discharge of up to 450 volts of electricity. It uses its power to defend itself and to capture prey. The electric organ is composed of modified muscle tissue and forms a fine, gelatinous layer directly beneath the soft, naked skin of the fish. The electric catfish is hardy and, though pugnacious, is sometimes kept in home aquariums. It was pictured on tombs by the ancient Egyptians.
