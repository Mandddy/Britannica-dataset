Conquistador, (
        Spanish: “conqueror”) , plural conquistadores or conquistadors,  any of the leaders in the Spanish conquest of America, especially of Mexico and Peru, in the 16th century.
An expedition against Aztec Mexico was led by Hernán Cortés, who set up a base camp at Veracruz in 1519 to prepare for an advance inland. Cortés marched inland with about 400 men and secured an alliance with the independent city of Tlaxcala, with whose aid he conquered the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City). Between 1522 and 1524, Michoacán and the Pacific coastal regions were conquered, and in 1524, expeditions led by Pedro de Alvarado and Cristóbal de Olid, respectively, were sent to Mayan Guatemala and the Gulf of Honduras.
