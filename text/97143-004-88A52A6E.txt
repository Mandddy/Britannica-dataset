William Brennan, in full William Joseph Brennan, Jr.  (born April 25, 1906, Newark, N.J., U.S.—died  July 24, 1997, Arlington, Va.) associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1956–90).
Brennan was the son of William Joseph Brennan, an Irish immigrant who was a brewery worker and union organizer, and Agnes McDermott Brennan. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1928 and then studied law under Felix Frankfurter at Harvard University, where he received a law degree in 1931. After graduation, he joined a Newark, N.J., law firm and specialized in labour law. His practice was interrupted by service in the U.S. Army during World War II, in which he rose to the rank of colonel, but after the war he returned to Newark to practice law. In 1949 Brennan was appointed to the newly created New Jersey Superior Court by Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll, and the following year he was named to the appellate division. In 1952 he was elevated to the state Supreme Court. Brennan’s service on the state bench was marked by his administrative skill in speeding litigation and clearing a calendar severely in arrears. Despite being a Democrat, Brennan was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Republican Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower in October 1956. A recess appointment, he was formally nominated to the Supreme Court in January 1957 and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by voice vote on March 19.
