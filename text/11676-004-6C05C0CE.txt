Christopher Fry, original name Christopher Harris   (born December 18, 1907, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England—died June 30, 2005, Chichester, West Sussex) British writer of verse plays.
Fry adopted his mother’s surname after he became a schoolteacher at age 18, his father having died many years earlier. He was an actor, director, and writer of revues and plays before he gained fame as a playwright for The Lady’s Not for Burning (1948), an ironic comedy set in medieval times whose heroine is charged with being a witch. A Phoenix Too Frequent (1946) retells a tale from Petronius Arbiter. The Boy with a Cart (1950), a story of St. Cuthman, is a legend of miracles and faith in the style of the mystery plays. A Sleep of Prisoners (1951) and The Dark Is Light Enough (1954) explore religious themes. After many years of translating and adapting plays—including Ring Round the Moon (produced 1950; adapted from Jean Anouilh’s L’Invitation du château), Duel of Angels (produced 1963; adapted from Jean Giraudoux’s Pour Lucrèce), and Peer Gynt (produced 1970; based on Johan Fillinger’s translation of Henrik Ibsen’s play)—Fry wrote A Yard of Sun, which was produced in 1970.
