John Wilkinson,  (born 1728, Clifton, Cumberland, Eng.—died  July 14, 1808, Bradley, Staffordshire) British industrialist known as “the great Staffordshire ironmaster” who found new applications for iron and who devised a boring machine essential to the success of James Watt’s steam engine.
At the age of 20 Wilkinson moved to Staffordshire and built Bilston’s first iron furnace. It was at his father’s factory at Bersham, Denbigh, Wales, that he constructed his new machine (1775) that could bore engine cylinders and cannon barrels with unequaled accuracy. Its precision enabled Watt to perfect his steam engine. Wilkinson, in turn, used the first steam engine built by Watt and James Moulton to drive a large air pump in his large-scale manufacture of wrought iron at Broseley, Shropshire.
