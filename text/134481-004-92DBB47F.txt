Sanjar, in full Muʿizz al-Dīn Sanjar  (born 1084/86—died  May 8, 1157) Seljuq prince of Khorāsān from c. 1096 to 1157, whose fame almost eclipses that of the “Great Seljuqs” because of the length of his reign, his power and victories in its first half, his disasters in the second, and the fact that he was the last real Seljuq sultan in Iran.
Appointed governor of Khorāsān by his half brother Berk-yaruq, who succeeded Malik-Shāh as sultan, Sanjar in fact acted as an independent prince throughout his reign and after the death of his full brother Muhammad in 1118 was regarded as the head of the Seljuq house. His longevity saved Khorāsān from the internecine struggles that destroyed the other Seljuq lines and enabled him to maintain an organized government in spite of the growing dangers that gathered around him.
