Abū al-Faraj al-Iṣbahānī, in full Abū al-Faraj ʿAlī ibn al-Ḥusayn al-Qurashī al-Iṣbahānī, also called al-Iṣfahānī  (born 897, Eṣfahān, Iran—died November 20, 967, Baghdad) literary scholar who composed an encyclopaedic and fundamental work on Arabic song, composers, poets, and musicians.
Abū al-Faraj was a descendant of Marwān II, the last Umayyad caliph of Syria. Despite the enmity between this family and the ʿAlids, he was a Shīʿite Muslim, upholding the rights of the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law ʿAlī to the caliphate. Abū al-Faraj spent most of his life in Baghdad, where he enjoyed the patronage of the Būyid amirs.
