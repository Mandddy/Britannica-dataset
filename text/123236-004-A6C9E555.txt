Klebsiella (genus Klebsiella), any of a group of rod-shaped bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Klebsiella organisms are categorized microbiologically as gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, nonmotile bacteria. Klebsiella organisms occur in soil and water and on plants, and some strains are considered a part of the normal flora of the human gastrointestinal tract. The genus is named for German physician and bacteriologist Edwin Klebs.
Klebsiella pneumoniae, also called Friedländer’s bacillus, was first described in 1882 by German microbiologist and pathologist Carl Friedländer. K. pneumoniae is best known as a pathogen of the human respiratory system that causes pneumonia. The disease is usually seen only in patients with underlying medical problems such as alcoholism or chronic pulmonary disease and often arises as a nosocomial infection (infection occurring in association with invasive treatment or long-term care in hospitals or other community health-care settings).
