Eugen Sandow, original name Friedrich Wilhelm Müller  (born April 2, 1867, Königsberg, Prussia [now Kaliningrad, Russia]—died October 14, 1925, London, England) physical culturist who, as a strongman, bodybuilder, and showman, became a symbol of robust manhood in fin de siècle England and America.
Sandow, after a brief period of study with the legendary strongman Louis Durlacher (“Professor Attila”), first attracted attention by breaking strength-testing machines in the cafés of Amsterdam. But his reputation was established in a series of challenge matches against the leading strongmen of the 1880s, including Charles Sampson, Frank (“Cyclops”) Bienkowski, and Henry (“Hercules”) McCann. His match with McCann in 1890 served as a model for later strongman competitions.
