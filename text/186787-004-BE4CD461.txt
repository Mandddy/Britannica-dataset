Maureen O’Hara, byname of Maureen FitzSimons  (born August 17, 1920, Rathmines and Rathgar township, County Dublin, Ireland—died October 24, 2015, Boise, Idaho, U.S.) Irish-American actress known for her portrayals of willful women.
FitzSimons was the second of six children born to the manager of a hat manufacturer and his wife, a fashion designer and sometime opera singer and actress. She began acting as a child, and, after a series of victories in amateur acting contests, she was hired to perform plays on the Irish national radio station. In 1934 she was accepted to the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, where she spent the following three years. While having dinner at a hotel, she was noticed by American singer Harry Richman, who recommended her for a screen test at a London film studio. The test was seen by English actor Charles Laughton, and he and his business partner, Erich Pommer, signed her to a seven-year contract with their production company, Mayflower Pictures. Having previously delivered only a single line in Kicking the Moon Around (1938; U.S. title, The Playboy), FitzSimons graduated to a slightly larger role in My Irish Molly (1938; U.S. title, Little Miss Molly).
