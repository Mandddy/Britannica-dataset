Dammar, also spelled damar, or dammer,  any of a variety of hard varnish resins obtained from coniferous and hardwood trees characteristic of Southeast and East Asia. These include the conifer genus Agathis (family Araucariaceae), such flowering plants as Shorea (especially S. wiesneri) and other genera of the family Dipterocarpaceae, and a few species of the family Burseraceae. The resin obtained from S. wiesneri oozes from the tree in a soft viscous state. It is highly aromatic but loses its odour as it hardens upon exposure to form a transparent, brittle, straw-coloured film. Dammar is readily soluble in alcohol. It is much-esteemed in Asia for incense burning and is also used in plasters, varnishes, and lacquers. Rapid-drying lacquers are formulated using dammar in combination with nitrocellulose. A solution of dammar in chloroform or xylene is used to preserve and mount thin biological sections for microscopic examination. With oil of turpentine, dammar forms a fine varnish that dries clear, smooth, and hard; it is a widely used picture varnish.
