Calotes, genus of arboreal (tree-dwelling) lizards of the family Agamidae, remarkable for their extreme colour changes when excited. It is found in gardens and forests of India, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and some Pacific islands. The taxonomy is uncertain, however, and about 21 species, differing primarily in scale arrangement, are recognized. These lizards range in total length from 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 inches), and their diet is made up of insects and other small invertebrates.
Calotes is typically green or brown, and the body is flattened in a horizontal direction. Colour patterns are variable, but males are more brightly coloured than females. Males of C. mystaceus are predominantly gray; however, the head, the neck, and the front part of the body are green. A light-coloured stripe runs along the upper jaw to extend down the first third of the body. In contrast, C. calotes is green with white bands just behind the front legs that extend from the dorsal scales to the edges of the chest. A dorsal crest of enlarged scales extends from the back of the head to the tail, but the largest scales occur on the head and neck. The head and neck region in C. calotes is coloured orange in males. Also, long hind and forelegs facilitate movement on vertical surfaces, such as tree trunks.
