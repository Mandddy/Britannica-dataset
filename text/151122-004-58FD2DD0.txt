Johann Friedrich Miescher,  (born August 13, 1844, Basel, Switzerland—died August 26, 1895, Davos) Swiss student of cell metabolism and discoverer of nucleic acids.
In 1869, while working under Ernst Hoppe-Seyler at the University of Tübingen, Miescher discovered a substance containing both phosphorus and nitrogen in the nuclei of white blood cells found in pus. The substance, first named nuclein because it seemed to come from cell nuclei, became known as nucleic acid after 1874, when Miescher separated it into protein and acid components. It is now known as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
