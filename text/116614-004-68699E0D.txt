Loyola University Chicago, private, coeducational university in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. It is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Roman Catholic Church. Loyola University was founded in 1870 on the near west side of Chicago as St. Ignatius College by members of the Society of Jesus, a Roman Catholic order founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola. The school’s name was changed in 1909, and by 1923 the university had relocated to the far north side of the city along Lake Michigan. In 1991 the university subsumed neighbouring Mundelein College in northern Chicago and Mallinckrodt College in Wilmette; the Mallinckrodt campus, which had housed Loyola’s school of education, was sold in 2002. Loyola is one of the largest Roman Catholic universities in the United States, with a total enrollment of some 13,000 students.
Comprising numerous schools and colleges across four campuses, Loyola offers bachelor’s and master’s degrees in nearly 60 fields, doctoral degrees in more than 35 programs, and several professional degrees. Its Lake Shore campus, located on the north side of the city, contains the College of Arts and Sciences, the Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, the Graduate School, and the Institute of Pastoral Studies. St. Joseph Seminary is also on the campus. Loyola’s other Chicago campus, the Water Tower campus, is located downtown and was donated to the university in 1946; it contains schools of law, social work, education, professional studies, and business administration as well as the Institute for Human Resources and Industrial Relations. The Loyola University Medical Center, in suburban Maywood, contains the Stritch School of Medicine, the Loyola University Hospital, the graduate nursing program, and several clinical facilities. Since the early 1960s, the university has also operated an overseas campus in Rome. Research facilities at Loyola include the Center for Urban Research and Learning and the Center for Ethics and Social Justice.
