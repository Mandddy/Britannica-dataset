Alexander Calder,  (born July 22, 1898, Lawnton, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died November 11, 1976, New York, New York) American artist best known for his innovation of the mobile suspended sheet metal and wire assemblies that are activated in space by air currents. Visually fascinating and emotionally engaging, those sculptures—along with his monumental outdoor bolted sheet metal stabiles, which only imply movement—make Calder one of the most-recognizable and beloved modern artists. He also made a smaller number of sculptures in the more-traditional materials of wood and bronze and did paintings, mostly in gouache, as well as drawings, including illustrations for books, and prints, and was an inventive designer of jewelry.
Calder was the son and grandson of artists—his mother was the painter Nanette Calder (née Lederer; 1866–1960), his father the sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder (1870–1945), and his grandfather sculptor Alexander Milne Calder (1846–1923). Initially Calder resisted “going into the family business.” His extraordinary manual dexterity, evidenced by his boyhood tinkering with hand tools in the creation of toys and other objects, recommended him to a potential career in engineering. After a peripatetic childhood, relocating from Pennsylvania to Arizona, California, and New York as necessitated by his father’s commissions and teaching positions, 17-year-old Calder enrolled in the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, and received a degree in mechanical engineering in 1919. In 1922, while serving aboard a ship off Central America, he had a formative experience of viewing, on opposite horizons, both the rising sun and the setting moon, opening him to ideas about the vast but precise workings of the universe that later informed both his choice of subject matter and formal decisions such as his focus on balance and movement. While he worked at various jobs in his first chosen field, by 1923 Calder had decided to study art and had enrolled in classes at the Art Students League in New York City.
