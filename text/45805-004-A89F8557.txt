Saint Andrey Rublyov,  (born c. 1360–70—died c. 1430; canonized 1988; feast day January 29) one of the greatest medieval Russian painters, whose masterpiece is a magnificent icon of “The Old Testament Trinity,” now in the Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.
Little is known of his life except that he was the assistant of another great painter called Theophanes the Greek, who came to Russia from Constantinople. Fairly late in life, Rublyov became a monk, first at Trinity-St. Sergius at Sergiyev Posad and then at the Andronikov monastery in Moscow. Russian painters did not sign their works until the 17th century, so paintings can be assigned to him only on the basis of written evidence or of style. Written evidence associates with his name wall paintings at Vladimir and Moscow and the panel, or icon, of “The Old Testament Trinity.” By analogy of style a number of other icons can also be attributed to him, the chief of these being panels of St. John the Baptist, St. Paul, St. Peter and the Ascension, done in 1408 for the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin at Vladimir, and others of the Archangel Michael and the Saviour from Zvenigorod, now in the Tretyakov Gallery.
