Lancelot Andrewes,  (born 1555, London, Eng.—died  Sept. 26, 1626, London) theologian and court preacher who sought to defend and advance Anglican doctrines during a period of great strife in the English church.
Andrewes was elected a fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1575 and was ordained a deacon in 1580. His service to several parishes from 1589 was followed by consecration as bishop of Chichester in 1605 and his transfer to Ely in 1609 and to Winchester in 1619; he had earlier refused the sees of Salisbury and Ely because Elizabeth I had insisted that he cooperate with the crown in reducing the power of the church. Under James I and Charles I he was lord almoner (1605–19) and dean of the chapels royal (1619–26). A master of rhetoric, he earned a reputation as an eloquent and learned court preacher.
