Nick Nolte, in full Nicholas King Nolte  (born February 8, 1941, Omaha, Nebraska, U.S.) American actor known for playing dysfunctional leading roles, often characters with tough exteriors and secret complex sensitivities.
Nolte spent much of his childhood moving from town to town with his family. Eventually they settled back in his native Omaha, Nebraska, where he was active in high-school sports. He subsequently attended Arizona State University on a football scholarship but flunked out after one semester. Nolte went on to attend several different colleges, though he never earned a degree. In the early 1960s he landed in California and took a manual-labour job in Los Angeles. It was about this time that he first became interested in theatre, and he began his stage career at the Pasadena Playhouse. In 1963 he joined a theatre group in Phoenix. For the next decade Nolte performed with repertory companies, traveling throughout the United States.
