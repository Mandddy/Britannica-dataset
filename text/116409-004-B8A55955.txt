Brant, also called Brent Goose,   (Branta bernicla), water bird that resembles small, short-necked forms of the Canada goose but is much darker and, though black-necked and black-headed, lacks white cheeks; instead it has a more or less extensive narrow white neck ring and is “bibbed” like the barnacle goose. It breeds in the Arctic and winters southward into Eurasia and North America. See also barnacle goose.
