Battle of the Wilderness, (May 5â€“7, 1864), in the American Civil War, the first stage of a carefully planned Union campaign to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. Crossing the Rappahannock River near Fredericksburg, Virginia, early in May, General Ulysses S. Grant advanced with a Union army of 115,000 men. On May 5 he met a Confederate army of 62,000 troops under General Robert E. Lee. The confrontation occurred in dense thickets, called the Wilderness, where orderly movement was impossible and cavalry and artillery were almost useless. Burning brush killed many of the wounded. After indecisive but intense fighting for two days, Grant saw the futility of further hostilities in that area and moved on to do battle at Spotsylvania Court House, nearer Richmond.
