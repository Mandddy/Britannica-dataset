Menno Simons, in full Menno Simonszoon, Simons also spelled Simonsz.  (born 1496, Witmarsum, Friesland [Netherlands]—died January 31, 1561, near Lübeck, Holstein [Germany]) Dutch priest, an early leader of the peaceful wing of Dutch Anabaptism, whose followers formed the Mennonite church.
Little is known about Menno’s early life. He was born into a Dutch peasant family, and his father’s name was Simon. At an early age he was enrolled in a monastic school, possibly at the Franciscan monastery in Bolsward, to prepare for the priesthood. In March 1524, at the age of 28, he was ordained at Utrecht and assigned to the parish at Pingjum, near the place of his birth. Seven years later he became the village priest in his home parish at Witmarsum.
