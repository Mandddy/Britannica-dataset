Mel Tormé, in full Melvin Howard Tormé  (born September 13, 1925, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died June 5, 1999, Los Angeles, California) American singer, songwriter, composer, arranger, pianist, drummer, actor, and author, one of the 20th century’s most versatile, respected, and influential jazz vocalists.
Tormé began singing professionally when he was just 4 years old. At age 6 he was in vaudeville, at 8 he starred on radio, and at 15 he composed his first hit, “Lament to Love.” Tormé began touring with Chico Marx’s band just before he turned 17, and in 1943 he made his motion picture debut in Higher and Higher. The same year he formed a quintet, Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones. Such other films as Good News (1947) and Words and Music (1948) followed, and Tormé became an idol of bobby-soxers. “Blue Moon,” which he sang in Words and Music, became his first solo hit and one of his signature tunes. In 1949 Capitol Records chose Tormé’s California Suite for its first long-playing album, and in 1954 he recorded Mel Tormé at the Crescendo, his first live album. With the rise of rock music, Tormé’s career faltered, but it rebounded in the late 1970s. Eventually Tormé earned two Grammy Awards for best male jazz vocalist, for the albums An Evening with George Shearing and Mel Tormé (1982) and Top Drawer (1983). His performing career lasted until he suffered a stroke in 1996.
