Entelodont (family Entelodontidae), any member of the extinct family Entelodontidae, a group of large mammals related to living pigs. Entelodonts were contemporaries of oreodonts, a unique mammalian group thought to be related to camels but sheeplike in appearance. Fossil evidence points to their emergence in the Middle Eocene (some 49 million to 37 million years ago) of Mongolia. They spread across Asia, Europe, and North America before becoming extinct sometime between 19 million and 16 million years ago during the early Miocene Epoch.
Entelodonts were medium-size to very large animals. The smallest ones grew to about 150 kg (about 330 pounds; the size of a large male white-tailed deer), whereas the largest ones, such as Dinohyus, weighed 900 kg (about 2,000 pounds; roughly the size of a Clydesdale horse). The skulls of entelodonts were also proportionally large, accounting for about 35 to 45 percent of the animalâ€™s total length in Dinohyus. Entelodonts had distinctive tusklike projections of bone that grew out from the skull. These structures were related to the musculature and movements of the jaw during feeding, and they also might have protected sensitive areas of the head.
