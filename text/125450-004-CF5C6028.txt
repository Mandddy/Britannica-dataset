Nichiren, original name Zennichi, also called Zenshōbō Renchō, posthumous name Risshō Daishi   (born March 30, 1222, Kominato, Japan—died  Nov. 14, 1282, Ikegami) militant Japanese Buddhist prophet who contributed significantly to the adaptation of Buddhism to the Japanese mentality and who remains one of the most controversial and influential figures in Japanese Buddhist history. After an exhaustive study of the various forms of Buddhism, he concluded (in 1253) that the Lotus Sūtra teaching was the only true doctrine suitable for his age and predicted calamity for Japan if all other sects were not banished. He wrote his systematic work, Kaimokushō (1272), while in exile for his radical teachings.
Nichiren, the son of a fisherman, was born in the village of Kominato, on the Pacific coast of the present Bōsō Peninsula in eastern Japan. When he was 11 years old, he entered the Buddhist monastery of Kiyosumi-dera, near Kominato, and after four years of novitiate received the Buddhist orders. Buddhism in Japan had become more and more doctrinally confused, and the identity of the various sects was based more on institutional aspects than on doctrinal tenets. Though the monastery of Kiyosumi-dera officially belonged to the Tendai sect (which was centred on the Lotus Sūtra text and realization of the universal Buddha-nature), the doctrine practiced there was a mixture of different Buddhist schools; it had a strong emphasis on Shingon, an esoteric school that emphasized an elaborate symbolic ritual as a means of arousing an immediate sense of the all-pervading presence of the Buddha.
