Yi Sun-shin, also spelled Yi Sun-sin   (born April 28, 1545, Seoul, Korea [now in South Korea]—died  Dec. 16, 1598, off Noryang) Korean admiral and national hero whose naval victories were instrumental in repelling Japanese invasions of Korea in the 1590s.
After passing the government examinations to become a military officer in 1576, Yi served at various army and navy posts. Although he was twice discharged after being falsely accused by jealous colleagues, in 1591 he was appointed commander of the naval forces in Left Chŏlla province, where he concentrated on training his men, stocking equipment and supplies, and developing the renowned kŏbuksŏn (“turtle ship”). The kŏbuksŏn is thought to have been the first ironclad battleship in history. Its upper deck was covered with armoured plates to protect its crew, and spikes and knives were attached to the plates to discourage enemies from boarding. The ship’s bow was equipped with a dragon head through which cannon could be fired and clouds of smoke could be emitted to obscure the ship’s position. Cannon and guns could also be fired from the stern and the sides of the ship.
