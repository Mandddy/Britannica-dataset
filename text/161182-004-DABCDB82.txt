P.L. Travers, in full Pamela Lyndon Travers, original name Helen Lyndon Goff  (born August 9, 1899, Maryborough, Queensland, Australiaâ€”died April 23, 1996, London, England) Australian English writer known for her Mary Poppins books, about a magical nanny. The books insightfully explored the fraught relationship between children and adults through a combination of mythological allusion and biting social critique.
Goff was known to have embroidered upon her life at various points, which complicates any retelling of it. She romanticized her jocular and charismatic father as the Irish-born owner of a sugar plantation. (He himself had claimed to be from Ireland.) In fact, he was an English-born bank manager, eventually demoted to clerk. Following his death in 1907, Goff moved with her mother and two sisters to Bowral, New South Wales, Australia, where they were supported by a maternal great aunt.
