Kumaraswami Kamaraj,  (born July 15, 1903, Virudunagar, Indiaâ€”died October 2, 1975, Madras [now Chennai]) Indian independence activist and statesman who rose from humble beginnings to become a legislator in the Madras Presidency (an administrative unit of British India that encompassed much of southern India), chief minister (head of government) of the successor Madras state in independent India (now largely occupied by Tamil Nadu state and also including portions of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala states), and president of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party).
Kamaraj was born in what is now southern Tamil Nadu to a family of the Nadar (next-to-lowest) caste. His father, a coconut merchant, died when Kamaraj was a young boy. When he was 12 years old, he dropped out of school and began working in a cloth shop. He soon found himself drawn to the Indian independence movement against British rule and began attending public meetings held by local Congress Party leaders and later volunteering in various capacities (e.g., organizing fund-raising rallies for the party in his home district).
