Drottningholm Theatre, Swedish Drottningholmsteater,  18th-century court theatre of the Royal Palace of Drottningholm, near Stockholm, Swed. It is preserved with its original sets and stage machinery as a theatrical museum.
Built in the 1760s by the architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, it was the home of several French and Swedish acting companies and prospered especially during the enlightened reign of the playwright-king Gustav III (reigned 1771–92). After the king’s death it was used as a storeroom. This fortunate neglect resulted in its preservation. In 1921 it was cleaned and restored. Among the items preserved are Baroque scenery designed by Carlo Bibiena and Louis-Jean Desprez and some stage machinery in working condition, such as a device for simulating waves designed according to Nicola Sabbatini’s theatre manual of 1638. The theatre is now used for period operas in the summertime. It was used as a setting in Ingmar Bergman’s film Trollflöjten (1975; “The Magic Flute”).
