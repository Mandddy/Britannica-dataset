Rick Mercer, byname of Richard Vincent Mercer  (born October 17, 1969, St. John’s, Newfoundland [now Newfoundland and Labrador], Canada) Canadian satirist, comedian, actor, and writer whose insightful lampooning of Canadian politics made him a national icon.
Mercer grew up in an exurb of St. John’s in a middle-class family that loved to discuss politics. While in high school (which he departed one credit short of graduation), he wrote and performed in an award-winning one-act play and cofounded Corey and Wade’s Playhouse, a theatre troupe that performed around St. John’s. In 1990 he won praise for Show Me the Button, I’ll Push It (or, Charles Lynch Must Die), the one-person show he first presented as an angry young man of 21. After touring with it and, later, another one-man show, I’ve Killed Before, I’ll Kill Again, in 1993 Mercer began an eight-season run on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in This Hour Has 22 Minutes, an inventive sketch-comedy-based television show he created with several fellow Newfoundlanders.
