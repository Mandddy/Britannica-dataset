Marie Van Zandt,  (born October 8, 1858, probably Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died December 31, 1919, Cannes, France) American opera singer who achieved major European success in a career marked by dramatic heights and depths.
Van Zandt was apparently taken to Europe as a small child by her mother, who pursued a successful career as a concert and operatic singer under the name Madame Vanzini. Marie soon displayed vocal abilities as well, and her mother abandoned her own career in order to promote that of her daughter. Van Zandt received encouragement from Adelina Patti and made her singing debut in a production of Mozart’s Don Giovanni in Turin, Italy, early in 1879. In May of that year she made her London debut in Vincenzo Bellini’s La sonnambula (The Sleepwalker). Her Paris debut followed in March 1880 in an Opéra-Comique production of Ambroise Thomas’s Mignon. Her performance there won her a five-year contract, and she attained popular stardom with dizzying speed. The height of her Paris career came in April 1883, when she created the title role in Lakmé, which Leo Delibes reportedly wrote for her.
