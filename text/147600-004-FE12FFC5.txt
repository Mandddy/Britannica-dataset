Francis Beaumont,  (born c. 1585, Grace-Dieu, Leicestershire, England—died March 6, 1616, London) English Jacobean poet and playwright who collaborated with John Fletcher on comedies and tragedies between about 1606 and 1613.
The son of Francis Beaumont, justice of common pleas of Grace-Dieu priory, Charnwood Forest, Leicestershire, Beaumont entered Broadgates Hall (later Pembroke College), Oxford, in 1597. His father dying the following year, he abruptly left the university without a degree and later (November 1600) entered London’s Inner Temple, where he evidently became more involved in London’s lively literary culture than in legal studies.
