Sam Cooke, byname of Samuel Cook  (born Jan. 22, 1931, Clarksdale, Miss., U.S.—died Dec. 11, 1964, Los Angeles, Calif.) American singer, songwriter, producer, and entrepreneur. Cooke was a major figure in the history of popular music and, along with Ray Charles, one of the most influential black vocalists of the post-World War II period. If Charles represented raw soul, Cooke symbolized sweet soul. To his many celebrated disciples—Smokey Robinson, James Taylor, and Michael Jackson among them—he was an icon of unrivaled stature.
Cooke’s career came in two phases. As a member of the groundbreaking Soul Stirrers, a premier gospel group of the 1950s, he electrified the African American church community nationwide with a light, lilting vocal style that soared rather than thundered. “Nearer to Thee” (1955), “Touch the Hem of His Garment” (1956), and “Jesus, Wash Away My Troubles” (1956) were major gospel hits and, in the words of Aretha Franklin, “perfectly chiseled jewels.”
