Sambal,  in Indonesian and Malaysian cuisine, a spicy relish served as a side dish. The basic sambal consists of fresh chilis, shrimp paste (trassi), lime juice, sugar, and salt. Though most sambals are uncooked, a sambal goreng is fried. Numberless variations can be created by the addition of vegetables, fruits, meats, and additional seasonings, notably ketjap manis, a sweet, spiced soy sauce.
