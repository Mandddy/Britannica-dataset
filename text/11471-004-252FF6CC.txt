Ellen Glasgow, in full Ellen Anderson Gholson Glasgow  (born April 22, 1873, Richmond, Va., U.S.—died  Nov. 21, 1945, Richmond) American novelist whose realistic depictions of life in her native Virginia helped direct Southern literature away from sentimentality and nostalgia.
Glasgow, the daughter of a wealthy and socially prominent family with Old Virginia roots on her mother’s side, was educated mainly at home because of her delicate health. In 1897 she anonymously published her first novel, The Descendant. It was followed by Phases of an Inferior Planet (1898). With The Voice of the People (1900) she began a series of novels depicting, with what she intended to be Zolaesque realism, the social and political history of Virginia since 1850. The series continued in The Battle-Ground (1902), The Deliverance (1904), The Romance of a Plain Man (1909), The Miller of Old Church (1911), Virginia (1913), Life and Gabriella (1916), and One Man in His Time (1922). Other books of that period were The Wheel of Life (1906), The Ancient Law (1908), The Builders (1919), and The Shadowy Third and Other Stories (1923).
