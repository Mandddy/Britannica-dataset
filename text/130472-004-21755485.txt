Alan Moore,  (born November 18, 1953, Northampton, England) British writer whose works included some of the most influential books in comics history.
Moore entered the publishing industry in the early 1970s, working as a writer and artist for a number of independent magazines. He broke into the mainstream with stories for Doctor Who Weekly and the science-fiction anthology series 2000 ad, but his gift for deconstructing the superhero genre first appeared in 1982, when he resurrected the classic British hero Marvelman (called Miracleman in the United States) for the magazine Warrior. Moore imagined Marvelman as a middle-aged reporter who had forgotten his role as the worldâ€™s preeminent superhero, and later stories examined how an individual with godlike powers would interact with human society.
