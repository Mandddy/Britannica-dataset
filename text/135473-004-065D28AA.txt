Jacobus Hercules de la Rey, de la Rey also spelled Delarey   (born 1847, near Winburg, Orange River Sovereignty [now in South Africa]—died  Sept. 15, 1914, Johannesburg) a talented and popular Boer leader in the South African War (1899–1902).
De la Rey gained military experience in the Transvaal’s attacks on African groups and represented Lichtenburg in the Volksraad (parliament), opposing Pres. Paul Kruger. On the outbreak of the South African War in 1899, de la Rey became a general and fought in the western campaign. On July 1, 1900, he assumed full charge of operations in the western Transvaal, and he was conspicuously successful in guerrilla operations. Later, however, de la Rey supported peace, believing that a fight to the end would weaken the Transvaal’s bargaining position.
