Skara Brae,  one of the most perfectly preserved Stone Age villages in Europe, which was covered for hundreds of years by a sand dune on the shore of the Bay of Skaill, Mainland, Orkney Islands, Scot. Exposed by a great storm in 1850, four buildings were excavated during the 1860s by William Watt. After another storm in 1926, further excavations were undertaken by the Ancient Monuments branch of the British Ministry of Works. Archaeologists estimated that Skara Brae had been built c. 2000 bcâ€“1500 bc.
Though the dwellings at Skara Brae are built of undressed slabs of stone from the beach, put together without any mortar, the drift sand that filled them immediately after their evacuation preserved the walls in places to a height of eight feet. Because there were no trees on the island, furniture had to be made of stone and thus also survived. The village consisted of several one-room dwellings, each a rectangle with rounded corners, entered through a low, narrow doorway that could be closed by a stone slab.
