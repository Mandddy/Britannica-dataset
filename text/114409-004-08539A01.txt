Transylvanian Saxons, German-speaking population that in the Middle Ages settled in Transylvania, then part of Hungary. The Transylvanian Saxons represented one of the three nations that made up the Transylvanian feudal system. Their region was called the Szászföld (Hungarian: Saxon Lands) or Királyföld (Royal Lands). A small population of Saxons continues to live in Transylvania, now part of Romania.
In the 12th century King Géza II of Hungary (reigned 1141–62) invited Germans to settle and defend relatively sparsely populated Transylvania. The people who arrived were in fact not all Saxons; they came from the whole of the German-speaking region and also included Walloons. The first group of immigrants settled in southern Transylvania, in the region of Nagyszeben (present-day Sibiu, Rom.). The existing inhabitants of the area were moved elsewhere, thereby creating a homogeneous German-speaking region (the Altland). Later settlers moved into the surrounding areas inhabited by Magyars (Hungarians) and Romanians.
