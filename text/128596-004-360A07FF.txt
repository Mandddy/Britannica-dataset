Game, in gastronomy, the flesh of any wild animal or bird. Game is usually classified according to three categories: (1) small birds, such as the thrush and quail; (2) game proper, a category that can be subdivided into winged game, such as the goose, duck, woodcock, grouse or partridge, and pheasant; and ground game, such as the squirrel, hare, and rabbit; (3) big game, predominantly venison, including roebuck, deer, elk, moose, and caribou but also including other large animals such as bear and wild boar.
In general, game is drawn and allowed to cool after being killed and then hung for several days. Whether or not game birds should be drawn is a debated issue. A common practice is not to draw birds with slender, tapering beaks, such as the thrush or corncrake.
