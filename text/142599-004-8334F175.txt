Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, wildlife preserve in south-central Kerala state, southern India. The sanctuary is noted for herds of Asian elephants, sometimes having 50 members. In addition, bonnet monkeys, nilgai (Indian antelope), langurs, porcupines, sloth bears, tigers, leopards, barking deer, gray jungle fowl, kingfishers, great Indian hornbills, and southern grackles are found in the preserve. Extending over an area of 297 square miles (770 square km), the sanctuary encompasses Periyar Lake, formed in the early 1900s by impounding the Periyar River, and is located near the Keralaâ€“Tamil Nadu border about 73 miles (118 km) south of Ernakulam and 170 miles (274 km) northeast of Thiruvananthapuram. At an elevation of about 4,600 feet (1,600 metres), the hilly topography has produced a lakeshore varied by numerous creeks, bays, and promontories. The vegetal cover is tropical evergreen and deciduous, with patches of dense forest including jackfruit, teak, and kokam (tropical evergreen [Garcinia indica]) trees that produce a dark purple, plumlike fruit). Most of the grassland is now planted with eucalyptus.
