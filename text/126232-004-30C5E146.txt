Bowls, also called lawn bowls ,  outdoor game in which a ball (known as a bowl) is rolled toward a smaller stationary ball, called a jack. The object is to roll one’s bowls so that they come to rest nearer to the jack than those of an opponent; this is sometimes achieved by knocking aside an opponent’s bowl or the jack. A form of bowls was played in ancient Egypt, and by the Middle Ages the game was well known in continental Europe. The International Bowling Board, the ruling body of lawn bowls, was founded in 1905.
Bowls is generally played on a flat lawn, about 40–42 yards (37–38 metres) square and surrounded by a shallow ditch and grass banks beyond. The green is divided into six rectangular sections, or rinks, each of which is about 18–21 feet (5.5–6.4 metres) wide. The bowls are also called woods, though they may be made of rubber, wood, or some other material. Bowls measure from 4.75 to 5.75 inches (12 to 14.5 cm) in diameter and have a maximum weight of 3.5 pounds (1.5 kg). They are black or brown in colour. They are also biased, or flattened on one side, so that they follow a curved course when rolled. The jack is white in colour, weighs 8 to 10 ounces (0.2 to 0.3 kg), and has a diameter of 2.5 inches (6.3 cm). Players deliver their bowls from a rubber mat of 24 by 14 inches (61 by 36 cm).
