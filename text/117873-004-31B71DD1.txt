Michigan State University, public, coeducational institution of higher learning in East Lansing, Mich., U.S. It was a pioneer among land-grant universities and is a noted institution of research. Through its more than a dozen colleges it provides comprehensive undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs. The university has long been active in plant science studies and operates a plant research laboratory with the U.S. Department of Energy. Other research and public service facilities include the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, a centre for continuing education in business, and centres and institutes for international studies, economic development, and environmental toxicology. Also on campus is the W.J. Beal Botanical Garden (created 1873), one of the oldest facilities of its kind in North America.
Chartered in 1855 by the state legislature, Michigan State University opened in 1857 as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, the first agricultural college in the United States. It is considered the prototype for the land-grant colleges created under the aegis of the Morrill Act of 1862. The botanist Liberty Hyde Bailey established the country’s first horticultural laboratory at the school in 1888. The school’s original focus on agricultural and mechanical arts later expanded, and its name changed four times before 1964, when it received its present name.
