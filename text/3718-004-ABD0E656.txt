Redshank, either of two species of Old World shorebirds of the family Scolopacidae (order Charadriiformes), characterized by its long reddish legs. In the common redshank (Tringa totanus), about 30 cm (12 inches) long, the legs are orange-red, the upper parts are brownish or gray, the rump and hind edge of the wing are white, and the upturned bill is reddish with a black tip. The common redshank nests in wet meadows in Iceland, Britain, much of continental Europe, the Middle East, and temperate Asia (to 4,500 metres [about 15,000 feet] in the Himalayas), and it winters from Africa to the Philippines. The slightly larger spotted redshank (T. erythropus), also called dusky or black redshank, has reddish brown legs and a straight red bill with a brown tip. In breeding season, its plumage is black; in winter, gray. It breeds across sub-Arctic Eurasia and winters from the Mediterranean region into southern Asia.
