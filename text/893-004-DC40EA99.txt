George II, in full George Augustus, German Georg August, also called (1706–27) marquess and duke of Cambridge   (born Nov. 10 [Oct. 30, Old Style], 1683, Herrenhausen Palace, Hanover—died Oct. 25, 1760, London) king of Great Britain and elector of Hanover from 1727 to 1760. Although he possessed sound political judgment, his lack of self-confidence caused him to rely heavily on his ministers, most notable of whom was Sir Robert Walpole.
George Augustus was the only son of the German prince George Louis, elector of Hanover (King George I of Great Britain from 1714 to 1727), and Sophia Dorothea of Celle. He grew up in Hanover and married (1705) the beautiful and intelligent Caroline of Ansbach. Upon the accession of his father to the English throne he was designated prince of Wales. By 1717 George I and his son, who had for years detested each other, were quarrelling openly. The prince’s London residence, Leicester House, became the gathering place for a dissident Whig group headed by Walpole and Viscount Charles Townshend. The tepid reconciliation that took place between George I and the prince in 1720 led to the inclusion of Walpole in George I’s administration, and Walpole lost the prince’s favour when he became one of George I’s leading ministers. The prince, upon his accession as George II, would have dismissed Walpole from office had not Caroline intervened on the minister’s behalf.
