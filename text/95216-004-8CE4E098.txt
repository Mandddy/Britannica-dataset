Isobar, line on a weather map of constant barometric pressure drawn on a given reference surface. The isobaric pattern on a constant-height surface is extremely useful in weather forecasting because of the close association between pressure and weather. Regions of low pressure at sea level tend to be areas of bad weather, especially in winter. At higher elevations the wind blows approximately parallel to the isobars, with low pressure to the left in the Northern Hemisphere and to the right in the Southern Hemisphere with respect to the direction of air movement; the closer together the isobars are, the stronger the wind speed. Only sea-level pressure patterns are routinely used in meteorology. At higher elevations pressure itself is used to define the reference surface upon which contours of the height above sea level are drawn; dynamically, the height contours of a constant pressure surface are completely analogous to the isobars of a constant-height surface.
