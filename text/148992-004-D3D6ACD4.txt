Michael Ondaatje, in full Philip Michael Ondaatje  (born September 12, 1943, Colombo, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]) Canadian novelist and poet whose musical prose and poetry are created from a blend of myth, history, jazz, memoirs, and other forms.
Ondaatje immigrated to Montreal when he was 19 and received a B.A. in English from the University of Toronto in 1965 and an M.A. from Queen’s University in 1967. His first collection of poetry, The Dainty Monsters (1967), is a series of lyrics that juxtapose everyday life with mythology. It was praised for its unique blend of primitive and domestic imagery. Ondaatje’s fascination with the lore of the American West led to one of his most celebrated works, the 1970 pastiche The Collected Works of Billy the Kid: Left-Handed Poems. Often called a parable of the artist as outlaw, the work contains poems, prose, photographs, interviews, and even comic books, which combined create a meditation on the nature of heroism and violence. His collection titled Secular Love (1984) contains poetry about the breakup of his marriage. His other poetry collections include The Cinnamon Peeler (1989) and Handwriting: Poems (1998).
