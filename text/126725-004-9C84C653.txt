Herbert Matter,  (born April 25, 1907, Engelberg, Switzerland—died  May 8, 1984, Southampton, New York, U.S.) Swiss-born American photographer and graphic designer known for his pioneering use of photomontage in commercial art.
Matter studied with the painters Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant in Paris, where he later assisted the graphic artist Cassandre and the architect Le Corbusier. His own international reputation was firmly established during the mid-1930s, when he made travel posters for the Swiss National Tourist Office in Zürich. These posters were among the earliest effective uses of photomontage, the technique of constructing a picture from parts of more than one photograph.
