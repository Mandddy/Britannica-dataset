Juan Luis Vives,  (born March 6, 1492, Valencia, Aragon, Spain—died  May 6, 1540, Brugge [now in Belgium]) Spanish humanist and student of Erasmus, eminent in education, philosophy, and psychology, who strongly opposed Scholasticism and emphasized induction as a method of inquiry.
Vives left Spain at the age of 17 to avoid the Inquisition. After studies at Paris (1509–12), he was appointed professor of the humanities at Leuven (Louvain [1519]). Having dedicated his commentary (1522) on St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei to Henry VIII of England, he went in 1523 to England, where he was appointed preceptor to Mary, princess of Wales, and lectured on philosophy at Oxford. In 1527 he forfeited Henry’s favour by opposing the royal divorce from Catherine of Aragon and was imprisoned for six weeks, after which he left England for the Netherlands to devote himself to writing.
