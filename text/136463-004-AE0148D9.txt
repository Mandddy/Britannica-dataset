Mishmi,  tribal people mostly of Arunachal Pradesh (formerly North East Frontier Agency) in extreme northeastern India, near Tibet and Assam, speaking dialects of the Tibeto-Burman linguistic family. Numbering about 35,000 in the late 20th century, the Mishmi live along the valleys of the Dibang (where they are known as Midu) and Luhit rivers. Those of the Luhit Valley are divided into two groups, the Miju on the upper Luhit and the Digaru on that riverâ€™s lower reaches.
The Mishmi trace their descent through the paternal line, and young people are expected to marry outside the paternal clan. Settlements are small and frequently shifted. There are no chiefs. Each family group is virtually autonomous and inhabits a longhouse built on piling.
