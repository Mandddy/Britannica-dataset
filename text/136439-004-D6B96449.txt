Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui,  also called Pachacutec   (flourished 15th century) Inca emperor (1438–71), an empire builder who, because he initiated the swift, far-ranging expansion of the Inca state, has been likened to Philip II of Macedonia. (Similarly, his son Topa Inca Yupanqui is regarded as a counterpart of Philip’s son Alexander III the Great.)
Pachacuti first conquered various peoples in what is now southern Peru and then extended his power northwesterly to Quito, Ecuador. He is said to have devised the city plan adopted for his capital, Cuzco (in present southern Peru). He also maintained royal estates for mummified past rulers.
