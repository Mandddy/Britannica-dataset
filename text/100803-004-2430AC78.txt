Sulfur butterfly (subfamily Coliadinae), any of a group of butterflies in the family Pieridae (order Lepidoptera) that are bright yellow or orange and have a wingspan of 35 to 60 mm (1.5 to 2.5 inches). Sexual and seasonal dimorphism in pattern and colour occur in many species. The pupae are attached to a twig by a posterior spine and a girdle of silk.
Some species have two colour patterns. For example, the alfalfa butterfly (Colias eurytheme) is usually orange with black wing margins, but some females are white with black margins. The larvae feed on clover and may seriously damage crops, including alfalfa and soybeans.
