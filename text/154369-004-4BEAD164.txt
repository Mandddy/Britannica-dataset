Sutton Foster, in full Sutton Lenore Foster  (born March 18, 1975, Statesboro, Georgia, U.S.) American actress and singer whose high-spirited charisma and brightly expressive voice brought her fame in Broadway musical theatre. She won Tony Awards for her lead roles in Thoroughly Modern Millie (2002) and Anything Goes (2011).
Foster grew up in Georgia, where her father worked for General Motors. She was an energetic child and began taking dance lessons at age four. Six years later she landed the starring role in a community theatre production of the musical Annie. In 1992, after having moved with her family to suburban Detroit, she was cast in the ensemble of a national touring production of The Will Rogers Follies. Foster then studied theatre at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for a year (1993–94) before resuming her stage career in a national tour of Grease; she later joined the show’s Broadway cast as a replacement. Small roles on Broadway in Annie, The Scarlet Pimpernel, and Les Misérables followed. Between those productions, Foster performed a lead part in What the World Needs Now: A Musical Fable, a showcase for the songs of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, during its world-premiere run in San Diego in 1998.
