Henry George Liddell,  (born Feb. 6, 1811, Bishop Auckland, County Durham, Eng.—died  Jan. 18, 1898, Ascot, Berkshire) British lexicographer and co-editor of the standard Greek–English Lexicon (1843; 8th ed., 1897; revised by H.S. Jones and others, 1940; abridged, 1957; intermediate, 1959). In 1834 he and a fellow student at Oxford, Robert Scott, began preparing the Lexicon, basing their work on the Greek–German lexicon of Francis Passow, professor at the University of Breslau.
A tutor at Balliol College, Oxford (1836–45), Liddell was ordained in the Church of England (1838) and in 1846 was appointed domestic chaplain to Prince Albert. He was headmaster of Westminster School prior to serving as dean of Christ Church, Oxford (1856–91). He devoted much of his spare time to revising and enlarging the Lexicon. He also wrote a History of Ancient Rome, 2 vol. (1855), abridged in 1871 under the title The Student’s Rome: A History of Rome from the Earliest Times to the Establishment of the Empire. It was for Liddell’s daughter Alice that Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland.
