August Bournonville,  (born Aug. 21, 1805, Copenhagen, Den.—died  Nov. 30, 1879, Copenhagen) dancer and choreographer who directed the Royal Danish Ballet for nearly 50 years and established the Danish style based on bravura dancing and expressive mime.
He studied under his father, Antoine Bournonville, one of the major dancers of his day, before going to Paris for further training under Auguste Vestris and Pierre Gardel. After appearances at the Paris Opéra and in London, Bournonville returned to Copenhagen as soloist and choreographer for the Royal Danish Ballet. In 1836 he staged his own version of La Sylphide, a ballet by Filippo Taglioni, with his pupil and protégée, Lucile Grahn, in the title role. Many of Bournonville’s more important ballets were based on observations he made while on tour. Napoli (1842), for example, was inspired by a trip to Italy; Bruges (1851) revealed his interest in Flemish art of the 17th century; Wedding in Hardanger (1853) was inspired by visits to Norway; and From Siberia to Moscow (1876), his last ballet, was the result of a trip to Russia. Ballets set in Spain (The Toreador and La Ventana), Austria (In the Carpathians), and the Orient (Abdallah) and imagined dances from around the world (Far From Denmark) were matched by those that celebrated Denmark (Valdemar, sometimes referred to as the Danish national ballet, and A Folk Tale among them). His Konservatoriet (1849) is the only surviving ballet to show classical dance exercises as practiced in the classroom in the early 19th century.
