Étienne-Louis Boullée,  (born February 12, 1728, Paris, France—died February 6, 1799, Paris) French visionary architect, theorist, and teacher.
Boullée wanted originally to be a painter, but, following the wishes of his father, he turned to architecture. He studied with J.-F. Blondel and Germain Boffrand and with J.-L. Legeay and had opened his own studio by the age of 19. He designed several Parisian city mansions in the 1760s and ’70s, notably the Hôtel de Brunoy (1774–79). Despite the innovative Neoclassicism of his executed works, Boullée achieved a truly lasting influence as a teacher and theorist. Through his atelier passed such masters as Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart, Jean-Franƈois-Thérèse Chalgrin, Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand, and Louis-Michel Thibault. In all, he taught for more than 50 years.
