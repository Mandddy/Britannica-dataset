Magic Johnson, byname of Earvin Johnson, Jr.  (born August 14, 1959, Lansing, Michigan, U.S.) American basketball player who led the National Basketball Association (NBA) Los Angeles Lakers to five championships.
The son of an autoworker, Johnson earned his nickname “Magic” in high school for his creative and entertaining ballhandling. He was an intense competitor who led his high school team to a state championship in 1977 and led Michigan State University to the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship in 1979—handing Larry Bird and Indiana State its only defeat of that season. Johnson left Michigan State after his sophomore season and was selected by the Lakers with the first overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft.
