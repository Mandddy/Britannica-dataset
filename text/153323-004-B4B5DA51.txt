Miami University, public, coeducational institution of higher learning in Oxford, Ohio, U.S. The university is composed of seven academic divisions and emphasizes a core curriculum in the liberal arts. It offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in the liberal arts, sciences, and business administration. Miami has branch campuses in nearby Middletown (1966) and Hamilton (1968) that award associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees and professional certificates in several areas. There is also a European centre in Luxembourg.
An act of the U.S. Congress in 1792 required that a university be established in the Miami River valley north of the Ohio River. Although the university was officially chartered in 1809, instruction did not begin until 1824. Financial shortfalls forced Miami to close in 1873, but it reopened in 1885 with the support of the state of Ohio. Women were first admitted in 1888.
