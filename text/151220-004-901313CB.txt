Orbit, in astronomy, path of a body revolving around an attracting centre of mass, as a planet around the Sun or a satellite around a planet. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton discovered the basic physical laws governing orbits; in the 20th century, Albert Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity supplied a more exact description.
The orbit of a planet is, if unaffected by the attraction of another planet, elliptical; some elliptical orbits are very nearly circles, while others are much elongated. Some bodies may follow parabolic or hyperbolic paths (open-ended curves). The orbit of a body approaching the solar system from a very great distance, curving once around the Sun, and receding again is such an open curve.
