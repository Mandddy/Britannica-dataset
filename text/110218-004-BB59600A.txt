Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, German Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung,  museum located in Berlin, Ger., noted for possessing one of the world’s leading collections of artifacts and texts of ancient Egypt.
It began in the 18th century as part of the Prussian royal art collection and steadily expanded through gifts, contributions, and finds. The museum was heavily damaged during World War II and, after the war, was divided between East Berlin and West Berlin. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collection was reunited to once again constitute one of the finest records of ancient Egypt, containing more than 45,000 artifacts and 60,000 texts.
