USB, in full universal serial bus,  technology used to connect computers with peripherals, or input/output devices.
First introduced in 1995, the USB standard was developed by a number of American companies, including IBM, Intel Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation, as a simpler way of connecting hardware to personal computers (PCs). Before USB technology a PC typically would have one or two serial ports, a parallel port, mouse and keyboard ports, and, in some cases, a joystick port. A USB port represented a standardized way to connect a wide range of devices while offering significant advantages in speed over other connection types.
