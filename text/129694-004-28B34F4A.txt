Colorado River, river rising in western Texas, U.S., on the Llano Estacado (“Staked Plain”) in Dawson county, northeast of Lamesa. It flows generally southeastward past Colorado City, through rolling prairie and rugged hill and canyon country. By means of the Highland Lakes, six reservoirs—Buchanan, Inks, Lyndon B. Johnson, Marble Falls, Travis, and Austin—impounded by as many dams, the river flows past Austin and across the Coastal Plain to enter Matagorda Bay (an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico) after a course of some 862 miles (1,387 km). The Colorado is the largest river lying entirely within Texas; it drains an area of about 39,900 square miles (103,350 square km) and receives several forks of the Concho River, the Pecan Bayou, and the San Saba, Llano, and Pedernales rivers. Its system of dams and reservoirs provides several important flood-control, power, irrigation, and recreational projects. Notable among the many recreational facilities is the Colorado River Trail, which links the various cultural and recreational features of 11 counties, from San Saba to Matagorda, that are joined by the river.
