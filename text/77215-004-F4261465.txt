John Schlesinger, in full John Richard Schlesinger  (born February 16, 1926, London, England—died July 25, 2003, Palm Springs, California, U.S.) English film director known for a wide variety of sensitively told stories set in his homeland and in the United States.
Schlesinger’s father was a pediatrician, and both of his parents were accomplished musicians who encouraged his interest in the arts. He received a home movie camera as a gift at age 11, and, while serving in the Royal Engineers during World War II, he made films on the war’s front line. He also entertained his fellow troops by performing magic tricks, and after his tour of duty he continued making short films and acted in stage productions while studying at the University of Oxford. He toured the United States, Australia, and New Zealand with theatrical troupes in the early 1950s, and he acted in British theatre, cinema, and television, including roles in the films Oh…Rosalinda! (1955) and The Battle of the River Plate (1956) by the noted filmmaking team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
