Jean-Gilbert-Victor Fialin, duke de Persigny,  (born Jan. 11, 1808, Saint-Germain-Lespinasse, France—died  Jan. 12, 1872, Nice) French statesman who helped pave the way for Louis-Napoléon’s rise to power as the emperor Napoleon III.
Born of a petty noble family, he served in the hussars from 1825 to 1831, when he was dismissed for participation in a political rebellion. Thereafter he devoted himself to the restoration of the empire and to the cause of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte. He was active in the latter’s attempted coups in 1836 and 1840 and in his eventual election to the presidency in 1848. He was then appointed aide-de-camp to Louis-Napoléon and was simultaneously deputy for Loire (1849–51), enjoying an important backstairs influence.
