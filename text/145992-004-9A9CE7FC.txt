Baldassarre Peruzzi,  (born Jan. 15, 1481, Anciano, Republic of Siena [Italy]—died Jan. 6, 1536, Rome) Sienese architect and painter, one of the earliest artists to attempt illusionist architectural painting (quadratura), the extension of real architecture into imaginary space.
Peruzzi was a contemporary of Raphael and Donato Bramante. He began his career as a painter of frescoes in the Cappella San Giovanni in Siena’s cathedral. His first architectural work was the Villa Farnesina in Rome (1509–21), and he also assisted in the fresco decoration of this palace. On Raphael’s death, in 1520, Peruzzi was appointed one of the architects for St. Peter’s in Rome.
