Stunt flying, the performance of aerial feats requiring great skill or daring.
Stunt flying as a generic term may include barnstorming (see below), crazy flying (the performance of comedic aerial routines), or any spectacular or unusual flying feat performed for film or television cameras or for any kind of public display or entertainment. Stunt flying may be performed by one or more pilots at the same time and with almost any kind of flying craft (including parachutes and gliders, as well as the more usual powered airplanes). While in the early days the term was given to the extreme combat maneuvers performed by aircraft in World Wars I and II and to aerobatic flying (before the latter developed into a sport), these usages have fallen away.
