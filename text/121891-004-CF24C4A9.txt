Rondane National Park, Norwegian Rondane Nasjonalpark,  park in south-central Norway established as a nature preserve in December 1962 by royal decree; by a law of 1970 the area became a national park. The park covers an area of 221 square miles (572 square km), with a range of elevation of from 3,000 to 7,000 feet (900 to 2,100 metres).
The terrain is mountainous, with a large part of its area comprising impressive peaks, the highest being Rondeslottet, at 7,146 feet (2,178 metres). Vegetation is comparatively sparse because of the poor, dry soil, and the few trees scattered about the landscape are mostly dwarf birch and conifers. Lichens (especially reindeer moss) predominate nearer the ground, giving the mountains a yellowish-white colour. The most noticeable flowering plant is the glacier crowfoot, a buttercup.
