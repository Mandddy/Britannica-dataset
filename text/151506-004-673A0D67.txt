Sarah Jessica Parker,  (born March 25, 1965, Nelsonville, Ohio, U.S.) American actress who was perhaps best known for her role on the television series Sex and the City (1998–2004).
Parker took ballet and acting classes as a child, and at age 11, she moved with her family to New York City so that she and her siblings could pursue careers in entertainment. In 1978 she landed the lead role in Broadway’s Annie, and she stayed with the musical for some three years. Other stage work followed, and in 1979 she made her film debut in Rich Kids. In 1982 Parker portrayed a high-school nerd in the television series Square Pegs. Although the show lasted only one season, it developed a cultlike following and led to several film offers, including Footloose (1984) and Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985). Parker continued her work in the theatre, appearing in The Heidi Chronicles (1989); The Substance of Fire (1991); Sylvia (1995), for which she earned critical praise for her portrayal of a dog; and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1996). In the latter play she appeared with her longtime boyfriend, Matthew Broderick; the couple married in 1997.
