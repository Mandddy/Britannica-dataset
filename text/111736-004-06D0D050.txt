Fannie Lou Hamer, née Townsend   (born Oct. 6, 1917, Ruleville, Miss., U.S.—died March 14, 1977, Mound Bayou, Miss.) African-American civil rights activist who worked to desegregate the Mississippi Democratic Party.
The youngest of 20 children, Fannie Lou was working the fields with her sharecropper parents at the age of six. Amid poverty and racial exploitation, she received only a sixth-grade education. In 1942 she married Perry (“Pap”) Hamer. Her civil rights activism began in August 1962, when she answered a call by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) for volunteers to challenge voter registration procedures that excluded African-Americans. Fired from her job for her activism, she became a field secretary for SNCC and a registered voter in 1963.
