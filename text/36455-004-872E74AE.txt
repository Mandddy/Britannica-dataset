Ksawery Drucki Lubecki,  (born Dec. 28, 1779, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  May 23, 1846, St. Petersburg) Polish statesman who restored the finances of the remnant of Poland that was constituted as the “Congress Kingdom” under the tsar of Russia after the Napoleonic Wars.
A member of a princely family descended from the ancient Russian ruling house of Rurik, Lubecki began his career as an officer in the Russian army. From 1813 to 1815 he was a member of the provisional government of the Russian-occupied Duchy of Warsaw; later (1817–21) he successfully negotiated in Berlin and Vienna the settlement of the Polish foreign debt.
