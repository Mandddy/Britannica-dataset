Shipworm, also called pileworm,  any of the approximately 65 species of marine bivalve mollusks of the family Teredidae (Teredinidae). Shipworms are common in most oceans and seas and are important because of the destruction they cause in wooden ship hulls, wharves, and other submerged wooden structures.
Only a small part of the anterior end of the shipworm is covered by a shell; the remainder is a long tubelike structure that, in some species, may be 180 cm (6 feet) long. The white shell, often marked with closely set lines, is used for burrowing into wood. File-like ridges on the shell cut into the wood at a rate of about 8 to 12 rasping motions a minute. Shipworms secrete lime to line the inside of the burrow. The tubelike portion of the animal, which extends back to the burrow opening, ingests food particles and oxygen from the water and discharges wastes and reproductive cells. A certain amount of wood is also ingested as food by most species.
