Palazzo Farnese, Roman palace that serves as an important example of High Renaissance architecture. It was designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and built between 1517 and 1589. In 1546, when Sangallo died, leaving the building of the palace unfinished, Michelangelo was appointed by Pope Paul III, who was a member of the Farnese family, to complete the work.
Michelangelo is responsible for the balcony, the large coat of arms, the windows of the upper story, and the cornice of the main facade, as well as for the upper story of the cortile, or main courtyard, which is more Mannerist than High Renaissance in style. The interior is decorated with frescoes by Annibale Carracci. The palace now houses the French embassy.
