Frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii), type of reptile found in Australia and New Guinea. The frilled lizard can run standing up on its hind legs with its forelegs and tail in the air. The scaly membrane around its neck is used as a large part of the lizardâ€™s defensive posture. Normally, the neck frill, often as wide as the lizard is long, lies like a cape over the shoulders. When the lizard is irritated or threatened, it can raise the frill perpendicular to its body, enabling it to surprise its enemies by suddenly displaying a head several times its normal size.
Chlamydosaurus kingii averages 85 cm (33 inches) in length and spends most of its time in trees feeding on insects and small mammals.
