Weight throw, sport of throwing a weight for distance or height. Men have long matched strength and skill at hurling objects. The roth cleas, or wheel feat, reputedly was a major test of the ancient Tailteann Games in Ireland. The competition consisted of various methods of throwing: from shoulder or side, with one or two hands, and with or without a run. The implements used varied widely in weight and conformation. Early in the 20th century, records were listed for throwing weights of 14, 28, 35, and 56 pounds (6.3, 12.7, 15.9, and 25.4 kg) for both distance and height. Weight throwing is distinct from the shot put and the discus throw and from the present-day hammer throw.
In 1904 and 1920, 56-pound weight-throwing contests for distance were included as an athletics event in the Olympic Games. Ã‰tienne Desmarteau (Canada) won the 1904 competition with a throw of 10.46 metres (34 feet 4 inches), and Pat MacDonald (United States) won in 1920 with a heave of 11.26 metres (36.93 feet). In 1914 P. Donovan (United States) set a world record for throwing the 56-pound weight for height with a distance of 5.17 metres (16.96 feet). By the second half of the 20th century, there no longer was any international competition in weight throwing, and performances did not receive world-record listing by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world governing body of track and field.
