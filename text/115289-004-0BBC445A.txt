Gordon River, river in southwestern Tasmania, Australia. The Gordon River rises from Lake Richmond in the King William Range of the central highlands and flows southeast around a great bend to the southwest and finally northwest to enter the Indian Ocean at Macquarie Harbour after a course of 115 miles (185 km). Its principal tributaries are the Franklin, Serpentine, Wedge, Denison, and Sprent rivers. The largely inaccessible mountains in which the Gordon rises give way to rainforests in the lower valley, where valuable Huon pines with a high oil content are cut for milling. Explored in 1816 by James Kelly, who named it after James Gordon, an associate, the river is navigable by small steamers only in its lowest 20 miles (32 km). Launches ply the stream during the summer, leaving from Strahan on the north shore of Macquarie Harbour.
The first stage of the Gordon River hydroelectric project was completed in 1978; Gordon Dam and dams on the Serpentine and Huon rivers have created Lakes Gordon and Pedder, the former of which is one of the largest freshwater storage reservoirs in Australia. Lake Gordon has a surface area of 105 square miles (272 square km) and a storage capacity of 399,621,000,000 cubic feet (11,316,000,000 cubic m). Lake Pedder has a surface area of 93 square miles (242 square km). With the lower Gordon River as their immediate concern, environmentalists protested against the effect of future dams on wilderness areas. A major conservation controversy ensued, and in 1983 the national government intervened to prevent the construction of another dam on the Gordon River at a site below its junction with the Franklin. Much of the watershed is within Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness UNESCO World Heritage site (designated 1982).
