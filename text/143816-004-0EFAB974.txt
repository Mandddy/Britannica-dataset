Water glass, also called sodium silicate or soluble glass,  a compound containing sodium oxide (Na2O) and silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2) that forms a glassy solid with the very useful property of being soluble in water. Water glass is sold as solid lumps or powders or as a clear, syrupy liquid. It is used as a convenient source of sodium for many industrial products, as a builder in laundry detergents, as a binder and adhesive, as a flocculant in water-treatment plants, and in many other applications.
Water glass has been manufactured since the 19th century, and the basic principles of making “silicate of soda” have not changed since that time. It is commonly produced by roasting various quantities of soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) and silica sand (a ubiquitous source of SiO2) in a furnace at temperatures between about 1,000 and 1,400 °C (approximately 1,800 and 2,500 °F), a process that gives off carbon dioxide (CO2) and produces sodium silicate (Na2SiO3; usually represented by its two constituents, Na2O and SiO2):Na2CO3 + SiO2→ Na2O∙SiO2 + CO2
