Laval University, French Université Laval,  a French-language university located on the outskirts of the city of Quebec. Laval’s predecessor institution, the Seminary of Quebec, considered the first Canadian institution of higher learning, was founded by François de Montmorency Laval, first Roman Catholic bishop of Quebec, in 1663. Queen Victoria granted the seminary a university charter in 1852, and it was recognized by a papal bull in 1872. In 1970 the university was reorganized and given a new charter by the national assembly of Quebec. Laval currently carries on an active educational exchange with French-language universities in Africa and Europe. Numerous scientific research institutes are affiliated with the university.
