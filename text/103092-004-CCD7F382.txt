United Service Organizations, Inc. (USO), formerly (1941–51) United Service Organizations for National Defense, Inc.,  private, nonprofit social-service agency first chartered on February 4, 1941, to provide social, welfare, and recreational services for members of the U.S. armed forces and their families.
First proposed by Gen. George C. Marshall in 1940 to enhance the quality of life and morale of servicemen, the USO was established, at his urging, by representatives of the Salvation Army, the YMCA, the National Board of the YWCA, the National Jewish Welfare Board, the National Catholic Community Service, and (from March 1941) the Travelers Aid Association of America. USO service clubs and recreational centres began appearing in the summer of 1941, and USO Camp Shows, Inc., was incorporated in November 1941 to provide celebrity entertainment for military commands overseas and at home (especially, later, at veterans’ hospitals). In June 1943 the USO had its peak number of volunteers (739,000) and in March 1944 its peak number of recreational clubs (3,035); in July 1944 it handled 661,000 cases of travelers’ aid.
