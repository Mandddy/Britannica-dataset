Stonefly (order Plecoptera), any of about 2,000 species of insects, the adults of which have long antennae, weak, chewing mouthparts, and two pairs of membranous wings. The stonefly ranges in size from 6 to more than 60 mm (0.25 to 2.5 inches). The hindwings are generally larger and shorter than the forewings and fold like a fan when not in use. Even though its wings are well developed, the stonefly is a poor flier. Many species are gray, black, or brown and blend into their surroundings.
The life history of the stonefly is not well known. Each female may produce as many as 6,000 eggs, which are dropped in masses into a stream. The stonefly nymph resembles the adult but lacks wings and may have external gills on various parts of its body. The nymph feeds on plants, decaying organic matter, and other insects. The nymphal stage lasts from one to four years, and the adults live several weeks.
