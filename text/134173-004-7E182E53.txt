John Brown,  (born 1735, Buncle, Berwickshire, Scot.—died  Oct. 17, 1788, London) British propounder of the “excitability” theory of medicine, which classified diseases according to whether they had an over- or an understimulating effect on the body.
Brown studied under the distinguished professor of medicine William Cullen at the University of Edinburgh, but was forced to receive his M.D. from St. Andrews (1779) because of his unpopularity with his colleagues. It was while studying with Cullen that Brown began to develop his theory, which held that all living tissues are “excitable” and postulated that the state of life is dependent on certain internal and external “exciting powers,” or stimuli, that operate on it. Brown viewed diseases as states of either decreased or increased excitability, and generally prescribed stimulants for the former condition and sedatives for the latter. His recommended treatments often consisted of wine or laudanum.
