Mikhail Khodorkovsky,  (born June 26, 1963, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) Russian oil tycoon and, at one time, the richest man in Russia, who was imprisoned in 2003 on charges of fraud and tax evasion.
Khodorkovsky, the son of a Jewish father and a Christian mother, was born to a middle-class family. Both of his parents were chemical engineers, and they instilled in their son a fascination with chemistry. He graduated from the Moscow D. Mendeleyev Institute of Chemical Technology in 1986 and was an active member of the Komsomol and the Communist Party. After he was rejected as a candidate for graduate school, he turned to business. Under the liberalized economic policies of Mikhail Gorbachevâ€™s perestroika program, private entrepreneurship was encouraged, and Khodorkovsky enlisted the help of his Mendeleyev Institute and Komsomol colleagues on a number of enterprises.
