Anna Hyatt Huntington, original name Anna Vaughn Hyatt  (born March 10, 1876, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.—died October 4, 1973, Redding, Connecticut) American sculptor who brought great subtlety and vividness to equestrian and animal subjects.
Anna Hyatt Huntington was the daughter of noted Harvard paleontologist Alpheus Hyatt. She was educated privately and began her study of sculpture with Henry Hudson Kitson in Boston. She later attended the Art Students League in New York City. In 1900 Hyatt had her first one-woman exhibition, held in Boston, where she showed some 40 characteristic pieces—animal figures, delicately and accurately modeled and endowed with a lifelike spirit. In 1903 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York made its first of many acquisitions (Winter Noon, 1902) of her sculpture. In 1907 she traveled to France, and for a year she occupied a studio in Auvers-sur-Oise. She showed at the Paris Salon and in 1910 won honourable mention there for her equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, replicas of which were erected in New York in 1915 and subsequently in several other cities, both in the United States and in Europe. She became a member of the National Academy of Design (now the National Academy Museum) in 1916.
