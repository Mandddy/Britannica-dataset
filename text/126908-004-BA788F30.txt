Glenn Miller, original name in full Alton Glen Miller  (born March 1, 1904, Clarinda, Iowa, U.S.—died  Dec. 16, 1944, at sea en route from London to Paris) American big band leader, arranger, composer, and trombonist, considered the premier musical symbol of the World War II generation.
Miller began studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder, but he left to work as a musician. He played for several bands before being hired as a trombonist with Ben Pollack’s orchestra in the mid-1920s. From 1928 to 1936, Miller worked as a freelance musician, contributing his arrangements and trombone playing to the bands of Red Nichols, the Dorsey brothers, Benny Goodman, Ray Noble, and Smith Ballew. In 1935 he studied with the music theorist Joseph Schillinger, who proved influential in Miller’s development of the instrumentation that was an important component in his later success. Miller formed his first band in 1937; it attracted little notice, but some of its recordings were admired by critics, especially Miller’s arrangement of “I Got Rhythm,” with its use of countermelody and multiple false endings.
