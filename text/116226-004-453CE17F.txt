Ed Sullivan, byname of Edward Vincent Sullivan  (born Sept. 28, 1901, New York City—died Oct. 13, 1974, New York City) master of ceremonies of a popular early U.S. television variety program first known as “Toast of the Town” (1948–55) and later as “The Ed Sullivan Show” (1955–71). Presenting diverse kinds of entertainment acts, “The Ed Sullivan Show” was telecast by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Sullivan was noted—and teased—for his terse way of introducing guest performers; his usually reserved manner won him the sobriquet “the Great Stone Face.”
The son of a New York City customs inspector, Sullivan started in journalism as a sportswriter. He joined the New York Daily News in 1932 and became a Broadway columnist for that paper. He became known for his talent at discovering and publicizing interesting new performers. CBS hired him after photographing him at work as master of ceremonies of a promotional Harvest Moon ball sponsored by the Daily News. On the first “Toast of the Town” show he introduced a concert pianist, a boxing referee, and a singing fireman, as well as such celebrities as the composer and librettist Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II and the comedians Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The program was enormously popular for more than two decades.
