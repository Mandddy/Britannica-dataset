Alice Brown,  (born Dec. 5, 1856, Hampton Falls, N.H., U.S.—died June 21, 1948, Boston, Mass.)  American novelist, short-story writer, and biographer who gained some note as a writer of local colour.
Brown graduated from Robinson Seminary in nearby Exeter in 1876. She then taught school for several years while contributing short stories to various magazines. Her success as a writer allowed her to give up teaching and move to Boston in 1884. She joined the staff of the Christian Register and in 1885 that of the Youth’s Companion, with which she was associated for some years. Her first novel, Stratford-by-the-Sea, was published in 1884.
