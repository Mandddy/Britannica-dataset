Jack Benny, original name Benjamin Kubelsky   (born Feb. 14, 1894, Chicagoâ€”died  Dec. 27, 1974, Beverly Hills, Calif., U.S.) entertainer whose unusual comedic method and expert timing made him a legendary success in U.S. radio and television for more than 30 years.
Benny Kubelsky was reared in Waukegan, a small city north of Chicago, where his father operated a saloon and later a dry goods store. As a boy he helped out in the store and took up the violin, and by his high school years had become proficient with the instrument. He played it in vaudeville from 1912, and in 1918 when he was taken into the U.S. Navy he was assigned to entertainment duties. It was there that his comic talent came to light and, while he remained a competent violinist in private, on stage his violin soon became little more than a prop which he played ineptly for comic effect.
