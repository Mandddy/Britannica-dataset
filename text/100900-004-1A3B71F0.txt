Ōkubo Toshimichi,  (born Sept. 26, 1830, Kagoshima, Japan—died  May 14, 1878, Tokyo) Japanese politician and one of the samurai leaders who in 1868 overthrew the Tokugawa family, which had ruled Japan for 264 years, and restored the government of the emperor. After the Meiji Restoration he spent much of his career helping to establish Japan as a progressive nation.
Ōkubo early showed great political acumen and became one of the leading figures in the government of Satsuma, one of the largest and most powerful Japanese feudal domains and a hotbed of anti-Tokugawa sentiment. Although Chōshū, another powerful domain, shared the anti-Tokugawa stand of Satsuma, they were on unfriendly terms with each other. This situation was remedied in 1866, when Ōkubo and Saigō Takamori, another leading figure in the Satsuma government, agreed to an alliance with Chōshū in which both domains determined to cooperate against the Tokugawa.
