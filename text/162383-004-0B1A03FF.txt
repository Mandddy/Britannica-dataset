Irish water spaniel, breed of sporting dog developed in Ireland in the 1830s for retrieving game; its ancestors were other curly coated water retrievers. The Irish water spaniel has a distinctive liver-coloured (brown-red) curly coat that covers everything except its face and “rat” tail and forms a characteristic topknot that falls over the top of its head and ears. The coat sheds water and protects the dog in cold weather when swimming to retrieve waterfowl in lakes or in marshy areas. The Irish water spaniel stands 21 to 24 inches (53 to 61 cm) and weighs 45 to 65 pounds (20 to 29 kg). The breed is known for its playful disposition and trainability. It was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1878.
