Hans Hofmann,  (born March 21, 1880, Weissenberg, Ger.â€”died  Feb. 17, 1966, New York, N.Y., U.S.) German painter who was one of the most influential art teachers of the 20th century. He was a pioneer in experimenting in the use of improvisatory techniques; his work opened the way for the first generation of post-World War II American painters to develop Abstract Expressionism.
Hofmann began to study art in Munich in 1898, but in 1904 he moved to Paris, where he was deeply affected by the expressive use of colour that distinguished the paintings of Henri Matisse and Robert Delaunay. He opened his first school of painting in Munich in 1915.
