Darién, geographic region of the easternmost Isthmus of Panama; it extends into northwestern Colombia, around the Gulf of Urabá (a section of the Gulf of Darién), and forms the physiographic link between Central and South America. A hot, humid area typified by tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps, and low mountain ranges with cloud forest vegetation, Darién has always been sparsely populated.
Darién was first reached by Europeans in 1501 and was seen by Christopher Columbus on his last voyage. The first successful European settlement on the mainland of the Americas, Santa María de la Antigua del Darién, was begun in 1510 on the western side of the Gulf of Urabá. From this colony Vasco Núñez de Balboa made his famous march to the Pacific Ocean in 1513. A few years later some colonists left the Darién settlement to found Panama City; eventually, Santa María was abandoned. Another short-lived attempt at colonization was made in the 17th century, when a Scottish trading company founded a settlement about halfway between Portobelo, Panama, and Cartagena, Colombia.
