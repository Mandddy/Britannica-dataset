Shinran, original name Matsuwaka-Maru, also called Han’en, Shakkū, Zenshin, or Gutoku Shinran, posthumous name Kenshin Daishi   (born 1173, near Kyōto, Japan—died  Jan. 9, 1263, Kyōto) Buddhist teacher recognized as the founder of the Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land School), which advocates that faith, recitation of the name of the buddha Amida (Amitabha), and birth in the paradise of the Pure Land. For centuries Jōdo Shinshū has been one of the largest schools of Buddhism in Japan. During his lifetime Shinran was an insignificant figure, but in the centuries after his death his fledging movement grew into an enormous religious organization that revered him as its founder. In modern times Shinran has been recognized as an eminent and sophisticated religious thinker.
The details of Shinran’s life are sketchy because few historical sources about him have survived. The most important of these, a hagiography (saint’s life) known popularly as the Godenshō (“The Biography”), was written in 1295 by his great-grandson Kakunyo (1270–1351). Other works that offer insights into his life are Shinran’s own religious writings and the letters of his wife, Eshin Ni (1182–1268?), which were discovered in 1921.
