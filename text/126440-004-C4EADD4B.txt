Point Reyes National Seashore, rugged peninsula extending into the Pacific Ocean northwest of San Francisco, northern California, U.S. It fronts the Pacific Ocean to the west, Drakes Bay to the south, and Tomales Bay to the northeast; the latter bay extends inland about 13 miles (21 km) along the San Andreas Fault zone. The national seashore, authorized in 1962 and established in 1972, covers an area of 111 square miles (288 square km). It is surrounded on the west and south by Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and borders a portion of Golden Gate National Recreation Area to the southeast.
The English explorer Sir Francis Drake landed on the peninsula, then inhabited by Coast Miwok Indians, in 1579; the site was named in 1603 by the Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno, who sailed past on the day of the Feast of the Three Kings and named it La Punta de los Reyes. Ranching began in the mid-19th century, and dairy farming has continued to the present day; Pierce Point Ranch is preserved as a remnant of 1850s agriculture.
