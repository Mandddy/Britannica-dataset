Shane Warne, in full Shane Keith Warne  (born Sept. 13, 1969, Ferntree Gully, Vic., Austl.) Australian cricketer who was one of the most effective bowlers in history, with good disguise on his top-spinner and fine control on two or three different googlies (balls bowled with fingerspin that break unexpectedly in the opposite direction from that anticipated). His success promoted the almost-forgotten art of leg-spin and brought variety to a sport that had been dominated by fast bowling. In 2006 he became the first bowler to take 700 Test wickets.
Warne came to cricket relatively late in his teenage years, and his relaxed manner, bleached hair, stud earring, and fondness for surfing made him a folk hero among young cricket fans around the world. He had played just seven matches in the Sheffield Shield domestic club competition before being selected for Australia, and he made his Test debut against India at Sydney in 1991–92. In the 1993 Ashes series against England, Warne took 34 wickets in six Tests at an average of 25.79. He was perhaps best remembered for one ball, bowled to England’s Mike Gatting at Old Trafford, Manchester, in the 1993 series. The ball was a perfect example of the leg-spinner’s art, pitching on leg stump and spinning viciously past the bat to hit Gatting’s off stump. It was Warne’s first ball in a Test in England and established a huge psychological advantage for Warne and the Australian team, which lasted into the next Ashes series in 1994–95. In that series Warne took 27 wickets at 20.33, including a match-winning 8 for 71 in the second innings of the first Test and a hat trick (three wickets on three balls) in the second Test.
