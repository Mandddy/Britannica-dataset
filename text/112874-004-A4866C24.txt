Trans-Canada Highway, principal highway of Canada and the world’s longest national road. The road extends west-east between the Pacific and Atlantic coasts across the breadth of the country for 4,860 miles (7,821 km), between Victoria (Vancouver Island, British Columbia) and St. John’s (Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador). It passes through all 10 Canadian provinces, links many of the country’s leading cities, and allows access to important national and provincial parks. Cape Breton Island, linked to mainland Nova Scotia by a causeway, is the easternmost point of the continuous land portion of the route, and car ferries provide the final connections to Vancouver Island and Newfoundland.
Authorized in 1949 by the Trans-Canada Highway Act, construction began the following year. The first province to complete its section was Saskatchewan, which did so in 1957. The full coast-to-coast highway was officially dedicated on September 3, 1962, at a ceremony on Rogers Pass in Glacier National Park, southeastern British Columbia. It was not until 1965, however, when a 200-mile (320-km) stretch was completed on Newfoundland, that motorists were able to drive the route in its entirety, and construction actually continued in various locations until 1971. Since then, further improvements have been made, notably replacement of two-lane portions of the route with multiple-lane divided roadways. In addition, other routes through portions of Quebec and Ontario, a northwestward branch from southern Manitoba to Prince Rupert in western British Columbia (via Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and Edmonton, Alberta), and a spur from New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island via a bridge across Northumberland Strait are also designated as part of the Trans-Canada Highway system.
