Oxide, any of a large and important class of chemical compounds in which oxygen is combined with another element. With the exception of the lighter inert gases (helium [He], neon [Ne], argon [Ar], and krypton [Kr]), oxygen (O) forms at least one binary oxide with each of the elements.
Both metals and nonmetals can attain their highest oxidation states (i.e., donate their maximum number of available valence electrons) in compounds with oxygen. The alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals, as well as the transition metals and the posttransition metals (in their lower oxidation states), form ionic oxides—i.e., compounds that contain the O2− anion. Metals with high oxidation states form oxides whose bonds have a more covalent nature. Nonmetals also form covalent oxides, which are usually molecular in character. A smooth variation from ionic to covalent in the type of bonding in oxides is observed as the periodic table is traversed from the metals on the left to the nonmetals on the right. This same variation is observed in the reaction of oxides with water and the resulting acid-base character of the products. Ionic metal oxides react with water to give hydroxides (compounds containing the OH− ion) and resultant basic solutions, whereas most nonmetal oxides react with water to form acids and resultant acidic solutions (see the table).
