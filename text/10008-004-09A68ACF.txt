Merlin (Falco columbarius), small falcon found at high latitudes throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Adult males have slate-blue backs with finely streaked underparts; females and immature birds have brown backs; all have a tail with narrow white bands.
During most of the year merlins inhabit open country ranging from marshlands to deserts, but many breed in conifer and birch woods. In open country eggs are laid in a scrape on the ground amid bushes, but in forested areas the tree nests of crows, rooks, or magpies are used. Its diet consists mainly of smaller birds that it catches in midair. Unlike the peregrine falcon, the merlin does not dive at prey but accelerates after it; rodents and insects are also eaten. An aggressive, fearless hunter, the merlin has long been used in falconry.
