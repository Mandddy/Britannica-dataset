Gaston Lachaise,  (born March 19, 1882, Paris, France—died Oct. 18, 1935, New York, N.Y., U.S.) French-born American sculptor known for his massively proportioned female nudes.
Lachaise was the son of a cabinetmaker. At age 13 he entered a craft school, where he was trained in the decorative arts, and from 1898 to 1904 he studied sculpture at the École des Beaux-Arts. He began his artistic career as a designer of Art Nouveau decorative objects for the French jeweler René Lalique. Having fallen in love with an American woman, Lachaise immigrated to the United States in 1906 and worked in Boston for H.H. Kitson, an academic sculptor of military monuments. In 1912 Lachaise went to New York City and worked as an assistant to the sculptor Paul Manship.
