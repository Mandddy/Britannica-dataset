Waiau River, formerly Waiau-ua, or Dillon,  river in eastern South Island, New Zealand. It rises in the Spenser Mountains and flows south and east for 105 miles (169 km) to enter the Pacific Ocean, 6 miles (10 km) northeast of Cheviot. Its generally hilly drainage basin, 1,270 square miles (3,290 square km) in area, borders the Canterbury Plains to the south. Towns in the riverâ€™s valley, including Waiau and Parnassus, are market centres for the livestock raised in the area. Tributaries include the Lewis, Doubtful, Hope, Hanmer, and Leader rivers. Several gorges along the river are possible sites for hydroelectric-power stations.
