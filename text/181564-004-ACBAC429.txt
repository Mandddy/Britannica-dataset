B.K.S. Iyengar, in full Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar  (born December 14, 1918, Bellur, Karnataka, Indiaâ€”died August 20, 2014, Pune, Maharashtra) Indian teacher and popularizer of Yoga, a system of Indian philosophy.
Iyengar was born into a large impoverished family. A sickly child, he suffered from a distended belly and was unable to hold his head up straight. His physical condition made him a laughingstock among his peers, and his friendlessness hindered his academic achievement. While still in his teens, he turned to Yoga for relief, although not without suffering great physical pain in his effort to master the 200 Yoga postures (asanas). The pain paid off when he began to attract some attention by demonstrating the asanas.
