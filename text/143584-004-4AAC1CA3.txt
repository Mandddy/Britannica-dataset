Venison,  (from Latin venatus, “to hunt”), the meat from any kind of deer; originally, the term referred to any kind of edible game.
Venison resembles beef and mutton in texture, colour, and other general characteristics. It has virtually the same chemical composition as beef but is less fatty. Lean venison roast, before cooking, contains by weight approximately 75 percent water, 20 percent protein, and 2 percent fat; this protein content is about the same as that of a lean beef rump.
