Esperanza Spalding,  (born October 18, 1984, Portland, Oregon, U.S.) American bassist, singer, and composer whose precocious talent and musical adventurousness brought her considerable success both within and beyond the world of jazz.
Spalding grew up in a multilingual multiethnic household (her single mother was of Welsh, Hispanic, and Native American descent, and her father was African American). Inspired by cellist Yo-Yo Ma, whom she saw perform on the children’s television show Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, she taught herself to play the violin at an early age. By the time she was five, she had earned a place in the local community orchestra, the Chamber Music Society of Oregon. Spalding performed with the group for the next 10 years, along the way learning to play the upright bass, which soon became her favoured instrument, and branching into other forms of music, including blues, hip-hop, and funk. After dropping out of high school at age 16, she received a GED and attended Portland State University before transferring to the Berklee College of Music in Boston. From there she earned a bachelor’s degree in music in 2005 and thereafter became, at the age of 20, the school’s youngest teacher. That same year she won a Boston Jazz Society scholarship for outstanding musicianship.
