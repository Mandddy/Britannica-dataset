Sir Robert John Le Mesurier McClure,  (born Jan. 28, 1807, Wexford, County Wexford, Ire.—died  Oct. 17, 1873, London) Irish naval officer who discovered a waterway, known as the Northwest Passage, linking the Pacific and Atlantic oceans through Arctic North America. He completed the route, partly by ship and partly overland, during 1850–54.
In 1850 McClure took command of the Investigator, one of two ships sent to find the British explorer Sir John Franklin, missing in the North American Arctic since 1845. From the Pacific, McClure entered the Bering Strait and, heading eastward north of Alaska, found two entrances to the Northwest Passage around Banks Island, now part of the Northwest Territories of Canada. The Investigator became trapped in the ice of Mercy Bay just north of Banks Island, compelling him to abandon the ship, but his party was rescued by two ships at nearby Melville Island. The rescue ships were in turn abandoned, and the party proceeded on foot to Beechey Island and then returned home by ship. McClure was knighted in 1854.
