Lake Placid 1980 Olympic Winter Games, athletic festival held in Lake Placid, N.Y., U.S., that took place Feb. 13–24, 1980. The Lake Placid Games were the 13th occurrence of the Winter Olympic Games.
The 1980 Games marked the second time the small upstate New York town had hosted the Winter Olympics. But, in the age of television and increasing numbers of spectators, Lake Placid was ill-equipped to handle the demands of a modern Games. Transportation was inadequate to move the crowds, and athletes complained about the confinement of the Olympic Village, which would later be used to house juvenile offenders. While the sports facilities were praised, they were spread throughout the area, making it difficult for spectators to view the events. In addition, organizers were forced to use artificial snow—an Olympic first. International politics also dampened the Games. Only months before, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan, and U.S. Pres. Jimmy Carter was already threatening a boycott of the 1980 Summer Games, scheduled to be held in Moscow.
