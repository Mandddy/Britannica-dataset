Santa Catarina, southern coastal estado (state) of Brazil, bounded to the north by the state of Paraná, to the south by the state of Rio Grande do Sul, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and to the west by Misiones province of Argentina. It is one of the smaller Brazilian states. The capital is Florianópolis, located on coastal Santa Catarina Island. The region was given various names by early Spanish and Portuguese cartographers; the name Santa Catarina is said to have been given in honour of St. Catherine of Alexandria by the Italian navigator Sebastian Cabot, when he was in the service of Spain.
Santa Catarina was part of a larger hereditary captaincy (district administered by a captain) established by the Portuguese crown in 1532, although the first Portuguese settlement, at what is today the port of São Francisco do Sul near the Paraná border, was not made until 1648. The region’s interior highland prairies were used for cattle raising, and early in the 18th century trading posts were opened along the cattle trails leading across the plateaus toward the coastal towns and the northern markets. The captaincy of Santa Catarina was created in 1738 to serve as an outpost in the Portuguese-Spanish territorial wars. It was governed from Rio de Janeiro by the military until 1822, when Brazil became an empire independent of Portugal. A revolution that spread northward from Rio Grande do Sul in 1839 created the short-lived Republic of Santa Catarina in the locality.
