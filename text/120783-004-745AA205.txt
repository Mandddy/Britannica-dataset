Ramkhamhaeng,  (born 1239?—died  1298) third king of Sukhothai in what is now north-central Thailand, who made his young and struggling kingdom into the first major Tai state in 13th-century Southeast Asia.
On the death of his brother, King Ban Muang, about 1279, Ramkhamhaeng inherited his tiny kingdom of only a few hundred square miles. Over the next two decades—by careful diplomacy, shrewd alliances, and military campaigns—he extended his power and influence as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang in what is now Laos, west to the Indian Ocean coast of Myanmar (Burma), and south on the Malay Peninsula to Nakhon Si Thammarat. It is likely that he did not directly rule all this area but rather gained the recognition by local rulers of his suzerainty. He united a region that shared a new faith in Therāvada Buddhism and a hostility toward the Cambodian kingdom of Angkor, which earlier had dominated the region. Missing from the Sukhothai empire was the eastern half of the lower Chao Phraya River valley, which in the 14th century was absorbed by Ramkhamhaeng’s successors and became the core of the new Tai kingdom of Ayutthaya (Siam).
