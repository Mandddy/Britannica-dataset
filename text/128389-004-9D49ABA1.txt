Wilford Woodruff,  (born March 1, 1807, Farmington, Conn., U.S.—died  Sept. 2, 1898, San Francisco, Calif.) fourth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), who issued the proclamation that relinquished the church practice of polygyny, or polygamy as it was popularly called.
Converted in 1833, Woodruff joined the Mormons in Kirtland, Ohio, moved with them to Missouri, to Nauvoo, Ill., and finally to Utah (1847). Woodruff, whose journal has been an important source for Mormon history, was appointed official church historian in 1875. A practicing polygynist as he entered his presidential term (1889–98), he published in 1890 a “revelation,” known as the Manifesto, officially ending plural marriage for Mormons.
