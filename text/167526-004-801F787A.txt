Ashburton River, river in northwestern Western Australia, rising 140 miles (225 km) southwest of Nullagine on the south slopes of the Ophthalmia Range. It flows through a deep valley, southwest then northwest, entering the Indian Ocean near Exmouth Gulf after a sporadic course of about 400 miles (640 km). Principal tributaries include the Hardey, Henry, and Duck rivers. The Ashburton drains fair pastoral country, having generally high temperatures and the greatest rainfall variability (ranging from 1 to 27 inches [25 to 686 mm]) in Australia. The river is usually dry more than 3 miles (5 km) from its mouth. It flows only after exceptional cyclonic storms (“willy-willies”) and may be several miles wide during high flood. Discovered (1861) by Francis Gregory and named by him for William Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton, then president of the Royal Geographical Society, it was the site of an alluvial goldfield active in the 1890s but now defunct.
