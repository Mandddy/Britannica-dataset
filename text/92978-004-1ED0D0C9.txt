Fernando Valenzuela, in full Fernando Valenzuela Anguamea, byname El Toro (“the Bull”)  (born November 1, 1960, Etchohuaquila, Mexico) Mexican professional baseball player whose career spanned 17 seasons in the major leagues of the United States.
Valenzuela was discovered in 1977 by Los Angeles scout Corito Varona while playing in the Mexican League. As a 20-year-old, Valenzuela caught the attention of fans when he pitched for the National League (NL) Los Angeles Dodgers in the opening game of the 1981 season and shut out the Houston Astros. Valenzuela finished the strike-shortened season with a record of 13 wins and 7 losses and led the league in complete games (11), shutouts (8), innings pitched (192), and strikeouts (180). He was named NL Rookie of the Year and became the first rookie player to win the Cy Young Award (given to the best pitcher in each league), while leading the Dodgers to the World Series title. Valenzuela was so popular—a phenomenon known as “Fernandomania”—that attendance increased by an average of 9,000 fans whenever he pitched in road games. He became a cultural icon in the Latino community in the United States and a hero in his home country. Following the 1981 season, Valenzuela returned home to play the winter season with Navojoa in the Mexican Pacific League near his hometown, and Mexican fans filled the stadiums throughout the league to welcome him.
