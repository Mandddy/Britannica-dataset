Videocassette recorder, also spelled video cassette recorder (VCR),  electromechanical device that records, stores, and plays back television programs on a television set by means of a cassette of magnetic tape. A videocassette recorder is commonly used to record television programs broadcast over the air or by cable and to play back commercially recorded cassettes on a television set.
Prototypes of videocassette recorders were developed in the l960s, but the first relatively convenient and low-cost VCR was introduced by the Sony Corporation in 1969. With the subsequent development of the Betamax format by Sony and the VHS format by the Matsushita Corporation in the 1970s, videocassette recorders became sufficiently inexpensive to be purchased by millions of families for use in the home. Both the VHS and Betamax systems use videotape that is 0.5 inch (13 mm) wide, but the two systems are mutually incompatible, and a cassette that is recorded on one system cannot be played back on the other system. A third system using 0.3inch- (8-millimetre-) wide tape was introduced in early 1985.
