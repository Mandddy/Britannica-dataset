Edna Purviance, in full Olga Edna Purviance  (born October 21, 1895?, Paradise Valley, Nevada, U.S.—died January 13, 1958, near Hollywood, California) American movie actress of the silent film era, who played opposite Charlie Chaplin in more than 30 films, including such classic short works as The Tramp (1915), Easy Street (1917), and The Immigrant (1917). She also starred with Chaplin in the feature-length film The Kid (1921).
In early 1915 Chaplin, who had recently signed a contract with the Essanay movie company located near San Francisco at Niles, California, began a search for a leading lady. After rejecting several chorus girls, Chaplin arranged a meeting with Purviance, who was working as a secretary and had become involved in San Francisco’s bohemian life. A Night Out (1915), made soon after that meeting, was the first collaboration of Purviance and Chaplin. Although her role varied from film to film, Purviance almost always appeared as Chaplin’s love interest, bringing a heartfelt gentleness and soft blonde beauty to her roles that sweetly complemented the chaos of Chaplin’s tramp character.
