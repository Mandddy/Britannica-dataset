Ataxite, any iron meteorite containing more than 16 percent nickel. Ataxites, containing taenite as their main mineral, do not show the Widmanst√§tten pattern. The taenite in ataxites is mixed with some kamacite to form an intergrowth called plessite. Ataxites are a rare class; of the 49 iron meteorites whose falls have been observed, none is an ataxite. However, the 60-ton Hoba meteorite, the largest on Earth and found buried on a farm in Namibia in 1920, is an ataxite.
