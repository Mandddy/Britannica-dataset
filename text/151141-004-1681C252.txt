Iskŭr River, also spelled Isker, or Iskar, Latin Oescus,  longest (after the Danube) river in Bulgaria, formed south of Samokov in the Rila Mountains by its headstreams, the Beli (White) Iskŭr and Cherni (Black) Iskŭr. It cuts a 40-mile (65-km) gorge through the Balkan Mountains to bring the high basin of Sofia (1,800 feet [550 metres]) into communication with the Danube tableland. The river empties into the Danube about 20 miles west of Nikopol after a course of 250 miles (402 km). Along its lower course, southeast of Sofia, is a chain of small hydro stations associated with the Iskŭr Reservoir. The Malŭk Iskŭr and Panega are tributaries.
