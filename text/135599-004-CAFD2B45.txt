Stanley Matthews,  (born July 21, 1824, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died March 22, 1889, Washington, D.C.) associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1881–89).
After studying law in Cincinnati, Matthews was admitted to the bar in 1842 and began to practice law in Columbia, Tennessee, while also editing a weekly paper, the Tennessee Democrat. After his return to Cincinnati in 1844 he continued to divide his time between journalism (as editor of the antislavery Cincinnati Morning Herald ) and the law and was soon appointed assistant prosecuting attorney. He served briefly as clerk of the Ohio House of Representatives and then as a judge of common pleas but soon resigned and returned to private practice. He served in the Ohio Senate from 1855 to 1858 and was then appointed U.S. attorney for Ohio’s southern district. In this capacity he was obliged to prosecute a reporter, W.B. Connelly, under the Fugitive Slave Law, generating an ironic notoriety that dogged his professional career.
