Fer-de-lance, any of several extremely venomous snakes of the viper family (Viperidae) found in diverse habitats from cultivated lands to forests throughout tropical America and tropical Asia. The fer-de-lance, known in Spanish as barba amarilla (“yellow chin”), is a pit viper (subfamily Crotalinae)—i.e., distinguished by a small sensory pit between each eye and nostril. It has a broad triangular head and is usually about 1.2 to 2 metres (4 to 7 feet) long. It is gray or brown, marked by a series of black-edged diamonds often bordered in a lighter colour. Its bite can be fatal to humans.
The common French name fer-de-lance, or “lance head,” originally referred to the Martinique lancehead (Bothrops lanceolatus) found on the island of the same name in the West Indies. Several authoritative sources, however, frequently apply the name to the terciopelo (B. asper) and the common lancehead (B. atrox) of South America. The name fer-de-lance has also been used collectively to describe all snakes of the Central and South American genus Bothrops and the Asian genus Trimeresurus. Among these snakes, all venomous, are the habus (T. flavoviridis and related species, such as Wagler’s pit viper [T. wagleri]); the jararaca (B. jararaca); the wutu, or urutu (B. alternatus); and the jumping viper, or tommygoff (B. nummifera).
