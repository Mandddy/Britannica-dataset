Alain-Fournier, pseudonym of Henri-Alban Fournier  (born Oct. 3, 1886, La Chapelle-d’Angillon, Cher, France—killed in action Sept. 22, 1914, in the vicinity of Épargue, near Verdun)  French writer whose only completed novel, Le Grand Meaulnes (1913; The Wanderer, or The Lost Domain), is a modern classic.
Based on his happy childhood in a remote village in central France, Alain-Fournier’s novel reflects his longing for a lost world of delight. The hero, an idealistic but forceful schoolboy, runs away and at a children’s party in a decrepit country house meets a beautiful girl. The rest of the novel describes his search for her and for the house and the mood of wonderment he knew there. Its outstanding quality is evocation of an atmosphere of otherworldly nostalgia, against a realistically observed rural background. Other works, mainly published posthumously, include a correspondence (2 vol., 1948) with the critic Jacques Rivière, his brother-in-law.
