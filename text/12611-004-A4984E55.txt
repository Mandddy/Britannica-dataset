Thomas Cranmer,  (born July 2, 1489, Aslacton, Nottinghamshire, England—died March 21, 1556, Oxford) the first Protestant archbishop of Canterbury (1533–56), adviser to the English kings Henry VIII and Edward VI. As archbishop, he put the English Bible in parish churches, drew up the Book of Common Prayer, and composed a litany that remains in use today. Denounced by the Catholic queen Mary I for promoting Protestantism, he was convicted of heresy and burned at the stake.
Cranmer was the second son of Thomas Cranmer and Agnes (née Hatfield). His father seems to have belonged to the lowest rank of the gentry; at any rate, he had only enough property to endow his eldest son, John, so that Thomas and his younger brother were destined for the church. After experiencing the teaching of a “marvellous severe and cruel schoolmaster,” whose ministrations Cranmer later maintained instilled in him a permanent uncertainty and pliability, the boy went on to Cambridge in 1503. In 1510 or 1511 he was elected to a fellowship at Jesus College but was soon compelled to vacate because he married a relative of the landlady of the Dolphin Inn. During this time he earned his living by teaching at Buckingham (later Magdalene) College, leaving his wife to lodge at the Dolphin; out of this arrangement grew a later story that he had started out in life as a hostler.
